You\u2019ll be disappointed. Write for the community that is on Medium.\nIf not for other people, write for yourself. Writing is a form of therapy.\nWriting is a great investment in yourself and a fabulous use of your time.\nwww.class-central.com\nWho cares if other people read what you think? This is an age of discovery. If you\u2019re young you have nothing to lose! Write for the sake of exploring topics you\u2019ve always wished you\u2019d explore but never had the time to.\nSince I\u2019ve started writing my blog, whenever I am reading an article or book, I always make sure to make notes/ take screenshots (if I\u2019m reading on my phone), so that I can come back to it and write a blog post about my thoughts.\nThis blog post is not going to be your regular: HEY CHECK OUT THIS 10 STEP LIST.\nNo. This is simply going to be the number one things I\u2019ve learnt by having a blog. It\u2019s actually very simple.\nThe Number 1 Thing I\u2019ve Learnt Is That the Community is More Valuable Than the Views\nI\u2019ve met some INCREDIBLE people on this platform. I am very grateful for all their feedback and articles.\nI still remember the first handful I was in touch with. Their encouraging words, strategy, and punctuality inspired me.\nIn this post, I will be giving shout-outs to people that have helped me along the way, bloggers that I continue to read, come back to, and am still in touch with (mostly.)\nZak Slayback, for example, kept responding to my tweets to him. He\u2019s opened the door to my view on communicating to writers.\nTom Kuegler almost singlehandedly taught me how to blog. His Newsletter is one of the best things on Medium. And his blog posts are on point. He\u2019s not exactly what I want to become by using this platform. But he\u2019s being himself and he\u2019s owning it. He\u2019s doing very well.\nfanpop.com\nEnrique Fiallo was nice to reference me in one of his blogs about motivating other writers to keep writing. We bounced a couple of responses back and forth, which I am also very thankful for.\nZat Rana is definitely one of the best philosophical voices on Medium. He writes well and takes time to respond to comments. He also does not shy away from encouraging other writers.\nJoao Nascimento continuously provides constructive criticism to my blog posts. I love responding to what he has to say and adjusting my blogs in accordance to his views. I truly value all he has to say. I also plan on working closely with him in the future, especially on our publication: The Humanists of Our Generation, which seeks to highlight reflective voices on this platform.\nJennifer Taylor took the time to respond to my email to her asking her advice on pursuing a law degree. GUYS! I mean\u2026 If people aren\u2019t humbled by stuff like this \u2014 then who are you? You must out of this world. Since then, we have exchanged a couple back & forth.\nZachary Forget is one of those gents that I connected with early on. We still keep in touch and encourage each other from time to time. Man.. I bet if I asked him how to set up a Newsletter, he\u2019d take the time to send me a detailed email to get through it. And check it out\u2026 I don\u2019t personally know him, nor have I spoken to him. Our dialogues are through Medium alone. That is the what this platform is about, it lets you connect to a community of aspiring thinkers and writers.\nMatt McAlexander is one of the more recent connections I\u2019ve made. He pointed out some mistakes I\u2019ve made in my most popular blog post on the Bret Weintein Controversy. His attitude and helpful advice was very beneficial to me. I instantly went to his blog page and was surprised he didn\u2019t write more. I wish he did. The one piece I read was incredible, though. Truly analytical and personal. I love personal blogs like that one.\nI stumbled across another personal blog by Melissa Webb who provided a heartfelt response to my blog post on keeping positive in the pursuit of a career in the arts.\nThere are incredible people that have gone through a lot on this website. The popular professors, Heather Heying and her husband Bret Weinstein, are among considerable mentions. These two are actually some of the most important voices of this decade and they are Medium.\nMy most popular post The Controversy of Bret Weinstein Explained is about what happened to Prof. Weinstein and his wife, why they were fired, ad why they\u2019re \u201cintellectual celebrities\u201d at the moment.\nThe Controversy of Bret Weinstein Explained \u2014 The Evergreen Scandal\nBret Weinstein is an evolutionary biologist that made national headlines for being a racist. So\u2026 what exactly happened\u2026medium.com\nI do not cover every area possible. At least their case is being discussed.\nNonetheless, it is a great privilege to be able to have people like this read your content.\nYou get the idea. There\u2019s many more I can mention. People on this platform ARE FANTASTIC.\nMedium is where the attention is at the moment.\nWhat Are We Writing For?\nIt does not matter whether we make it big. I believe that it is important to write and reflect.\nawaitingthemuse.wordpress.com\nImagine if everyone was doing what you are doing. That is, imagine if everyone in the world took the time to reflect on serious issues. What would the world look like? Why don\u2019t we find that interesting?\nI don\u2019t want to get paid for this. I don\u2019t think I ever wanted to. I want to see people like this living life and bouncing ideas off of each other.\nWriting on Medium is invaluable and revolutionary.\nI am thankful for this medium (pun intended) and everyone who is on it.\nIt\u2019s all about the work. Let\u2019s keep working.\nSee you at 200.\n:)\nIf you want to read my previous milestone\u2026.. Check it out below.

I took classes on Russian history, watched documentaries on Ukrainian history, followed the Maidan revolution\u2019s impact on Ukrainian politics, and so forth.\nWhen the war broke out, I became obsessed with the news cycle, as many of us were. I took books out from the library on Putin, read biographies, listened to a few podcasts on the conflict per day, and couldn\u2019t stop watching DW News. Many of us focused on this conflict obsessively in the initial days of the invasion. But it is important to focus on it even now when the fighting has dwindled.\nI also wrote an article on the importance of focusing on Ukraine for the Macdonald-Laurier Institute, Canada\u2019s leading independent think-tank, based out of Ottawa, the capital. My points were simple, but remain true even more so today, so I will reiterate them.\nPhoto by Eugene on Unsplash\nUkraine has already been in a conflict with Russia since 2014 as a result of Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea and its backing of pro-Russian separatist groups in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine. From 2014\u20132022, more than 14,000 lives were lost and 2 million people were displaced.\nThese tolls are rapidly worsening due to Russia\u2019s latest and radical escalation of aggression.\nYet even in light of Putin\u2019s full-scale invasion, some are still not sympathetic. It is important therefore to outline a number of reasons why Canadians should pay attention to this conflict. Similar causes for concern apply to conflicts in Syria, Myanmar, Nigeria, and elsewhere, but they are acutely true in the context of Ukraine.\n1. Lives Lost\nIt is very difficult to say for certain what the death toll will be in Ukraine.\nAnd it should go without saying that the most important reason anyone should care about Ukraine is because of the loss of life. Shelling has targeted large cities in Ukraine from Kharkiv to Mariupol to Kyiv. According to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) as of 10 April 2022, there have been 1,842 killed citizens and 2,493 injured. This is excluding Russian casualties, of course.\nThis included:\na total of 1,842 killed (474 men, 301 women, 28 girls, and 50 boys, as well as 70 children and 919 adults whose sex is yet unknown)\na total of 2,493 injured (287 men, 216 women, 49 girls, and 50 boys, as well as 134 children and 1,757 adults whose sex is yet unknown)\nIn Donetsk and Luhansk regions: 1,916 casualties (656 killed and 1,260 injured)\nOn Government-controlled territory: 1,566 casualties (583 killed and 983 injured)\nOn territory controlled by the self-proclaimed \u2018republics\u2019: 350 casualties (73 killed and 277 injured)\nFighting has decreased. And the situation at the borders of Ukraine with neighboring nations has calmed down from the initial surge of refugees. I write about my brief experience at the border here. Loss of life will nonetheless continue as long as Putin continues this war.\nPhoto by UX Gun on Unsplash\n2. Russia as a Regional Threat\nSome countries near Russia have avoided joining NATO for reasons that are above this post. Before the invasion, neither Sweden nor Finland had shown any serious fear about Russia\u2019s potential expansion westward. This can be intuited from the fact that they have not made significant efforts to join NATO before Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. That changed on February 24th, 2022. Both Sweden and Finland now realize that if this can happen to Ukraine, then it can happen to any non-aligned state.\nUkraine is a country of 45 million people and is, after Russia, the largest country in Europe by landmass. The Baltic States, such as Estonia, only have a few million citizens located inside their borders, and they field smaller militaries than Ukraine. Without NATO membership, they would be at the whim of Putin\u2019s expansionist visions. Many countries in Europe that were previously under the Warsaw Pact fear the same, such as Czechia, Slovakia, and Hungary. If Putin sees NATO as divided or its frontline states as weak, there is a far greater risk of Russia engaging in a direct conflict with NATO, which would have dire implications for countries like Canada and the world more generally.\u2063\n3. Implications to the Rules-Based Global Order\nWe should also remember that this is not necessarily just a war against Ukraine. This is a war against the concepts of sovereignty, international law, and global stability. If the international order does not respond with solidarity, it will be a sign to aggressors that they can do as they choose. As of now, the European Union, NATO, UN and other organizations have responded in striking solidarity, making sanctions all the more effective.\nChina, Iran, Syria, Venezuela, and most likely even North Korea, are watching this situation closely. If the liberal international order\u2019s solidarity falters, other autocratic countries may follow a similar path. This response, therefore, has serious implications for other potential flashpoints, such as the heightened tensions between China and Taiwan.\n4. The Refugee Crisis Continues\nAs I mentioned above, refugees have lessened to neighboring nations. But that doesn\u2019t mean that people will not continue to come in the coming days and months. This conflict can escalate. No one really knows what is going on in Putin\u2019s head and, from what we have seen, his views are stifled by (1) yes men in his inner circle and (2) by a sincerely small inner circle with very little variety in thought.\nMore than 4 million Ukrainians have left the country. And many more million have been internally displaced. These are devastating numbers.\nPhoto by Levi Meir Clancy on Unsplash\n5. The Largest European War Since World War II\nAs this is the largest war on European soil since World War II, we can expect unprecedented economic and social impacts globally. These are hard to predict with any degree of certainty because of the many factors involved but they are worth mentioning nonetheless.\nWe have already seen the ruble, the Russian currency, crash to all-time lows. Video footage from Russia shows Russians standing in long lines for ATMs to take out any savings they have. If sanctions continue, we can expect to see more protests in Russia and perhaps even a bigger backlash against these protests, which can turn violent.\nIn the early days of the invasion, we saw more than 2,000 protestors throughout Russia, half of which came from Moscow, detained and imprisoned. That is not to mention what will most likely be a decades-long rebuilding process of Ukraine after this conflict is over. Ukraine is already a poor country, excluded from some of the economic freedoms of belonging to the EU. Even if Ukrainian membership is hastened, as we have seen strong evidence of in recent weeks, it would be a long and arduous path for Ukraine to rebuild its country and economy to business-as-usual conditions. Russia will have a lot to pay and account for.\nWhy This All Matters\nTo restate, the most important reason the world should care about Ukraine is that we are talking about real people who are losing their lives. Yes, childhood memories may be lost; museums that housed precious Ukrainian artifacts will never be restored; but most importantly, we are talking about moms, fathers, daughters, sons who will never see another day.\nThat is all to say, that we should focus on Ukraine for the same reason we should care about the Kurdish minority in Syria, the Uyghurs in China, and the Rohingya in Bangladesh. We should care about Ukraine because of the precious value of life.\nWe may have seen solidarity from Europe in the last two weeks. However, we should be reminded of how little it takes to divide us. Self-interest often dominates our politics. And Europe has not been so receptive to refugees fleeing the bombing of metropolitan cities like Aleppo before. Putin banked on our divisions. This time he was wrong about our unity and humanity. What will it take for the next autocrat to be right?\nThis article was originally published in the Macdonald-Laurier Institute.

In his now-infamous essay, \u201cOn the historical unity of Russians and Ukrainians,\u201d published in July 2021, Putin goes so far to deny Ukraine any claim to nationhood and makes his intentions to integrate Ukraine into Russia very clear.\nIt is now even more relevant to make this case for Ukrainian sovereignty, as pundits like Candace Owens, among others, have been swallowing Putin\u2019s propaganda and proclaiming it to millions of keen listeners.\nPhoto by Social Income on Unsplash\nTo be fair, maybe some of us have also wondered whether Putin\u2019s claims are, at least partially, correct. We remember stories of the Kievan Rus and how empires collided on Ukrainian territory. When we hear the Ukrainian language in the news, we hear its phonetic similarity to Russian. They share the Cyrillic alphabet, Azbuka. Their economies are integrated. Many Russians have families in Ukraine. So, we may wonder to ourselves, to what extent are Ukraine and Russia historically linked?\nPutting aside questions of language, in this article, I would like to focus on a brief historical retelling of Ukrainian\u2019s recent history and why Putin is horribly wrong in his historical revisionism.\nUkraine and Russia indeed share a history. But their history is not as unique as Putin implies. In fact, Ukraine also shares an extensive history with Poland. And few are suggesting that Poland has a right to take back Lviv, for example, a city that was once a part of its empire.\nPutin starts his historical revisionism with The Kievan Rus (862\u20131242), a loosely-collected political federation in modern-day Ukraine, Belarus, and parts of Russia. Its capital, Kyiv, finally fell to the Mongol Invasion which crippled much of Eastern Europe in the 13th century. Putin claims that this heritage is shared and binds the nations together. This may be somewhat true, but it oversimplifies a complex past. Indeed, in the words of the historian Matthew E. Lenoe, \u201cthere\u2019s no continuous line to be traced from this loose river confederation to the Russian state.\u201d The many empires that collided over the centuries that followed made that historical lineage nearly impossible to delineate.\nIt may be true that both Russia and Ukraine are predominantly Slavic nations located east of the Carpathian mountains. And for some of their recent history, from the 17th century onwards, many traversed from Moscow to Kyiv, and vice versa, to emigrate, study at universities, and engage in political disputes. Crimea and Odesa were common vacation spots for Russians in the summer, luring in many Russian tzars with the warmth of the Black Sea. And Russian cities as far east as Vladivostok and Khabarovsk saw significant Ukrainian migration in the 20th century.\n\u201c[T]here\u2019s no continuous line to be traced from this loose river confederation to the Russian state.\u201d \u2014 Matthew E. Lenoe\nSo, from the 17th century, by geographic and political necessity, their pasts have been connected. However, their language, culture, literature, and politics significantly diverged before then. Indeed, Kyiv has a much longer history than Moscow and had a thousand years of history before developing any intimate bonds with the Russian capital.\nAs many others have noted, Kyiv was a booming city at a time when Moscow only resembled a humble village. And, more alarmingly, Ukraine and its people were the recipients of Russian wrath throughout much of the 20th century. If we look at history, we see that the only time Russia had any grasp over Ukraine was when it used force.\nEarly Stages of Ukrainian Resistance\nLike many other European states, Ukraine first saw political autonomy after World War I with the founding of the Ukraine People\u2019s Republic, in 1917. After establishing its autonomy, the Bolsheviks, which at the time were swiftly becoming the ruling political party in Russia, entered a war with Ukraine over its borders and territory.\nIn 1921, the Bolsheviks finally consolidated their control over Ukrainian resistance and integrated Ukraine into its newly-formed Soviet Union. Putin, and others who view this period of Ukrainian resistance as irrelevant to their history, are ignoring how the Kremlin treated Ukrainians in the years that followed.\nAfter Ukraine was integrated into the USSR, Joseph Stalin sought to destabilize any Ukrainian hope of becoming a sovereign state again. He, therefore, enforced agricultural policies that would (1) help Russia feed its people in light of growing demand and (2) prevent Ukrainization and political upheaval in Ukrainian territory. The Great Ukrainian Famine (1932\u20131933), also known as the Holodomor, was one of the most palpable and extreme forms of immediate aggression Ukraine felt, following the slaughter the Bolsheviks inflicted on citizens of the Ukraine People\u2019s Republic from 1917\u20131919. The Ukrainian parliament only managed to recognize the Holodomor as an act of genocide against the Ukrainian people in 2006.\nMost historians agree with depicting the Holodomor as ethnonational genocide because of strong evidence that Stalin\u2019s policies had an \u201cethnonational coloration,\u201d in the words of the historian Serhii Plokhy. In his book, The Gates of Europe, Plokhy explains that \u201c[the Holodomor] left Ukrainian society severely traumatized, crushing its capacity for open resistance to the regime for generations to come.\u201d Therefore, Ukraine\u2019s early stages of integration did not come without great cost to the Ukrainian people. Ukraine\u2019s political autonomy in 1917, was met with slaughter and subsequent famine that killed an estimated 7\u201310 million people, according to a joint statement by the United Nations.\nDuring World War II, Ukraine became a battlefield for Axis and Soviet Allied forces. Many Ukrainians fought alongside Russians in some of the most deadly battles in World War II, from Stalingrad, Moscow, Kharkiv, to Kursk. Four Ukrainian cities were known as \u201chero cities\u201d in the USSR due to the great casualties the German forces caused there (Odesa, Sevastopol, Kyiv, and Kerch). More than 7 million Ukrainians lost their lives throughout World War II, including citizens, which added up to 15 percent of Ukraine\u2019s population at the time.\nAfter World War II, the size of Ukraine increased by 15 percent, but at what cost? 10 million Ukrainians were left without a roof over their heads. More than 40 percent of Ukraine\u2019s wealth and 80 percent of its industrial and agricultural equipment were lost.\nLeading up to the dissolution of the USSR, Ukraine also experienced the single biggest nuclear disaster in the world, at the nuclear power plant, Chernobyl, in 1986. On closer inspection, we once again see that it was largely due to poor policies issued by the Kremlin that the powerplant malfunctioned.\nSome Ukrainian officials were indeed invited to Moscow to consult policymakers, but their input fell on deaf ears. Chernobyl exposed at least 3 million people to radiation, amassing radiation comparable to the explosion of five hundred Hiroshima bombs. The landmass of Belgium across Ukraine and Belarus was contaminated and many had to flee their homes never to return. Here, once again, we see the Kremlin\u2019s self-interest and brutal ambivalence over Ukraine and its people.\nDespite these events, Putin has repeatedly claimed that Ukraine was the main benefactor of the fall of the Soviet Union. But this is far from the case. Ukraine paid dearly by the forceful integration of the Ukraine People\u2019s Republic into the USSR. By the end of the millennium, only around 2 or 3 percent of the population had lives they were comfortable with. And more than half of Ukrainians could barely afford food. If anything, we could argue that it was Russia that was the main benefactor of these tremendous losses in Ukraine. In the words of the historian Dominic Lieven, \u201cWithout Ukraine\u2019s population, industry and agriculture, early-20th-century Russia would have ceased to be a great power.\u201d\nBy briefly looking at history, we see that Ukraine was greatly impoverished and wronged at the hands of Russia. Yet, Putin still aims to take hold of Ukraine.\nPhoto by Robert Anasch on Unsplash\nResistance Today\nFast forward a few decades and Ukraine still faces corruption and political unrest due to the instability the USSR left them. Upon Viktor Yanukovych\u2019s removal as President of Ukraine in 2014, after the Maidan Revolution which claimed the lives of 121 citizens, Putin\u2019s influence over Ukraine waned. Yanukovych was easy to manipulate due to his public proclivity for corruption. Putin took advantage of this and supported Yanukovych in 2004 and 2010 and ultimately granted him asylum in 2014.\nTaking further advantage of the tumultuous state Ukraine was in, Russia annexed Crimea in 2014. The annexation of the Crimean peninsula had unexpected results, however. It drew much of Ukraine closer to the West. Donetsk and Luhansk became warzones with Russian-backed separatists destabilizing the regions.\nThe United Kingdom and the United States, among other world-leading economies, began investing large amounts into Ukraine\u2019s military. Its forces were much stronger and better equipped than the military Russia faced in 2014. Putin knew this and after many years of consideration began amassing large swaths of troops on Ukraine\u2019s border with Belarus and Russia. Finally, Putin ordered a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022.\nSince the invasion, any semblance of control has been difficult to establish. The Ukrainian army has trumped most of the world\u2019s expectations \u2014 especially Putin\u2019s. It is now increasingly apparent that Putin must come to terms with the fact that Ukraine will never belong to Russia.\nSummary\nFrom the time of the Kievan Rus until now, Ukraine had a tumultuous history. Many nationalities and ethnicities from the Khazars, Cossacks, Vikings, to the Mongols, Poles, and Lithuanians, to name but a few, all collided here. It is therefore very difficult to trace any coherent line between these nations, let alone make injunctions based on them that would justify annexing sovereign states. If we were to do so, we would have to question many of the borders in Europe \u2014 and, moreover, the world.\nUkraine\u2019s recent history is riddled with injustices inflicted on it by Russia. Putin\u2019s claims to Ukrainian lands are therefore not only unfounded but put to international attention Russia\u2019s moral accountability to Ukraine and the necessity of paying significant reparations to Ukraine for its long history of aggression toward its people.\nBoth Stalin and Hitler sought to claim the breadbasket of Europe for themselves which resulted in the death of millions. Today, Putin is aiming to do the same. And it is now clear that Putin, too, must learn the hard way that Ukrainians value their sovereignty more than life itself.\nThis article was originally published on Disinfowatch.\nBefore you go\u2026\n\ud83d\udde3 I love connecting with fellow thinkers.

Where are these Nazis? The president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy is Jewish, in the end. Many of his family members were victims of the Holocaust.\nOn the other hand, few have highlighted how close Putin is to real fascists in Europe. In this article, I would like to clarify the presence of Nazis in Ukraine and show how accepting Putin has been to his fascist allies in the rest of Europe.\nPhoto by Valery Tenevoy on Unsplash\nNazis in Ukraine\nAre there Nazis and neo-Nazis in Ukraine? Yes, as there are in Hungary, Austria, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and elsewhere. Are they a real threat to Ukrainian stability? No. Paradoxically, neo-Nazis should be more of a concern in the rest of Europe. Let\u2019s have a brief look at the most potent neo-Nazi groups in Ukraine.\nUkraine\u2019s largest right-wing group, Azov, was founded, like other far-right militia groups in Ukraine, during the 2014 Maidan revolution. Azov was founded by former members of the neo-Nazi paramilitary group, Patriot of Ukraine. This militia has been fighting against Russian troops in Ukraine from 2014 onward, which is one of the reasons Ukraine officials have not shown any significant protest against its establishment. By November 2014, Azov was fully integrated into the National Guard of Ukraine.\nAzov\u2019s military capacity does not exceed more than 2,000 soldiers. In comparison to Ukraine\u2019s military of 200,000 soldiers, or so, Azov is a small unit with little military influence. Azov\u2019s main threat is in its various social media misinformation campaigns that show them assisting the poorest in Ukraine during the pandemic, among other things, which may garner some popularity.\nOther far-right militia groups include Tradition and Order, Sokil, Katechon, Freikorps, Karpatska Sich, and others. Most of these have had public affiliation with Azov and, according to both international and domestic analysts, have received significant private funding from Ukraine\u2019s oligarchs, effectively making them patented armies.\nAnother previously potent far-Right group in Ukraine was the political party Svoboda (\u201cFreedom\u201d), which was also present during the Maidan Revolution in 2013 and 2014, in Kyiv. They served a purpose in the Kyiv square, as police officers opened fire on civilians. However, their motives became clear and few sympathized with them in the coming months and years. The party was most popular in the 2000s and early 2010s when it gathered 10.45% of the 2012 parliamentary election. Presently, it only holds one seat in the Verkhovna Rada.\nThe Ukrainian journalist, Mariam Naiem, who is of Afghani origin, rightly claims that the coverage of neo-Nazi groups in Ukraine is overblown, mainly due to Russian propaganda. Indeed, many far-Right political parties, including those in Germany, Spain, Austria, and France, had more than 13% of parliamentary seats in national elections. Compare that with the combined 2% of the 2019 parliamentary vote that the far-right parties of Ukraine gained (these included the National Corps, Freedom, and Right Sector).\nThe most influential European right-wing populist political party, which has been described as \u201csoft fascism,\u201d is Fidesz in Hungary, led by Viktor Orban. Orban has been criticized due to his relative silence toward Russia\u2019s violation of Ukrainian sovereignty. He has also been vocally against immigration from the Middle East and elsewhere in the world, describing migrants fleeing from war-torn countries as \u201cpoison.\u201d\nWhen it comes to the Ukrainian government, there is no significant presence of any right-wing Ukrainian nationalist force. In fact, in light of Viktor Yanukovych\u2019s removal as president in 2014, most of the crucial positions in the established provisional government were Russian speakers from eastern Ukraine, an area that has been politically more pro-Russian than western Ukraine. Positions from the ministry of defense, internal affairs, the speaker of parliament, and state security were Russian speakers, first and foremost.\nAs the Yale historian, Timothy Snyder notes in The Road to Unfreedom, only three of the eighteen cabinet positions of spring 2014, were held by the Svoboda party. \u201c[T]his was not a government of the Right in any meaningful sense.\u201d The two far-Right politicians who ran for the Ukrainian presidency both received less than 1% of the vote, Snyder explains. Ukraine, in contrast to other European nations, did not have any popular far-Right Ukrainian nationalists in parliament.\nPhoto by Klaus Wright on Unsplash\nPutin\u2019s Fascist Allies\nNow that we briefly looked at why we do not have any overt reason to focus on fascism in Ukraine, we can turn to the fact that Putin\u2019s international enablers tend to be fascist. This should concern him since he has established himself as the denazifier of Ukraine.\nMany fascists applauded Russia\u2019s initial invasion of Ukraine in 2014. Examples include vocal American white supremacists Richard Spencer, Matthew Heimbach, and David Duke. Spencer has also put into question if Crimea was annexed by force. In an interview with Russia Insider in 2018, Spencer claimed,\n\u201cUkraine, Kiev, lie at the heart of the creation of the Russian state, they are effectively tied to Russia. I don\u2019t blame Russians for wanting to maintain this territory and maintain a buffer zone against NATO.\u201d\nSpencer further claimed that Putin is the undisputed \u201cworld champion.\u201d Concerningly, Putin\u2019s fandom reaches further than the American continent.\nIn Europe, Polish, Hungarian, Bulgarian, Italian, Greek, Swedish, and other far-Right political parties praised Putin for his efforts to unite Ukraine and Russia. In Poland, Konrad R\u0119kas spread the Kremlin\u2019s propaganda that Jews dominated Ukraine. In Hungary, the fascist party Jobbik repeatedly praised Putin and is rumored to be funded by Russia, since it has more funds than its Hungarian followers would allow for. In Bulgaria, the fascist party initially launched its political campaign in Moscow. In Greece, Golden Dawn released statements against sanctioning Russia over its invasion of Ukraine in 2015. In Italy, The National Front\u2019s Matteo Salvini, the former Deputy Prime Minister of Italy, claimed in 2019 that Putin is \u201cthe best statesman currently on earth.\u201d\nSummary\nTo reiterate, Ukraine has neo-Nazi groups. They are not limited to Azov. However, the presence of neo-Nazis is not exclusive to Ukraine. As I have shown, some country\u2019s far-Right parties, such as Jobbik in Hungary, boast potent support.\nIf Putin cared about the presence of neo-Nazis in Ukraine, he would condemn the support he has received from the many far-Right groups I have mentioned in this article. Putin\u2019s true intentions are clear, however. He merely wants to restore an imagined history, finding excuses to violate the sovereignty of a nation that wants nothing to do with his imperialistic ambitions.\nBefore you go\u2026\n\ud83d\udde3 I love connecting with fellow thinkers.

I learned things, piece by piece, and owe whatever career I have in large part due to my research on psychology, motivation, and getting things done.\nPutting my learnings into practice has paid off. I\u2019m working on a full-time assignment as the editorial director of WorkOS. I previously worked with a lot of clients and people with my own editorial studio Wonder Shuttle. I wrote a book and compiled another. I could do side projects like Prologue.\nI do the time blocking. I did the pomodoros. I procrastinate productively. I tried the dymaxion sleep cycle (don\u2019t do it!). I\u2019ve made SMART goals. I write regularly. I do deep work. I go for walks.\nBut 10 years into my career, I am also definitely starting to bump up against the limits of personal productivity. There is an asymptote that no amount of personal productivity can change. Here are three, of many, limits that I\u2019m experiencing:\nFinitude: The limit of the body\nSoftware might make a person feel infinite, but absolutely no amount of productivity is going to be enough to drown out the screaming limits of the human body. I am just one person, and I don\u2019t even drink coffee. I have a capacity for writing. I can only move the mouse so fast. My eyes get tired. Even with a perfectly efficient eight-hour work day, each one of us can process a mere 96 five-minute tasks. And the Sisyphean truth: each Slack message, email, etc., can create another one.\nI need to decide what to do every day, and to decide is to kill off all other possibilities. Not deciding is also a decision, to not save even one of those possibilities. And this happens every moment of every day, whether I like it or not.\nThis is actually really difficult for a person like me, obsessed with productivity, to accept. Productivity is based on the premise that you can have it all. It promises, \u201cHey, you can do everything you need to do. There\u2019s a hack, somewhere!\u201d And there is, but the best productivity hack is a team \u2014 actual other people \u2014 and that requires leadership and resources. (And even then, a team is also finite!)\nI found this word \u201cfinitude,\u201d and much consolation on the topic, from another productivity maniac, Oliver Burkeman\u2019s Four Thousand Weeks, which I\u2019ll definitely recommend in my newsletter. Long story short: There are many things that can\u2019t (and probably weren\u2019t meant to) be solved, even with superhuman amounts of productivity.\nPresence: The limit of the mind\nI actually find on some of my more productive days \u2014 getting through a lot of dread administrative work, calls that took weeks to schedule, etc. \u2014 that I\u2019m the least present. There are some days where, at the end of it, I couldn\u2019t even remember what I experienced beyond the past hour. And no wonder, my consciousness floated through hundreds of tabs and windows.\nEspecially bolstered with technology, productivity seems exhausting by design. It\u2019s a trade of personal energy for creating value. I\u2019m typing this up at 8PM on a Tuesday night, and I\u2019m wiped, but it\u2019s the only time I\u2019ve made to write all week. Sometimes I don\u2019t even look forward to it anymore. But hey, I\u2019m productive.\nIt takes more than a second to snap out of this attitude \u2014 to settle into writing, to get back into working slowly. And that\u2019s the special thing about presence. It actually requires personal energy \u2014 to settle in, to transition out, to relax and be in the moment. I build those empty spaces of time into my schedule now, and it\u2019s made all the difference in the world. I do fewer things, but I\u2019m more present, and can be infinitely more effective.\nPurpose: The limit of the soul\nThis is the most significant challenge. Productivity is appealing, at least partially, to those who seek refuge from the need to decide to make tradeoffs. Those who buy into productivity also buy into agency, self-improvement, and progress. If you\u2019re like me, you like \u201cAll of the above.\u201d\nSometimes, this works. But more often than not, the best productivity hack is almost always to do less. More often than not, there is too much work in progress. Productivity would urge that you find a better way, but the truth is you\u2019ll need to draw a boundary. You need to decide what to prioritize, and let everything else hit the ground.\nAt some point, I don\u2019t put everything down gently. I let gravity do the work, some things will break, so that the one thing I decide to hold up with both of my hands will survive and, perhaps, thrive.\nThat\u2019s it, right? That\u2019s pretty much the harsh truth about how productivity works. It\u2019s really just about focus, picking one thing, and accomplishing or completing it, then resting, and then, doing the next thing.\nThis reads like the limit of the body, but it\u2019s really about the soul. We decide who and what we love, and care for, by choosing to spend time and energy with them. And in doing so, we love them more. You could make the spiritual case that love is actually more like a muscle, or a multiplier; the more love you have, the more love you have to give. I believe in that too! I\u2019m just not sure how to practically reconcile the two at this point.\nSo many limits\nSometimes, I\u2019m scared \u2014 will I never have enough time to write well? \u2014 but I realize it\u2019s all just a variation of the same fear. Am I doing enough? Am I being enough? Will people think I\u2019m good enough?\nI write about personal infrastructure, and it\u2019s great \u2014 it has really augmented my process \u2014 but it\u2019s also not enough. Nothing will be enough. There are no amount of integrations, prioritization frameworks, or zettelkastens, that will break through the limits of personal productivity.\nPerhaps it\u2019s my sunk cost bias, but I\u2019m still appreciating a lot of the productivity stuff. It\u2019s kept me well creatively, and helped me shake off creative blocks. Again, I wouldn\u2019t have experienced so many of the things I\u2019m grateful for. But I now keep in mind that productivity is meant to support the life I want to live. But it will not grant me, or you, a chance to live more than once.\nIf you enjoyed this article, you\u2019ll love my Best of Books newsletter, where I send three of the best books to your inbox every month.

My friend Rick and I talked about it a few months ago, and I\u2019d been copying and pasting the links down in an Airtable record (Haha \u2014 not kidding though). I\u2019ve written 1,000+ notecards at this point, at least 200 of which made it into this book and another 200 will make it into a future one, and I\u2019ve really enjoyed the process. I want to summarize and respond the old web 2.0 way, at this blog (although you\u2019ll probably read the thread on Twitter):\nThe Note-Taking Bullshit Industrial Complex\nOkay firstly, this is something that\u2019s been bugging me, which Max Nussenbaum summarizes well, \u201cAn entire digital ecosystem has sprung up of productivity gurus who claim that taking notes on what you read and organizing your ideas the way they do is the secret to supercharging your creative output.\u201d A beautiful summary.\nI recently saw the merchant of one of these courses \u2014 who shall remain nameless out of courtesy, because I don\u2019t actually have a problem with them, and to keep this piece smoke-free \u2014 take a photo announcing that he\u2019d started taking paper notes.\nThis same merchant had constantly announced how successful their course had sold (I missed the memo on how well their students were using it).\nThis is the absurdity of the internet now. It really wasn\u2019t about note-taking; it was about the marketing, the positioning, and the beautifully-crafted promise \u2014 of speed, effortlessness, and all your problems solved with this one simple course. Note-taking just happens to be the topic feasible enough to get someone to believe, \u201cHey, this might actually work!\u201d\nSpoiler alert: The course doesn\u2019t live up to the promise. I\u2019ve bought one of these about hiring virtual assistants, I didn\u2019t get much out of it, and I happily got my money back. For that specific course, I\u2019d considered it because it was on a shiny new platform and I wasn\u2019t feeling great about my very analog process, but I found the price to be exorbitant and I didn\u2019t think I was missing out on much.\nI\u2019m glad to know that it wasn\u2019t just me, and that I wasn\u2019t wrong.\nOne final note: Modern capitalism has a tendency to take something very ordinary and make it extraordinary, and re-package it in luxury, and mark it up by 4,000%. If you\u2019re thinking of doing a course like this, you could just as easily get by with a $20 book (probably this one). That\u2019s what I did, at least. I\u2019m 100% sure there\u2019s stuff I\u2019m missing from my process, different from the course, and that\u2019s the point. It\u2019s my process. It works for me. Nobody can show you yours.\nAnyway! Onto the scrapbook of treatises on notes that I enjoyed:\nMaybe\u2026 Notes Don\u2019t Have to Be Useful\nLawrence Yeo writes:\nIf I\u2019m reading something great, I\u2019m immersed in the idea or narrative that is being communicated. I feel like I\u2019m there alongside the author, completely present with the words on the page.\nBut let\u2019s say I come across a sentence or two that I want to save for later. When I make the motion to highlight it, I break myself out of the present and pivot my mind to the future. I think about how this can be useful, and how I can incorporate it into the goals and priorities I\u2019ve set for myself. This is very subtle, but that\u2019s what\u2019s happening.\nIn the same way that recording the present moment diminishes presence, capturing a flow of information diminishes resonance. A person with thousands of notes views information primarily for its utility, and not for how it moved them when they first came across it.\nI experienced some version of this while watching jeen-yuhs. On one hand, I just wanted to enjoy the documentary at the end of a long day. On the other \u2014 should I be marking time stamps so that I could actually respond to things, elaborate on it, rewind, etc.?\nIt\u2019s an entirely different experience. I ended up just watching the whole thing, stopping only to go to the bathroom, and I loved it. I watched it again and started marking times.\nMy only response to Yeo\u2019s is his assumption that notes are mainly for usefulness. Most of the time I am somewhat a transactional reader \u2014 I want to get things out of my books \u2014 but I read for fun too. I don\u2019t take notes only on topics that I think will be useful, and I often miss taking notes on things that are.\nI take notes on things that are interesting, on phrasing that I like, on all sorts of things that stand out to me. Sometimes I just write, \u201cLol!\u201d I\u2019m responding to the author, I\u2019m collecting, and I often just highlight things that stand out. That\u2019s literally a part of my reading process, and it\u2019s like having a conversation with the author.\nI appreciate the digital gardening concept because that\u2019s how I see it too. Gardeners don\u2019t always just plant plants because they want to eat them; they plant them to admire them, to try something new, to see what happens. That\u2019s a much closer attitude to how I think about note taking.\nNotes Need to Be Constrained\nJosh Duffney writes in, \u201c\u200b\u200bNote-taking became a full-time job, so I stopped\u201d:\nMy biggest mistake wasn\u2019t taking so many notes, but not leaving enough room for my own creative process to mold the workflow. It\u2019s not about taking notes on everything but taking better notes, organizing them in a way that makes sense, AND in a way that improves your thinking, learning, writing, etc\u2026\nI can totally relate and see this happening. I\u2019ve started putting together my own methods for \u201ccollecting\u201d interesting bits and pieces around the internet, and letting it sit down. I only take permanent notes on things that interest me after some time has passed. I must also add that, contrary to the headline, Josh did not stop taking notes.\nKeep Your Notes Simple\nSasha Chapin brings up a lot of fascinating points in \u201cNotes Against Note-Taking Systems.\u201d First!\nI am waiting for any evidence that our most provocative thinkers and writers are those who rely on elaborate, systematic note-taking systems. I am seeing evidence that people taught knowledge management for its own sake produce unexciting work. This is not a genetic condition. I think they could do better if they wrote what they knew, rather than what they recorded.\nTo the first point, the obvious outstanding counter-examples would be Robert Greene and Ryan Holiday. The latter has written about this; while notes are a part of his process, it\u2019s just as important to live an interesting life. I can\u2019t really bring myself to read anyone who only takes notes and only writes about taking notes.\nIt\u2019s unfortunate \u2014 and perhaps telling! \u2014 that Niklas Luhmann\u2019s legacy seems to be best-known for his note-taking system, not for his actual work in sociology. (That could very well be intentional \u2014 is it really likely that sociology would break through to mainstream decades later?) But I don\u2019t think he\u2019d be better served not taking notes at all.\nFor example, Kanye West has (had?) a pretty comprehensive vinyl collection to sample from, but we don\u2019t talk about it \u2014 the rest of his work is far more interesting.\nThe other thought here is, I also know plenty of poor thinkers and writers who do not rely on elaborate, systematic, note-taking systems. Which leads me to agree with Chapin, notes or no notes, there\u2019s something deeper that drives the creative process here.\nI believe controlled sloppiness is the key. I like writing every day, even if the blog post starts with a note, because it forces me to actually relate to the note. To make sense, to connect dots, to leave a bit of myself with it.\nSometimes, I don\u2019t have a note, and I just actually write about my life. It\u2019s sloppy and chaotic, in contrast to the controlled rigor of my note-taking. I have a hunch this\u2019ll all make sense one day, and I\u2019m working towards it.\nIt\u2019s not that I advocate for no note-taking. I just strongly believe in keeping it as elementary as possible, such that the note-taking itself doesn\u2019t become the thrust of the endeavor. Leonardo da Vinci kept all of his notes in one big book. If he liked something he put it down. This is known as a commonplace book, and it is about how detailed your note-taking system should be unless you plan on thinking more elaborately than Leonardo da Vinci. Taping a bunch of cryptic phrases to the walls is also acceptable, or keeping a shoebox full of striking phrases on a jumble of papers, as Eminem did.\nI couldn\u2019t agree more with this. I only take notes because I need to; I used to try to write them down once a day, I don\u2019t really have any preset rules or quotas or things like that anymore. I still use index cards, for goodness sakes. (I almost ran out recently, and it felt awful \u2014 like I was running out of toilet paper.)\nJust Write, Dammit\nMax Nussenbaum:\nMy own note-taking \u201csystem\u201d is extremely minimal and stupid. It consists of roughly 2,000 completely unorganized entries in my iPhone notes app, stretching back thirteen years. These could be, among other things: an interesting fact I learned, an idea for an essay, something funny one of my friends said, a dream I had, a shopping list from 2011, or a weird name I made up.\u2026 These notes are not organized in any way. Everything from earlier than, say, the past six months is effectively lost to history, except in the rare occasions where I randomly scroll through the entire list for inspiration or out of boredom.\nLove this, it works for him, I can totally relate. I didn\u2019t take any notes when I was writing this blog post (it would\u2019ve felt weird, besides I just need to write my blog post for the day and I\u2019ve been itching to write this one!).\nMy \u201cnotes\u201d are stupid messy too \u2014 some are in Notion and my zettelkasten, a lot are in a Google Doc where I collect things copying and pasting the old fashioned way (because I never end up reading articles I save in Pocket), and a lot of is spread out around the internet and at this blog (before I had set up my zettelkasten).\nMy number one piece of writing advice \u2014 really, my only piece of writing advice \u2014 is that basically everything that isn\u2019t writing, revising, or editing is a waste of time. This is especially true for beginners, who are prone to procrastination in the guise of planning. At least once a week someone asks me if they should publish on Substack or WordPress, which is basically the platform equivalent of asking if they should write in Garamond or Times New Roman. Taking elaborate notes on what you read is even worse, since it\u2019s busywork that disguises itself as productivity. How many people are out there convinced they\u2019ve taken the first step towards being an insightful blogger or essayist, when really all they have is a folder full of a bunch of other people\u2019s ideas?\nMusic to my ears, I don\u2019t really have much to add other than it was a joyful experience to signal boost all of these excerpts.\nNothing should ever take precedence over writing and doing the actual work.\nIf you enjoyed this article, you\u2019ll love my upcoming book, Creative Doing.

A day after the 100 Day Project started, I decided to try to write every day. When I\u2019m busy, it just takes a couple of minutes and I basically write about something interesting I\u2019ve found \u2014 usually in my zettelkasten, or in a big Google Doc I\u2019ve recently started collecting the best fragments of what I\u2019ve read. (It\u2019s already 80+ pages, so I\u2019ll need to figure out a better way to manage this.) If you want to learn how to write every day, here\u2019s what my process looks like, as sequentially as I can get.\nEvery blog post starts with an idea, an emotion, or a response:\nI never run out of ideas because I collect them all in an editorial calendar in Airtable. I also collect interesting bits from the internet in Google Docs (the best of which make it into my zettelkasten, but those permanent notes take too long to handwrite as well). I\u2019ve been itching to switch to TiddlyWiki or something because this Google Doc is getting very unruly.\nMy ideas are all focused on things that I find interesting, sometimes I\u2019ve talked about it with friends, other times I just figure I\u2019ll just put it out there and see if readers like it.\nActually I get a lot of good ideas when I wash the dishes and I\u2019m not listening to any music or podcasts, random memories and examples collide together in my brain. Same with going on walks, etc. When this happens I do my best to write it down asap, in the aforementioned Google Doc.\nWhen a writer at the New York Times asked master choregrapher and author Twyla Tharp how she made time to read in her very busy schedule, she responded, \u201c\u2019I hack it out of the marble of the day.\u201d Time is similarly the greatest constraint on my writing, and I hack mine out of my own calendar as well \u2014 in between chores, first thing in the morning if I woke up early, last thing before bed sometimes:\nIf I have very little time \u2014 like two minutes \u2014 the blog post will be not much more than an excerpt and a headline, maybe a couple of lines that says, \u201cHey, here\u2019s what I found interesting and here\u2019s why.\u201d (Like this one on positioning.)\nIf I have a moderate amount of time \u2014 like 15 minutes \u2014 I\u2019ll just write the headline as \u201c5 Sentences on\u2026 XYZ topic\u201d and try to find 5 things I want to say to illustrate the point I want to make. (And often figure out what that point is.) That\u2019s actually how this post started. This was actually a great structure for me, because I\u2019m forced to focus and find the point I want to make. I also come up with a ton of other ideas in the process \u2014 \u201cOh, this is interesting, not quite what I want to say though.\u201d\nI also realized that even outside of my blog, I already write a lot \u2014 like, in emails to friends, taking notes, and such. I often can just copy and paste ideas, and add an introduction and transitions, to make a post I\u2019m happy with. (For example, this blog post started as an email. And actually this one you\u2019re reading right now started as two comments in a separate community.)\nIf I have more time, like 30\u201360 minutes, I\u2019ll write up a longer piece or turn a short piece into a longer one.\nThat\u2019s how I decide which structure to use. I don\u2019t really follow conventional clickbait headline writing advice at my personal blog, I\u2019m thinking I\u2019ll probably spend more time headlining here at Medium. I like the headlines I write at my blog though.\nI usually start and finish a post in one session, which is really different from my process for writing other pieces and my previous processes \u2014 I used to edit posts three times, once by hand, before I released them.\nYou\u2019ll notice that none of this actually helps me get my articles read, which would be fine if I were writing purely as a hobbyist. However, I\u2019m not satisfied with that \u2014 if I\u2019m writing, I want to get read! Even from a pure business perspective, I want to build my mailing list so I can sell the books I write. I also want to write books that I know will be useful for people, which requires testing ideas out. So here\u2019s a (very undisciplined and simple) promotional process:\nSometimes, after getting the post scheduled in WordPress, I turn them into threads for Twitter. (I use Hypefury). This works best with my five sentence posts (which are already short enough). One of them recently went viral (here\u2019s the original). Each thread I write starts off as a blog post.\nEach week, I\u2019ll take a couple of hours to re-work some of these pieces to be at a place where Fast Company might be interested in picking them up.\nOccasionally \u2014 and I have no set times here \u2014 I go back and find keywords that people are searching in Google and seeing if my blog posts can make a good fit \u2014 or if I can re-assemble them into a new post that fits.\nI used to republish my posts at Medium, and I plan on having an assistant support me with that.\nSame goes for LinkedIn.\nWriting daily can get stressful, so I\u2019ve built up a queue so the deadline pressure isn\u2019t too high. My blog is also now a starting point for ideas, not an endpoint \u2014 so I\u2019m not too concerned about how perfect an article is. I\u2019m having a lot of fun with it, which was the main goal!\nI didn\u2019t realize I had so many ideas I found interesting, and writing each one out generates more. Enjoying the chaos of it all, which naturally means struggling with structure and focus at some moments.\nI\u2019m really enjoying the shift in process, because ideas used to be stuck in my head. I couldn\u2019t share them with people outside of doing a call. This process fits in way more with my philosophy of Creative Doing; the ideas are far from perfect, but in writing them and having other people read them, I can refine them and improve them. I can also see what resonates and what\u2019s not.\nWith this process, I know that I\u2019m not going to be intentionally doing my cleanest or most concise writing; that\u2019s okay, perfection will emerge from this large volume I\u2019m making. And more importantly, I\u2019m personally getting a lot of momentum, energy, and insights from the process \u2014 which makes me happier (\u201cadds to my quality of life\u201d lol), gets me thinking, and makes me better in my personal and professional lives.\nIf you\u2019re interested in writing more, reading more is a good place to start. So is learning to think less and do more!\nIf you enjoyed this article, you\u2019ll love my upcoming book, Creative Doing.

Most of the time, I didn\u2019t even hear about the opportunities or appreciate how important they were and how much they could change my life, so I didn\u2019t develop my senses for it. The ones I did hear about, I\u2019d learn more and immediately disqualify myself. I felt blocked by it. It\u2019s almost like I heard a voice in my head, saying things like:\nWho did I think I was, to apply for these opportunities? Why should I be so special? I\u2019m just some kid.\nIt\u2019s too late. Other people have a leg up and I discovered this opportunity too late, I\u2019m going to get rejected. So why waste time?\nMy portfolio is trash compared to all of these other people. They are so good at what they do and I\u2019m just some hack.\nLooking back, none of these points were actually true, so there\u2019s a sense of regret. I missed out on an enriched arts program (I could\u2019ve developed my skills as a cartoonist!), a media program (too much commitment and ate too many credits!), journalism school (I\u2019d probably be doing the same thing I\u2019m doing now!), scholarships, and an enriched business school (I didn\u2019t think they\u2019d care about my application!), amongst many many many other things. It was a mental form of repression; I was holding myself back.\nA small consolation: I love what I\u2019m doing now, and there\u2019s a really good chance that I\u2019d probably be doing exactly the same thing. But damn, if I improved my drawing skills, that would only add to my skill set and enrich what I\u2019m doing now by a mile.\nThere\u2019s a common thread in a lot of interviews with people who have experienced some success: at some point, they faked it. For me, in my second-year summer, I was doing an internship and wanted to learn how to code. My friend, upon hearing this, told his uncle who approached me to see if I could build a new website for his business. I asked him how much he would pay, he said a few thousand bucks, and I never called him after that. The money and commitment scared me off \u2014 I barely knew how to style my own WordPress website!\nOf course, looking back, I realized that that was already enough. I\u2019d have something that I\u2019d be able to show him. And he wasn\u2019t dumb either, he knew he was hiring a college kid, and a website should cost way more than a few thousand bucks \u2014 but I didn\u2019t trust him, I thought my friend and I had fooled him somehow. So I missed out on a chance to save him a ton of money, gain myself some valuable experience, and prove myself wrong about myself.\nThat was one of the last times I would miss an opportunity like that. I\u2019m lucky that in college \u2014 I did go to a business school \u2014 one of the things I learned from peers and from applying to jobs was not to hold back anymore. Just go until you get the offer. You don\u2019t get to decide whether you want it or not until then; just do it. You are free to quit the offer, and to quit the job, and to drop those things after you get it, but if you want it you need to go for it.\nWe\u2019d call these Lamborghini problems; entrepreneurs were so busy figuring out what color they wanted their Lamborghini to be that they were not spending time focusing on their business and actually getting it. I\u2019m not much of a sports car enthusiast, but that really resonated \u2014 don\u2019t count your chickens before they hatch.\nThe lesson here is: Don\u2019t get in your own way. Just try your best at that moment and sometimes it\u2019ll be more than enough. You are more than enough. I am more than enough.\nLucky for me, along with the new insights I got in school, paradigms shifted, and institutional powers are fading. Instead, it\u2019s cool to be able to do it yourself now. Almost everything I do now, I started off by myself, without institutional support \u2014 though I do think I\u2019d be further with education and networking benefits that came from institutions. Like Derek Sivers writes in Your Music and People, it\u2019s best to make two plans: one that relies on nobody else, and one that relies heavily on everybody else.\nMy first plan is to work in technology and write. My second plan is to work with publishers. I\u2019m working on both at the same time.

During those seconds, the world existed entirely in my mind. In that instant of suspended reality, before unconsciousness faded to awareness, I could forget she had died. It was a weightless, fleeting half-drawn breath of a second that offered up a shred of relief.\nI lived each day anticipating this singular moment, crawling into bed far too early each evening so that I could travel closer to that sliver of time when she was still, impossibly, alive. Then, when the full light of morning hit me, I remembered she was gone, and I felt like she had died all over again.\nThat was year one.\nAt some point during the second year, this hairline crack of solace vanished, like a fragile dream that fades with waking. A different kind of grief gripped me after that. It was a grief anchored in reality that started in October when the world ached with color. I knew all that abundance would be gone soon. By mid-November, the leaves would be brown and the trees bare. For the first time in my life, I felt the entire length of winter. It wrecked me.\nMy daughter, Ana, in her last school photo at age 15. Photo: Juliet Lofaro\nThis new flavor of grief thwarted my attempts to connect with Ana\u2019s spirit. Hopelessness has been my dominant emotion this past year, punctuated by the realization that Ana is gone forever. With her loss, my years as a mother and my most joyful decade have passed.\nThis was year two.\nI\u2019ve learned that you can yearn for something so hard that it physically hurts. You can miss someone so desperately that it makes you wish daily for a different ending. And so I wished\u2014and I still wish\u2014that it was me who got the cancer. I wished that it was me who had to say goodbye to life, that I had suffered with the intractable pain of a dying body instead of my sweet girl, my Ana.\nI\u2019ve spent these winter months fighting off a desolation so profound and unmovable, I marvel that I can get out of bed at all some days. But I do get out of bed. I must get out of bed.\nIt\u2019s with a heavy heart and no small amount of relief that I say goodbye to the second year of grief and enter year three without Ana. As I approach March 22, the anniversary of her death, I\u2019m already noticing a new change to the shape of my grief.\nShe feels so far away.\nThe first year of grief was akin to a moon landing. I found myself in alien territory, numb and adrift.\nThe second year has been consumed by the slow, painful realization that I am never going home. It\u2019s lonely up here on the moon with no light or air or color. But we do have the most dazzling view of Earth.\nAs the final month of the second year draws to a close, I\u2019m trying to navigate two opposing realities: I\u2019m the mother of a child who is no longer here. But she can\u2019t be gone because I still feel her in every cell of my body.\nYear two is reality. It\u2019s waking up every day without the fleeting, desperate thought that maybe this was all a big mistake. It\u2019s getting used to the way the house sounds with only three of us inside its walls.\nYear two is forgetting the little things about her face that I\u2019d once had memorized, like her crooked tooth, the arch of her eyebrows, and her smell.\nBy the end of year two, I\u2019d stopped telling Ana\u2019s story to every person I met. When it came up\u2014if it came up\u2014I\u2019d simply say, \u201cShe would\u2019ve been 17,\u201d or \u201cI lost my daughter.\u201d\nAt first it seemed important to recap the nearly five years we spent trying to keep Ana alive. They overshadowed everything that came before them. My husband, younger daughter, and I were traumatized by that reality but retelling it feels like I\u2019m holding on to that trauma.\nThose were the final years of Ana\u2019s life and not talking about them makes me feel like I\u2019m losing her all over again. But, if I\u2019m being honest, there are dozens of moments each day that make me feel like I\u2019m losing her all over again.\nI don\u2019t know how to release the trauma of watching Ana die without feeling like I\u2019m also losing my sharpest memories of her. I thought I wanted to remember every single thing about her, but maybe year three is about letting myself forget some things.\nIf she hadn\u2019t died, I wouldn\u2019t be hanging on to all of these memories so tightly. I don\u2019t do that with my younger daughter. There are joyful memories buried beneath the sorrow, and I know I need to unearth them. I want to unearth them.\nI suspect this is what year three will look like.\nAna loved folding paper cranes. I wrote about this as she was dying and again on the first anniversary of her death.\nWe folded cranes last March and left them everywhere we could with the hashtag #CranesForAna written on their wings. With the help of Ana\u2019s friends, the cranes flew far and wide.\nAna\u2019s cranes bring me joy. The memory of her folding them offers solace in place of pain. It\u2019s a memory worth carrying with me into year three.\nThe Japanese believe that if you fold 1,000 origami cranes, your wish will come true. Ana didn\u2019t know this. She just loved to fold cranes and give them to people, especially me. I wish I could tell her about this tradition.\nLast year, I learned how to fold my first crane. It\u2019s calming and meditative. It allows me to think of her with every crease I make in the paper, a gift from Ana that I hadn\u2019t anticipated. I am so grateful for that gift.\nIf I fold a thousand cranes, my wish won\u2019t come true. That\u2019s the reality that year two hammered home. Yet, with each crane I fold, I feel Ana close by. I am reminded of the joy of Ana\u2019s life, not the sorrow. It is almost\u2014but not quite\u2014like the hair\u2019s breadth of a moment that I experienced each morning during year one, before I remembered that Ana was gone.\nA collection of paper cranes I folded on the first anniversary of Ana\u2019s death. Photo: Jacqueline Dooley\nOn March 22, 2019, the second anniversary of Ana\u2019s death, I invite you to fold a crane with me. Here is the tutorial that taught me how to fold my first crane. When you\u2019re done, write #CranesForAna on its wings and leave it somewhere for a stranger to find. This grief is heavy but when people share in remembering Ana\u2019s life, it\u2019s a little easier to bear.\nThis year\u2019s cranes.

The retail giant has been efficiently mining my shopping addiction ever since. That\u2019s longer than I\u2019ve been married. In fact, my very first purchase on Amazon was a book about planning a wedding, an order I placed on October 23, 1997.\nOver the past two decades, Amazon has molded me into the perfect customer, luring me with fast and free shipping, an endless selection of goods, and a seamlessly smooth shopping experience. They have effectively divided my shopping addiction into five simple and satisfying steps \u2014 ideate, click, buy, receive, repeat \u2014 over and over again, for more than two decades.\nMy desire to curb my robotic habit of buying whatever pops into my head is the biggest reason I didn\u2019t renew my Prime membership.\nBut it\u2019s so much more than that. I\u2019m tired of Amazon. I\u2019m sick of seeing their branded vans roaming my neighborhood. I\u2019m chilled by the sheer number of Amazon boxes smiling up at me from porches, storefronts, and the backs of those damn ubiquitous vans.\nI am thoroughly sick of Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s poster child and its billionaire founder.\nSo, yes, while there is a tangible cost to Prime membership that I could reasonably cite as my reason for quitting, there\u2019s also an intangible cost to paying for Prime. Dropping Prime is a tiny act of defiance. For me, continuing to pay for the service is like casting a vote in favor of Amazon and against communities, the planet, Amazon\u2019s own workers, and small businesses.\nI quit Prime after fifteen years of dedicated membership because I no longer want to feed a machine that hurts so many people.\nMy decision to stop paying for Prime ultimately begins and ends with Jeff Bezos, a man whose experiment with digitizing consumerism has compelled me to scratch my itch to shop over and over again.\nBezos made a bet that he could create a store that sold everything. He predicted, back in the late 1990s, that one day anything anyone wanted could appear on their doorstep like magic. He won that bet, and now he\u2019s the second richest person in the world. Good for him!\nAmong his many possessions are a 417-foot mega yacht, a 14-acre compound in Hawaii, a 27,000 square foot D.C. Estate, and a huge mechanical clock \u2014 50 stories high \u2014 that cost him $42 million (so far) to build. The clock will supposedly tell time for the next 10,000 years, and is meant to get us thinking about the future of humanity. There\u2019s more, of course. These are just a few examples of what our unfettered devotion to Amazon pays for.\nAccording to the PBS documentary, Amazon Empire: The Rise and Reign of Jeff Bezos, Amazon was never the end goal for Bezos. Rather, the company serves as a funding mechanism for his true vision \u2014 space colonization.\nBezos spends about $1 billion dollars of Amazon stock each year to fund Blue Origin, his space exploration company. By the time Bezos made his first successful launch into space, in July 2021, he\u2019d spent roughly $5.5 billion of his own money for the 11-minute flight.\nMy understanding of this vision might be skewed by incredulous rage, but it seems Bezos (and, thus, Amazon) views the Earth as a resource to be mined for the noble goal of creating floating space habitats which will sustain future generations of humans.\nThis apparently validates the short-term devastation that Amazon is creating. That is, it\u2019s okay to ruin our one and only planet because the space habitats will replicate the best of what Earth once had to offer \u2014 beaches, forests, perfect weather, and endless luxury. I wish I was kidding.\nAccording to Bezos, if I can\u2019t imagine a future of unlimited growth for humanity \u2014 realized from within a collection of climate-controlled pods floating in space \u2014 then I\u2019m not thinking big enough.\nBezos\u2019s vision for the future may seem noble when viewed through the lens of \u201cprogress for humanity.\u201d But from where I\u2019m sitting, it kind of seems like Bezos is the Once-ler from Dr. Seuss\u2019s The Lorax, cutting down Truffula trees to sell on Amazon so he can fund his dubious vision of space colonization.\nPrime has been instrumental in helping Amazon thrive, not just because it\u2019s another $35 billion of annual revenue (or so) that goes into the Amazon coffers, but because Prime members buy often and spend more. A recent survey of U.S. shoppers by Bank of America revealed that Prime members spend an average of $1968 per year. That\u2019s four times more than non-Prime members.\nAmazon reached 200 million Prime members last April. They made record profits during the pandemic. Subscribers, myself included, tend to search for products first on Amazon, at twice the rate of non-prime members. And why not? We all want to squeeze as much value as possible from the cost of membership.\nIt\u2019s not just the e-commerce offering that makes Amazon so successful. Amazon dominates the cloud computing space, with Amazon Web Services (AWS) supporting nearly half of the internet\u2019s infrastructure in 2022.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, AWS made just under $18 billion in revenue, up 40% over the previous year. In that same quarter, Amazon earned nearly $10 billion from advertising services, a number predicted to reach over $31 billion by 2023.\nThis still pales in comparison to Amazon\u2019s retail revenue. Amazon\u2019s net retail sales increased to just under $470 billion in 2021, up 22% from $386 billion in 2020.\nJust like its founder, Amazon is relentless. But there\u2019s a flaw in its business model that\u2019s beginning to put a strain on the company\u2019s customer-driven approach to retail. It seems that people aren\u2019t a limitless commodity.\nWhile it\u2019s true that a heavily automated picking, packing, and shipping process makes it possible for Amazon to churn out millions of packages, the company relies on mere mortals to get stuff out the door. Bezos didn\u2019t extend his long-term vision of space exploration to these workers because to him, like everything else on planet Earth, people are a means to an end.\nAlthough Bezos stepped down as CEO last July, Amazon continues to embrace a dystopian corporate vision of working people to the point of burnout (or worse) for\u2026I don\u2019t know. The betterment of humanity?\nThe early vision was all about being relentless \u2014 in scale, in growth, and in e-commerce domination. In fact, Relentless.com is what Bezos originally wanted to call Amazon. Go ahead and type \u201cRelentless.com\u201d into your browser and see where you end up.\nThat spirit of relentlessness might be what motivated Amazon to roll out unlimited 1-day shipping to Prime members back in April 2019. No one was asking for it, as far as I know. But one must make sacrifices in the name of progress. If you\u2019re Amazon, that means getting packages in hands even quicker, regardless of the toll it\u2019s taking on your employees.\nFree 1-day shipping on even small incidental purchases meant more delivery drivers falling asleep with potentially lethal consequences. It meant even more injuries for overworked warehouse workers. It meant an absolute shit-ton of waste, with Amazon generating more than 465 million pounds of plastic waste in 2019. When it comes to putting profit first and people last, Amazon certainly is relentless.\nI made the decision to drop Amazon Prime two years ago because I didn\u2019t like the shopper I\u2019d become. After 15 years as a Prime member, I realized that I didn\u2019t want the best deal. I didn\u2019t care about 2-day shipping. I didn\u2019t need an unlimited selection. Amazon had become a hollow promise \u2014 a company that caused more harm than good.\nBut Covid-19 sidelined my grand plans of canceling Prime. In the early months of the pandemic, most of us were afraid to touch our groceries, much less go to stores. Instead of quitting Prime and reducing my spending on Amazon, I went all in. Amazon, my oldest and most faithful retail friend, was there to deliver.\nThat year, I placed a total of 83 orders on the retail megasite. I turned to Amazon again and again because it was easy, it was fast, it was cheap, and I had Prime.\nI\u2019m not proud of my 2020 Amazon buying blitz. I pulled it back somewhat in 2021, placing 53 orders, mostly in the first half of the year. Yet even as Amazon benefited from the pandemic, their bad behavior continued.\nThey were thwarting unions. They were shortchanging new parents and vulnerable employees on medical leave. They were continuing to put warehouse workers in life-threatening jeopardy. They were filling our oceans with plastic.\nMeanwhile, Jeff Bezos launched himself into space for 11 minutes, farting into the atmosphere at a time when climate change caused record-breaking heat waves, floods, wildfires, storms, and drought.\nBy the end of the year, I was again ready to cut the virtual cord, and cut it I did. April 1st, 2022 was my last day as an Amazon Prime member. I\u2019m looking forward to finding alternatives to Amazon, to buying less, and to being more human than consumer.\nBezos thinks space colonization is the only way future generations can unleash their potential for creativity and growth. He\u2019s using Amazon to try to make this delusion a reality.\nIn the fevered gaze of a billionaire\u2019s vision, planet Earth \u2014 and the people who live here \u2014 don\u2019t matter.\nWhat if Bezos took all his money and energy and tried to solve the real problems we\u2019re facing today? What if he and Amazon paid their fair share in taxes, because government programs to reduce emissions, educate citizens, and keep people healthy are the building blocks for a sustainable future?\nThe problems we face today are huge. They seem impossible. And yet, it might still be possible to create a world that we can be proud of when that giant clock chimes in 10,000 years.\nTo save the Earth, we must rip our eyes away from the stars \u2014 and the promise of free 1-day shipping \u2014 and focus on the ground. Together, we can be a force, if only we stopped clicking the Buy button. Imagine what those 200 million Prime subscriptions could do to change the world?\nI know that losing my $139 annual Prime membership fee won\u2019t hurt Amazon. It\u2019s a tiny drop in the enormous bucket of the company\u2019s total revenue. But in the words of Jeff Bezos, \u201cBig things start small.\u201d\n\u2014\nThank you for reading my work.

I wonder if the neighbors notice their chatter.\nGrief whispers, \u201cNo one likes the birds but you.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d I tell her, but it\u2019s a lie.\nShe starts to speak, but a Northern Cardinal\u2019s undulating song cuts her off.\nI look up at the necatarine tree, bereft of leaves on this chill April morning. \u201cThank you,\u201d I say, searching for his bright red feathers. He bows his scarlet head in my direction.\nGrief remains silent as I replenish the feeders, but not before shaking her fist at a dole of Mourning Doves gathered on the ground. They retreat to the trees, an explosion of white and grey feathers, cooing their alarm.\nI watch the doves leave as Grief lingers close. \u201cThey\u2019ll be back,\u201d I say.\nThe Goldfinches begin to congregate on the thistle feeder, a dozen of males with mottled yellow and brown feathers and soft gold-grey females that look like tiny clouds. Grief vanishes for a few weightless seconds as I watch them.\nWhen this chore is done, I sit down to work. Grief sits beside me and whispers about longing and loneliness.\n\u201cHow can you work when your daughter\u2019s gone?\u201d she asks and I wonder the same thing. She transforms into a cloud, wraps her body around me, and rolls along the spine of my sadness until, weeping, I give up on work.\nA flash of movement from my office window breaks her hold. The doves are back. They gather beneath the feeders like chickens, tiny heads bobbing.\nThere are House Finches and White-throated Sparrows among them, each bird intent on the singular goal of filling their bellies with seed. I wipe the tears from my face and feel her stiffen with frustration, but before she can pull me back into despair, I see a flash of red among the grey sea of doves.\n\u201cCardinal,\u201d I whisper, smiling.\nShe curses and retreats. \u201cNot for long.\u201d\nShe runs outside, changing shape as her feet hit the sodden lawn, becoming a lithe marmalade tomcat. The scarlet bird, busy at the feeder, is oblivious.\n\u201cNo!\u201d I run outside, clapping my hands to scatter the birds.\n\u201cI\u2019ll get one eventually,\u201d Grief says. Her eyes are bright, expectant. I turn away from her, pretend I don\u2019t care, but my heart feels heavy.\nThe blackbirds and starlings arrive as the daylight fades, filling the trees. Their chatter sounds like rain. When the light fades, they flock, their dark bodies casting speckled shadows against the purpling sky. I watch, transfixed, wondering what it\u2019s like to perch among the trees. I wish I could grow wings. I am staring at them when she comes.\n\u201cThey\u2019re ugly, aren\u2019t they?\u201d Grief asks, her brow creased with worry. \u201cDo you think they\u2019ll chase all the good birds away? What if they damage your house?\u201d\n\u201cThey do that?\u201d I ask, knowing I shouldn\u2019t engage. Panic rises from my stomach to my throat. I\u2019ll have to take the feeders down!\n\u201cYes,\u201d she says and shakes her head. \u201cIt\u2019s the only solution.\u201d\n\u201cBut then I won\u2019t have the birds.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have me,\u201d Grief says, touching my arm. She watches me fight my sadness until I let the tears flow, salty and cold. With a satisfied sigh, she wraps her arms around me as I stand in the driveway, desolate, the birds forgotten.\nThe sweet trill of a White-throated Sparrow breaks her hold. I step back.\n\u201cI\u2019ll always have you,\u201d I say. \u201cWith or without the birds. Can you watch them with me?\u201d\nShe looks uncertain. \u201cBut you\u2019re crazy to love them \u2014 a crazy bird lady.

It was as if someone had flipped a switch. All the smells had simply vanished from the world.\nSlightly desperate, I put candles and spices and bars of soap right up against my nose \u2014 all to no avail. I spent a surreal 10 minutes cleaning the cat box in a complete olfactory void.\nAn odorless world was profoundly disorienting, but the feeling of surreal otherness was not unfamiliar.\nIt reminded me of how I\u2019d felt the year my daughter died. I\u2019d walked around in a cloud of deep grief, completely disconnected from everyone and everything.\nIn those first few awful months, I\u2019d only wanted one thing \u2014 to remain close to Ana even in death. I let the living world fade into the background as I held onto every tangible piece of my child. I could see the trees, the blue sky, the mail truck coming and going, but I couldn\u2019t feel any of it. I was numb.\nBack then, I couldn\u2019t imagine the numbness ever leaving. Truthfully, I didn\u2019t really want it to. It was a shield keeping me from feeling the full horror of my loss. But gradually life began to return, bit by painful bit.\nAs months and then years passed, I allowed some of life\u2019s vibrance to return in small ways \u2014 in warm spring days and steaming cups of coffee. In the comforting weight of my camera pointed at a migrating warbler. In the slow kindling of new friendships. In the miracle of my younger daughter\u2019s artwork and her laughter and her relentless desire to understand the world.\nAfter five years, I know a lot more about grief than I did in those first, stumbling months, but I also know how little I know. Grief\u2019s intensity and its ever-present demands still surprise me.\nI don\u2019t know what I\u2019d expected my grief would become five years ago when I was at the very beginning,\u00a0still\u00a0so\u00a0close\u00a0to\u00a0Ana\u00a0that\u00a0she\u00a0glowed\u00a0in\u00a0stark\u00a0relief\u00a0in\u00a0my\u00a0mind\u2019s\u00a0eye.\nFive stages, I guess. A neat row of steps laid out in front of me \u2014 denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and (absurdly) acceptance.\nWhat a load of crap.\nI\u2019d hoped I\u2019d find purpose by now. I\u2019d hoped I\u2019d realize some measure of peace. I\u2019d hoped I\u2019d be able to dwell only on the good memories of Ana and how she\u2019d brought joy to our family.\nI\u2019d hoped that I\u2019d have a solid relationship with her spirit, a \u201ccontinuing bond\u201d\u200athat made her feel close.\nBut I didn\u2019t fully grasp the permanence of her absence or how the endless chasm of time would be so relentless. I wasn\u2019t prepared for how much I\u00a0would\u00a0change. Would she even know me now?\nImagine a year without seeing your child. Now stretch that year into forever.\nI couldn\u2019t have known what five years meant back then.\nI couldn\u2019t have known that my love would try to follow her forever, always seeking and never finding. My love for Ana is lost with her, somewhere out there in the dark. After five years, I\u2019m still trying to find my way to something like acceptance.\nWhen I woke up to a world devoid of odor, I\u2019d panicked. I couldn\u2019t smell Ana\u2019s favorite perfume oil or the champa incense we both loved.\nI couldn\u2019t smell the candles I\u2019ve been burning all winter, the ones with hints of amber resin and sandalwood and vanilla. Smells she\u2019d loved. Smells that reminded me of her physical body.\nSitting in my office, staring helplessly at a steaming cup of odorless coffee, I was utterly bereft. Would I ever smell anything again? Would I eventually forget the smell of coffee and of Ana\u2019s precious perfume oil?\nIn that moment, the weight of years felt like it was crushing me. It had seemed unfathomable how long it had been since I\u2019d heard her voice, touched her face, or smelled her hair. Even the most vivid memories were disintegrating into the abyss of my unreliable mind.\nI remember that she\u2019d fallen on that last day and that I\u2019d practically carried her back to bed.\nThe heaviness of her body had surprised me as had her complete lack of strength. She\u2019d been so thin\u200a\u2014\u200abarely there at all.\nI don\u2019t like this memory of Ana, but it\u2019s one of the last times I touched her when she was alive and so in that blank scentless moment, I let myself dwell on how the weight of her felt in my arms.\nIt\u2019s no wonder that I felt such wild-eyed hysteria at the sudden absence of smell when I brought that bottle of oil to my nose. It had been a sharp, merciless reminder that I can no longer recall with visceral clarity, the memory of my own child.\nAna in January 2014, age 12. Photo: Author\n\u201cKillian would be 29 this year!\u201d My friend Babs texted our group chat a couple of days into my journey with anosmia, the clinical word for a complete loss of smell.\nKillian was Babs\u2019 son. He\u2019d died from cancer when he was 16. Now, nearly 13 years later, Babs was one of my best friends. I hadn\u2019t known her when Killian was sick. I\u2019d met her seven years after he died around the time when Ana\u2019s cancer had pivoted from stable to terminal.\nBabs had helped me navigate the last few months of Ana\u2019s life. By some miracle, we\u2019ve remained friends ever since. She is far ahead of me on this lifelong journey of parental grief.\nI want to ask Babs what it\u2019s like after 10 years have passed, but I\u2019m afraid of what she might say. It\u2019s enough to see that she\u2019s survived over a decade without Killian. It\u2019s enough to hear her laugh. It\u2019s enough to witness her endless pride and love for her daughter Cally, who was just nine years old when her big brother died.\nIt\u2019s enough, for now, to hope for an eventual peace \u2014 if not acceptance \u2014 in the midst of my bottomless grief.\nOn the first anniversary of Ana\u2019s death, I wanted the world to stop and remember her with me. I learned how to fold paper cranes that year. It was something that Ana had been able to do that I could not, a source of pride for her.\nShe would gift me cranes and I would collect them happily.\n\u201cAna, this one is my favorite,\u201d I would say about each carefully folded crane. \u201cCan I have another?\u201d\nFolded cranes decorated Ana\u2019s memorial and folded cranes kept me connected to her in those first terrible years without her. Cranes were also a way for me to pull people back into Ana\u2019s world, a way for them to recall the reality of her.\nBut time dulls senses. It dulls memories. Ana has been gone for so long that the cranes she\u2019s folded are dusty, battered, and old. They look like I feel.\nIf the evidence of Ana\u2019s life is fading for me, what must that mean for everyone else? Will the people who knew her wake up one day and experience a kind of anosmia of the soul? Will they feel nothing when they think of her? Has that already happened?\nTime is relentless. It chips away at the memories of dead children. It blurs and obscures and erases their short legacies year after ponderous year.\nAfter five years without Ana, the cranes have largely lost their meaning. But I won\u2019t let them go, not completely. Not yet.\nI will still fold some new ones on March 22, the anniversary of her death. Feeling the cranes take shape beneath my fingers brightens my connection to Ana. At least, for a few short moments before it again begins to fade.\nThe smells began returning a few days after they\u2019d vanished. They were weak and inconsistent. The first scent that broke through the odorless void was Ana\u2019s perfume oil \u2014 a cloying, floral tincture that I\u2019d always found a bit overpowering.\nI\u2019d keep that bottle of oil all these years, occasionally breathing in the familiar smell because it\u2019s one of the few things that accurately conjure Ana\u2019s physical presence. I used to close my eyes,\u00a0inhale\u00a0deeply, and pretend she was standing right behind me.\nWhen my sense of smell vanished, I\u2019d brought the oil to my desk and gotten into the habit of smelling it multiple times a day. If anything could break the spell of Covid-induced anosmia, I\u2019d reasoned, it was that concentrated vial of perfume oil.\nThe rush of joy that filled me when I got my first faint whiff was overwhelming. I\u2019d been afraid my anosmia might be permanent. I breathed in the smell of Ana\u2019s perfume again and again. Then I started to cry.\nI want, with all the aching endlessness of my grief, for Ana to still be part of the world. I want to feel her and smell her and see her standing in front of me again.\nFive years into my grief, I understand what it means to always carry a deep well of sorrow. I understand the permanence of my grief.\nEven when I laugh, a part of my soul continues to weep. This will be my truth forever, but\u2026 at least I can smell things again.\nFor now, I will take the moments of joy wherever I can find them. Today that means holding a half-empty bottle of perfume oil up to my nose and gratefully breathing in its familiar scent.\nThis story was first published in Al Jazeera on March 22, 2022.", "comment_count": 13, "like_count": 951, "created_time": 1643548815044, "comment": [{"user_id": "43eda08cc27b", "comment_time": 1643548815044, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "ae3696dd2b63", "comment_time": 1648972246315, "comment": "A line both beautiful and achingly sad."}, {"user_id": "a68b94d4dbbd", "comment_time": 1648665411085, "comment": "Beautifully written.

Do you remember how hellish this was? It was the only time in life when it was considered perfectly normal to exist in a state of constant confusion, pit sweat, and the scent of Victoria\u2019s Secret body spray. I never knew if people liked me, hated me, or if I should even care about either option.\nNothing made sense and yet, everything felt so goddamn important. Trying to find the right thing to wear to a school dance was of equal significance as failing a calculus test, your parents getting divorced, or the fact that the boy you\u2019re crushing on had the balls to wave to you from the dugout during a baseball game while the rest of his pals looked at him like he was nuts and spat sunflower seed husks on the floor.\nJust me on that last one? Oh, right.\nGiven all of this angst and upheaval, I have a bit of compassion for the girl I was back then. Poor thing, she was prone to occasional crying and bitchiness, steady exhaustion, nicotine therapy, and pervasive horniness\u2013sometimes all within the same hour. This is 100% normal for any teenager, as science will tell us. Neurobiological studies of humans and animal adolescents are lousy with evidence to suggest that what is really going on in the brain is akin to super-charged, hormonal bumper cars on a not-fully-formed slick track, set to the dulcet tones of a volcano erupting.\nIn short, it\u2019s a freaking nightmare.\nThe more I\u2019ve studied adolescent behavior and the more I started learning about what characterizes this period in life, the more it started to look eerily familiar to the kinds of things I see popping up in the United States lately. And perhaps it\u2019s because I come from the USA, which has only been around for 246 years, but now live in a country with a 3,000-year-old culture whose personality can best be described as \u201ctastefully crotchety\u201d, that I can now see this clearly. It\u2019s the difference between a culture that has been there and done that so many times that they\u2019ve worn out the tread and a country that still gets a boner when the engine revs loud.\nThe USA is totally a teenager.\nObsession With Status\nTake, for example, this line from an article by Murray Milner Jr, a professor of sociology at UVA before he passed in 2019, \u201c Status is important to adolescents because they have so little economic or political power.\u201d I could probably finish this article now just based on that quote alone, but let\u2019s unpack this while we\u2019re here.\nIf we\u2019re talking about the economy, it seems like the whole country is acting like they don\u2019t want anyone to know their allowance got cut, doesn\u2019t it? In our own neighborhoods, people are obsessed with what car they\u2019re driving, what breed of dog they\u2019re playing fetch with, and even where they shop for groceries. Under pressure, everyone has turned into the suburban mom turning her handbag around so that people can see it\u2019s a Michael Kors.\nThe government has the same tick. The USA gave over 7 billion dollars in aid to fight COVID-19, AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria globally in 2021, but if you don\u2019t have health insurance and get sick in the USA, you can lose your house. The entire country is in hock to Japan, China, the UK, and Ireland because of searing national debt, yet they are still trying to appear that they are still Prom King on a global stage when we all know the tux is rented.\nAnd political power? This one is too easy, especially now as the Republican Party looks a lot like it\u2019s picking teams for a massive game of delinquent dodgeball. The people who jockey for position the most are the politicians who have become master boot-lickers. They are a bunch of Eugene Felsnics, desperate to high-five Danny Zuko, but only getting a palm buzzer. Tell me Lindsay Graham didn\u2019t get cut in the lunch line. Every. Single. Day.\nPure Id. Most of the Time.\nAdolescents are reward-seekers, but it\u2019s not their fault\u2013it\u2019s the hormones. They get themselves into trouble all the time in the pursuit of what\u2019s cool, what feels good, and what will get them in just enough trouble to rattle chains without getting them sent to their room \u2018till they\u2019re 30. This makes teenagers very interested in what we call \u201capproach behaviors\u201d, or moving toward doing new things instead of hiding away from them. And let\u2019s be clear. It\u2019s not like teens are looking to move toward, oh I dunno, volunteering at a homeless shelter, saving their summer job money to donate to refugee relief, or tutoring underprivileged learners. Nope, they are moving toward their own id, at speed. If you can drink it, smoke it, drive it fast, or fuck it, you\u2019ve got yourself a winner.\nNow, don\u2019t act all shocked. You know what this is because you know what it felt like in your stomach when your buddy would call you up and suggest something completely insane, though undeniably intriguing, like breaking into an abandoned estate in the woods with nothing but a flashlight, a bunch of firewood, and a half-keg of Bud Light.\nThat last one was just my high school, wasn\u2019t it? Whoops.\nThat butterfly rumble in your tummy is what makes you say yes when you should say no. It\u2019s what makes people show up to a political rally that turns into an insurrection before you can say \u201cBut, all of my friends are doing it.\u201d It\u2019s what makes a public servant seek out underage children to have sex with and then double-down by offering them drugs and passing them on to their friends under the guise of being a \u201cgenerous partner\u201d. It\u2019s also what makes you get someone pregnant through an extra-marital affair, then have the cojones to ask them to get an abortion while simultaneously supporting measures to eliminate a regular citizen\u2019s ability to do the same. Only someone looking to get a thrill sans consequences would do these things, right?\nSounds like a teenager to me.\n\u201cThey are a delightful and perplexing pain in the neck.\u201d\nEven if you don\u2019t want to agree with me on the previous points, I\u2019m pretty sure you can agree to this one. The USA is like any other teenager\u2013 a mess of contrasts and confounding elements, of both ruined and surpassed expectations. As Barbara Strauch, author of the book The Primal Teen: What the New Discoveries about the Teenage Brain Tell Us says, teenagers are likely to come home with straight As, make the varsity football team, and also get busted for cutting class to do donuts in a parking lot all in the same week.\nIt\u2019s almost as though a country that can boast the most incredible science and innovation in areas like disease detection and even the decarbonization of agriculture, yet be filled with people who think that the COVID-19 vaccine contains a microchip that will\u2013what? Turn a coffee pot on? Charge porn to your AMEX? Oh wait, it\u2019s mind control, right? Like when a big Cheez-it galoot tells you he won an election and you believe him enough to alienate your own offspring? Right.\nBut, there is also a delightful part that is infuriatingly undeniable. The United States has the power to do things in its charming, talented, optimistic way that makes you want to bean them over the head and hug them at the same time. In the country I live in, you\u2019d sooner find an Asscher cut diamond in the bottom of a box of spaghetti than find decent live music, yet you can pop in any club in the States and hear a band that kicks unholy ass any night of the week.\nIn the US, wild ideas are celebrated, not given the side-eye. You can decide that your passion is creating something as random as vegan Brazilian crepes, get a loan, and open up a shop to rave reviews. And I don\u2019t need to tell you about how beautiful the place is. I know I live one mile from Portofino, but damn, have you ever seen Antelope Canyon in Arizona? The Grand Prismatic Spring in Wyoming? The Na Pali Coast in Hawaii? They\u2019re the kind of places that make you want to get fitted for a frame backpack and load up on freeze-dried Kung Pao chicken just so you can get out there and see it all.\nLand of the adventurer and home of the pioneer spirit, big-tire 4x4s, boot-scooting, clam chowder, and New Orleans Brass bands. You simply can\u2019t not love it, if not always because of what it is\u2013for what you hope it will become.\nVery much like a teenager.\nI don\u2019t have kids, but I can imagine that being a parent through the teen years is a real molar-grinder. My own parents seem like heroes to me for exactly this reason. The amount of patience, compassion, and faith required to understand that the disastrous collection of cells before them, known as my brother and I, were going to form themselves into something worthwhile is kind of mind-blowing. My brother punctuated his teen years by backing his truck into a tree after a bad break-up and I skipped all my AP exams to smoke pot, yet he\u2019s a pediatrician and I am a researcher who went to Harvard. By conventional standards, we did OK.\nI just hope the US does OK, too.\nSo, let\u2019s hope that this is just a hormonal blip in the life of a very young country trying to prove itself. Let\u2019s have patience when the US backs itself into a few trees. Let\u2019s have compassion for its desire to become class president when most of the student body would rather avoid it in the student lounge. Let\u2019s guide it away from trying to blow up the chem lab and teach it to ask for consent before making out with the cheerleaders. Let\u2019s have faith that it will make it through this phase by the skin of its teeth and emerge into something self-aware, capable, and steadfast. But if it doesn\u2019t shape up, it should get grounded until graduation.\nIf you enjoyed this article and would like unlimited access to read work by all of the brilliant writers here on Medium, click here.", "comment_count": 23, "like_count": 1203, "created_time": 1644339320415, "comment": [{"user_id": "b1ea5b081fc4", "comment_time": 1644339320415, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "64ea03f9c148", "comment_time": 1644436419735, "comment": "Very apt and brilliantly argued throughout.

Mine was black, not navy, and my tires were chunky off-roaders, not the half-bald minivan-esque shoes you see up there. But, most of it was the same, in all of its 1987 glory.\nI know, I know. Your privilege alarm just went off, so let me address a few things before we get started. Though I grew up in a state that precisely no one would associate with the word \u201crural\u201d (or even \u201cgreen\u201d for that matter), the town that I lived in when I was a teenager was of the one-horse, no-stop-light variety. There were so few human residents despite the booming population of pygmy goats that we did not have a school system. Therefore I had to travel 30 minutes to the closest high school. My parents both worked full-time jobs and there was no one to carpool with unless, like I said, there was a particularly intelligent piece of livestock in the neighborhood who had a penchant for trigonometry. In order to not break their own stones, my parents bought me a car that proudly parked itself on the line between harmless and hoopty.\nOh, how I loved Loretta.\nAlthough my 16-year-old self had to get up at the crack of dawn to be able to get to school on time, I barely complained. And who would? When I drove down the long, dirt driveway at 6:45 a.m. every day, my fingers were already fumbling along the buttons of the tape deck to crank up whatever grunge band du jour was going to be my morning anthem. By the time I took the left turn onto Route 3, I was already pulling a Marlboro Light out of the pack that I stashed in the armrest compartment and unearthing one of at least seven lighters I had floating around in the car. I would hit the highway buzzing from nicotine, singing along with Eddie or Layne, and feeling free as a goddamned falcon.\nAnd this is really as good as it gets, isn\u2019t it? I didn\u2019t know it then because I thought everything good in life was going to start on the other side of 18. I never would have believed that right there on a Tuesday morning in November of 1992 I was living my best life while heading to class with a backpack full of homework on the passenger seat and a duffel bag full of soccer cleats in the trunk.\nI never would have believed that there would come a time when I would miss the simplicity of driving while singing along to the radio and wondering what the cute boy might say to me. I literally had nothing else to do. Now, I can\u2019t back out of the driveway without 23 notification pings on my phone, the BEEP BEEP BEEP from the backup sensor, and four tries to get the Bluetooth to connect.\nWith its 2.5 liter, 4-cylinder engine, Loretta was so underpowered that she would shake on the highway going over 65 mph \u2014 no doubt a selling point for my dad. The center console was filled with cigs and mixtapes, the glove box was packed with tampons and fast-food packets of hot sauce, and there were at least four empty cans of Diet Coke rattling around under the seats at any given time. I\u2019m pretty sure that I had at least three days of clothing changes in various locations and probably enough lipstick options to run a pageant. My biggest worry back then was if I was going to run out of gas soon and whether my outfit was in dress code. Sure, there was plenty of angst, but in my little truck with the jaunty wood panels and the colorful stickers along the back window from all of the ski spots in New Hampshire, I was A-OK.\nOur first car is, without question, the one we love the most. Some of us worked hard to be able to afford it, doing things like scraping paint off houses in summer heat or slinging burgers till our hair smelled like a fryolator. Some of us didn\u2019t have to do anything but live in the wrong town \u2014 like me. But all of us had the rosiest of rose-colored glasses for our first set of wheels, no matter how ugly, broken, or bust-out. We used them for transportation, recon, napping, studying, storage, and so, so much making out. If my car\u2019s interior could talk, it would say, \u201cDamn girl, don\u2019t your lips get chapped?\u201d\nThe answer, of course, was \u201cNot yet.\u201d\nWe love our first cars because there is perhaps no other investment that has such a dramatic effect on our everyday life. We suddenly become overwhelmed with possibilities now that we have an engine under our butts. The Jeep took me to school, to a better job at a fancier restaurant that was farther away, and to every concert I could get tickets to. It got me through winters when I had to click on the 4x4 and summers when the air conditioning never failed to cool off the top of me while the backs of my thighs still stuck to the leather seat.\nLoretta was freedom and independence, yes, but also responsibility. I felt like an adult commuting every day, keeping an eye out for the lowest gas prices and when I\u2019d need an oil change. If you ask me when I\u2019ve ever felt like a complete badass, I will tell you that it\u2019s when I was a 17-year-old girl parked in a gas station to open her own damned hood and replace her own damned windshield washer fluid. I\u2019ve run ultramarathons that didn\u2019t make me feel as cool.\nWe love our first cars because they are rolling scrapbooks filled with memories. I usually recoil at the idea of nostalgia, typically believing that it\u2019s the highlight reel of our past and not at all accurate. However, Loretta gets a pass. I made friends in that car, went on dates, broke up with boyfriends, practiced for job interviews, and once when a cyst burst on my ovary, Loretta served as an examining room for the EMTs. She drove me up north to ski and down south to visit colleges. She got full of salt from the roads, sand from the beach, and even absorbed a beer spill or two. Not mine, of course.\nSometimes, I would purposely choose to wash the car by hand in the driveway because I knew my dad would wander out from the garage with a spray bottle of Armor All in one hand and a rag in the other. I loved when he showed me how to tell if my tires needed replacing or what a bottle of STP gas additive would do for Loretta\u2019s horsepower. I didn\u2019t even mind the sharp smell of his cigar as long as he made the time to show me how to read a dipstick.\nOne of the worst days of my life was when an old lady blew a stop sign and slammed into me while I was leaving soccer practice. I cried, not because I was scared, but because I felt bad for Loretta. I hadn\u2019t had much experience with accidents and couldn\u2019t get my brain around the idea that the crunched-up metal and broken glass would be magically smoothed and restored back to its former glory. She came back to me but was never the same. The car had acquired several new shimmies and a THUNK sound when I put her in reverse. I eventually had to trade her in for a completely depressing and mediocre Honda Accord \u2014 as one does. Truth be told, I have never felt the same about another car. I am not sure that I ever will.\nIf you enjoyed this article and would like unlimited access to read work by all of the brilliant writers here on Medium, click here.", "comment_count": 11, "like_count": 506, "created_time": 1649672568703, "comment": [{"user_id": "b1ea5b081fc4", "comment_time": 1649672568703, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "be5e9fed1b7d", "comment_time": 1649733603105, "comment": "I feel so sad you had to trade Loretta in..

Here\u2019s What\u2019s Bringing Me Joy This Week.\nTake two of these and call me in the morning.\nPhoto by Lidya Nada on Unsplash\nDo you remember the scene in The Neverending Story when Artax the horse couldn\u2019t stop his wee equine brain from thinking dreadful thoughts and got sucked up by the swamp of sadness? Yeah, that\u2019s kind of how I feel lately too. And I know what you\u2019re going to say. You\u2019re right. I\u2019ve been doom scrolling so hard I actually made myself motion sick. Turns out that\u2019s a thing you can do by the way. What kind of an idiot tweaks out their own vestibular system so it thinks it\u2019s at sea while lying completely still under a duvet?\nThis kind of idiot.\nIt is obvious to me that unless someone drives a cannon straight up the hind end of everyone\u2019s favorite Russian multi-hyphenate butcher-dictator-psychopath, finds a way to decarbonize global energy systems, or can eradicate COVID off the Earth faster than Ivanka will fold under questioning, we\u2019re gonna\u2019 be here for a while.\nI can\u2019t keep making myself sick and neither can you, frankly. I\u2019ve found some tiny glimmers of joy over the last few weeks and I\u2019d like to share them. I\u2019m hoping that at least one of these will be interesting to you or that you\u2019ll be inspired to find your own little flower among the dung heap.\nBut first, some rules. I picked things that I either watched, ate, listened to, or otherwise engaged with. There are plenty of things that I simply learned about that make me very happy too, like the existence of the all-women\u2019s 4x4 Rally Jameel in Saudi Arabia which began just five years after females were granted the right to drive, but they don\u2019t count since I did not directly engage with them. (Though, holy crap, I want to engage with that race, like, right now.)\nSo, let\u2019s have a bit of fun, shall we?\nThe Ram Dass \u201cHere and Now\u201d Podcast\nI kept hearing about Ram Dass and what a wonderful, loving being he was before he passed in 2019, but I had no idea who he was. I am admittedly late to the party on this one, but it\u2019s not my fault. My family had two 50s and a 70s, so there was no way anyone was talking about ashrams and enlightenment around the dinner table. The only spirituality I grew up with was whatever fit in between the words of the novena my grandmother was hoping would help her win on Bingo night at church. So, I was very curious.\nThe podcast starts with the first lectures that Ram Dass gave when he got back from India and they had me addicted immediately. (In fact, I highly suggest that you start at episode 1 and work forward.) I\u2019ve downloaded a bunch of episodes and have been going for crazy long walks listening to him talk about traveling through India, meeting his guru, meditating in caves, \u201cwearing a dress\u201d (his words, not mine), and coming back to the US to share the message. It is like taking a trip on a time machine back to a moment where people could do this kind of stuff authentically. Can you imagine a white dude from Harvard doing this now and then trying to tell all of us how magical it was? He would be just another post on Insta sponsored by a yoga mat company that we would scroll past before getting to more bump shots of Riri.\nThere is something so pure and earnest about Ram Dass in these lectures. I love it when he cracks jokes\u2013usually about himself. I love hearing his wonky Boston accent when he pronounces Himalayas as \u201cHim-al-yaz\u201d. I love when he disarms people with explanations of truth, oneness, consciousness, and love itself. When everything else I hear is making my skin crawl, Ram Dass is getting under it.\nI wanted to dismiss these lectures as hippie chatter, but that\u2019s just because I was afraid to have a little fun. I wanted to be skeptical, but honestly\u2013how well is that working out for me? How well is it working out for you?\nGo and fire up a little Baba Ram Dass, breathe deep, and go for a walk in the woods. I promise you\u2019ll feel lighter than a rip off a big \u2018ol spliff.\nGrowing Out Gray TikTok\nLet me just be clear: I do not use Tik Tok. I should, I know, but I simply can\u2019t allocate more time to learning another skill that will only deepen the crease between my eyebrows. I do know how to search on TikTok and that, my friends, is what led me to the oddly satisfying category of videos where women show their hair color growing out to gray.\nI don\u2019t even know how to explain why this brings me so much joy. There\u2019s just something awesome about seeing the transformation take place, inch by inch. There is so much patience and grace involved in walking around looking like a parakeet for a full year and I am here for it. In every single case, the woman seems one million times happier with her natural hair color and you can tell by her smile that she is fully feeling herself. Look, it\u2019s not every day that women can celebrate a win over beauty standards, so I find this delightful.\nUbe Potatoes\nI am going to admit that this one is 80% aesthetic because PURPLE. Don\u2019t get me wrong, these potatoes are delicious, but when\u2019s the last time I got to eat something this color? Nerds, Gatorade, Skittles, Now and Laters, Boo-Berry Cereal, grape juice, that\u2019s it. The adult in me knows that purple foods are good for me because they are rich in antioxidants, but the kid in me goes, \u201cOhhh prettyyyy!\u201d\nBoth facts are going to keep me alive longer.\nI\u2019m not saying that you have to eat ube to find joy, although there is a Filipino bakery in Los Angeles that appears to be ready to argue that point (Can you say, \u201cUbe Tres Leches Cake\u201d?) I am just saying that not every food choice has to be serious. Like, you can have a day off from low-carb, organic, grass-fed, artisanal pea pollen or whatever. Live a little.\nBridgerton\nCome on, you knew this was coming. I do not care what anyone thinks about Bridgerton, but I am obsessed with both seasons. Nowhere in modern television are you going to find such a perfect accumulation of beautiful people in beautiful places doing beautiful things and I invite anyone to fight me on that\u2013in a duel at dawn, of course.\nRight now, this is all I want to watch. I am not interested in Vikings or drug dealers, con-artists or people who speak to the dead. I don\u2019t care about housewives, bachelors, or rich teenagers and I sure as hell don\u2019t want to watch anything get blown up when there\u2019s enough of that going on 1200 miles from where I am sitting.\nI want boughs of wisteria, horseback flirting, spoon licking, tea cakes, up-dos with birds in them, smoldering glances, glittering ballrooms, breathless snogging, glasses of champagne, visits to the modiste, promenades in the park, a string ensemble playing Harry Styles, and the utter ecstasy of ruination under a flowering pergola.\nCan Ted Lasso do that?\nNo.\nIt doesn\u2019t matter what you normally like to watch\u2013even if you\u2019re a guy. Wait, especially if you\u2019re a guy. There\u2019s nothing that\u2019s not joyful about Bridgerton. (OK, except maybe the bee part.) And if you don\u2019t believe me, start with Season 1, Episode 6. You\u2019ll never look at a library ladder the same way.\nAre you feeling inspired? Did I give you any ideas? I am pretty confident that if you try at least one of the aforementioned offerings, you\u2019re going to have a better day than if you scrolled yourself to Dramamine.\nEven if you don\u2019t feel like a colorful tuber is going to be your gateway to bliss, maybe you\u2019ll rejoice over some videos of a five year old skater girl who crushes ramps in a pink dress, or a live cam feed from a llama farm, or a recipe for Kanelbullar. It doesn\u2019t really matter as long as it reminds you that there is still some smile left in the tube. You might just have to squeeze extra hard.\nIf you enjoyed this article and would like unlimited access to read work by all of the brilliant writers here on Medium, click here.", "comment_count": 11, "like_count": 457, "created_time": 1649256243027, "comment": [{"user_id": "b1ea5b081fc4", "comment_time": 1649256243027, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "cc4af338f140", "comment_time": 1649328288758, "comment": "Me too!!

By Steve Jurvetson from Menlo Park, USA \u2014 Amusing Muses, CC BY 2.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=5913108\nElizabeth Gilbert makes me want to throw my computer off a cliff. If you guessed that I am jealous of her talent, you\u2019d be correct, but that is not the reason why she makes me feel terrible. No, I feel like breaking something expensive because after reading three of her books, it is clear to me that I am so squarely centered in her demographic that it\u2019s like I\u2019ve got a target on my back. It\u2019s like she ran a focus group for over-educated, middle-class white women who fancied themselves sexy at one point, but really only wanted to be good girls, and then wrote every book about their deepest, darkest fears coming to life. She\u2019s got my number so hard and I hate it\u2013but also love it.\nLet\u2019s discuss.\nI came to Liz\u2013 or rather, Liz came to me when the CAT scan tech that worked with my mom left a copy of Eat, Pray, Love it in the break room that always smelled like Italian subs. \u201cI bet Jill will like it,\u201d she said when my mom asked if she meant to leave it behind. I side-eyed the book for a solid month before I picked it up, but good \u2018ol Liz had me in a sleeper hold as soon as I read her existential lamentations about leaving her husband on the leeward side of forty. As a woman who got divorced just shy of her thirtieth birthday, I mopped that shit up with toast.\n\u201cThe only thing more unthinkable than leaving was staying; the only thing more impossible than staying was leaving.\u201d\n-from Eat, Pray, Love.\nYes, ma\u2019am, just go ahead and put it in my veins. I left my first husband while living in the Caribbean and desperately needed justification for both driving down the Baldorioty de Castro expressway while blasting \u201cBreakaway\u201d by Kelly Clarkson and promptly taking up with a Taekwondo instructor ten years my junior. Which part of that sentence doesn\u2019t paint me as a diehard member of the Liz Gilbert Pep Club?\nIt wasn\u2019t just the New England Princess angst that sang to my soul, it was the fact that the entire book provided justification for a series of decisions I made in pursuit of my own happiness that only wrapped up relatively recently. In the years that followed, I ate and prayed and loved from one end of the USA to the other and added a few countries in for good measure. The book gave me permission. It gave us permission. The undeniable privilege of never having to seriously consider saying \u201cno\u201d to something outlandish, whether in service of love or ego, is the mark of this sisterhood.\nAnd who among us doesn\u2019t want to write a book?\nI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s hubris. It wasn\u2019t in my case. I\u2019ve wanted to write a book since I knew what books were. It seemed like a thing I had to do like losing my virginity or trying sushi for the first time. It sure as hell wasn\u2019t because I thought I\u2019d be good at it.\nThe problem was that I couldn\u2019t get myself to actually do it. This might be a privilege thing again, I admit. I had a full-time job and was\u2013you know, suuuper busy or whatever we tell ourselves. I had the desire, but I didn\u2019t have the hunger. I didn\u2019t have to.\nBut, Miz Liz came to save me.\nMy husband had a business trip in Rome one January and invited me to come along. (Don\u2019t get all excited. I live here in Italy and this was at the height of the garbage crisis in Rome when the entire city was overrun with pizza boxes, plastic bags full of soiled diapers, and stinky wine empties.) I knew I\u2019d be on my own for most of the entire week, so I downloaded a bunch of audiobooks from the library and figured I would just skulk around and try not to step in too much dog shit.\nOne of those books was Big Magic. It set me real straight, real quick.\nThe audiobook was read by the author herself so I felt like there was nowhere in the entire city of Rome to hide from this big sister/fairy godmother who whispered, lectured, and sometimes yelled into my ears for the first three days of the trip. She told me that whatever bullshit I was telling myself about not starting that book was useless, that I was wasting my time and goddamn it\u2013since the universe is connected and ideas are like hobos on a freight car and libel to hitch from one of us to the other, I might damn well be wasting her time too. But, she also romanced me, told me I was capable, and better than that\u2013she told me that I was divine.\n\u201cThe universe buries strange jewels deep within us all, and then stands back to see if we can find them.\u201d\n-from Big Magic\nWell, shit. That quote was a proposition. It was a dare. Miz Liz was setting me up on a blind date with whatever limp little talent troll lay within me. \u201cI know it looks like a chump, but it just needs the right caress,\u201d she said. She made me square my shoulders and get in there. And I did.\nI started my book the day I finished hers.\nOf course, \u201cterrible\u201d has many flavors and Elizabeth Gilbert helped me find another one to add to my menu when I read City of Girls.\nI don\u2019t think this book would have made sense to me had I read it in my 20s. I would have probably had the experience that the book jacket quotes wanted me to have when it claimed I was in for \u201ca breezy, entertaining read \u2014 and really, something better: a lively, effervescent, and sexy portrait of a woman living in a golden time\u201d and that it \u201cmakes you want to smoke too many cigarettes and laugh with your head thrown back.\u201d Depressingly, I probably would have focused on the sex, the partying, and the scandal. If I was lucky, I may have tossed a passing glance at the ode to enduring female friendship.\nMaybe.\nInstead, I read it as an oxidized 45-year-old who not only remembers what happened after the curtain fell after her mistakes, but spent the better part of two decades hoping that she could forgive herself for being so flagrantly stupid. When you\u2019re young, you will not realize that the fun you think you\u2019re having will put your very own self into therapy years later. You will not be able to square that idiot with the idiot you\u2019re trying not to be, but somehow are afraid that you still are.\n\u201cA woman of your type often believes she is a person of significance because she can make trouble and spoil things for others. But she is neither important nor interesting.\u201d \u2014 from City of Girls\nThere\u2019s our fear written in cold black and white. We. Are. Not. Interesting.\nAll of those games we played and chances we took, all of those times we said \u201cyes\u201d when we should have gone home early\u2013we think that those stories will make us unique. We\u2019d rather die than be basic, so we bank on the blurry memories of whatever went down as cachet.\nI\u2019m sorry to say that I think I\u2019m with Liz on this one. Riding high for ten minutes in 1996 will not insulate us from the doldrums of middle age or keep a twinkle in our eye when we\u2019re 80. But, you can\u2019t tell a 22-year old that not ordering a third Cosmo will be the thing that she\u2019s proud of when she\u2019s far enough down the road that what\u2019s going on in the rearview begins to look pretty again.\nI didn\u2019t know how terrible I would feel reading Elizabeth Gilbert precisely because I had no idea how common I truly am. However, I am grateful for her to have shown me the truth. She provided me with excuses but told me I didn\u2019t deserve any. She told me I was divine but then reminded me of my humanity. I hate it. I love it. She\u2019s right about all of it.\nThis is not an act. If you watch her on any podcast or TedTalk, you\u2019ll see that she talks like this too. Weirdly, it doesn\u2019t feel like we are being preached to. It feels like we\u2019re peeking over her shoulder at all of the Post-it notes-to-self she\u2019s got tacked all around her desk. She\u2019s not doing this just for us. She\u2019s doing it because she\u2019s one of us.\nI heard she\u2019s working on another book right now and I\u2019m a little nervous to see what other ridiculous facet of my/your/our life she will unwrap and filet open like a big, fat cod. I\u2019m going to read it anyway and do what I did in Rome\u2013try not to step in too much shit.\nIf you enjoyed this article and would like unlimited access to read work by all of the brilliant writers here on Medium, click here.", "comment_count": 22, "like_count": 1653, "created_time": 1648669999029, "comment": [{"user_id": "b1ea5b081fc4", "comment_time": 1648669999029, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "55aa057bd8db", "comment_time": 1648907060350, "comment": "Yes it is difficult to see how common we are.

I think it was through a mutual friend who enjoyed debating him. But to help you get a sense of who Ryan is, here\u2019s a glory-reel of his greatest posts (used with permission):\n\u201cExpecting the lamestream media, globalist elites and the snowflakes to meltdown in around 26 hours\u2019 time yet again as their long-promised blue wave will turn red.\u201d\nAnd\u2026\n\u201c[People] who call upon the Name of our Saviour Jesus Christ should realise that the same-sex marriage postal plebiscite is actually a test on whether they are praying and appealing to the Father God for mercy and forgiveness.\u201d\nAnd last but not least\u2026\n\u201cQ is the 17th letter of the alphabet. This year is the 17th anniversary of 9/11. Could this be the day when the truth will begin to be revealed and the Deep State be exposed for all they are?\u201d\nCrazy, right?\nNow for a long time, I\u2019d engage with Ryan\u2019s posts. I\u2019d come in on my white horse, sure to shed the light of day unto thee. And sure enough, that never happened. Instead, we\u2019d get into comment wars \u2014 endless, circular, soul-destroying \u2014 with both unable to entirely convince the other they were wrong, and each leaving equally sure of themselves.\nSo then for a long time, I disengaged. I switched off. I scrolled past. I think for a bit I even muted him.\nBut recently, and maybe this has come with age, my view has softened. I\u2019m no longer that angry young man, out to prove a point \u2014 I, like most of us, have glimpsed the folly of online echo-chambers and search-bubbles and Like-o-rithms and the Twittersphere. And I\u2019ve begun to note more seriously the tension and division it\u2019s creating \u2014 not only across the web and across the media, but also IRL. It got me thinking \u2014 yes there\u2019s differences between us, but when did that become so cataclysmic? Why are we all so convicted of our own bullshit? Where\u2019s our humility gone? What is going on?\nSo, one fateful day as I chanced upon one of Ryan\u2019s Facebook posts, I had an all too uncommon idea \u2014 instead of commenting, I messaged him...\nMark: \u201cHey Ryan. I hope you don\u2019t mind me reaching out like this. I\u2019m super curious about what you think, and how and why you think like you do [\u2026] Let me know if you\u2019d like to catch up for a coffee some time soon. Cheers.\u201d\nA few hours later, he replied.\nRyan: \u201cHi Mark\u2026 interesting to hear from you. Tell me more about this and we can schedule a time to chat actually.\u201d\nWhat followed was a rather pleasant exchange about what we were both up to in our lives, what we\u2019re writing about (he\u2019s a writer too), and even a sincere tangent about internet-induced depression. Long story short, a date was set.\nA week out from Ryan\u2019s and my meeting, I was talking with a friendly acquaintance in their kitchen about the whole idea.\nNow, I\u2019d consider this friend to be fairly open-minded, but when I mentioned that I\u2019d be catching up with Ryan for lunch, a visible scowl came over his face. It seemed to say \u201cYou\u2019ve gotta be careful\u201d, or even \u201cWhy are you talking to someone like that?\u201d\nAfterward, thoughts ran through my mind. Was I legitimising Ryan? Was I giving him a platform? These thoughts have followed me even to this sentence. But the more I thought about it, the more I realised this very mentality is part of the problem we\u2019re seeing play out online. With echo chambers of opinion closing off to the outside world. With increasing social tension offline too.\n\u201cI\u2019ll be careful,\u201d I said.\nFinally, the day comes.\nIt\u2019s lunchtime, and Ryan and I have organised to catch up at the university where he works as a tutor. I pass an LGBTIQ+ Cupcake Sale and, being unfamiliar to the campus, I ask for directions. I wonder if Ryan has passed the same stall and will raise it during our chat.\nAfter zig-zagging the campus for a while, I find Ryan in the hipstery food zone where all the cool uni students hang. He looks gentle and unassuming, but also a little out of place. In a sea of Nikes and bomber jackets, he\u2019s sporting rectangular reading glasses and a big white jumper, under the collar of which are clipped two red pens for marking. His black hair is swept back and thinning a little (like me) \u2014 and he\u2019s a smaller build than most (also like me). Yet here we are, two dudes off the internet, surrounded by a millennial montage.\nWe grace through small talk and find a quiet room.\n\nNow, heading into this conversation, my mindset is to understand the other. I don\u2019t want to correct or confirm \u2014 I just want to let Ryan speak and hear out his point of view. Sure, I\u2019ll poke around the edges if something feels fishy. But largely, I just want to see where the conversation goes if neither of us make any judgements about the other.\nI explain all this to Ryan. He agrees. And so, I launch into the first of only two big questions I have for him \u2014 \u201cWhat are the most important things you believe, day-to-day?\u201d\nI start here because, so often online, we just assume we know what the other person is thinking. This is especially dangerous over social media, because we have far less clues about what the person means \u2014 all we have are their words, emojis, an avatar or username, maybe a timecode that gives a little more context. In real life we have volume, tone of voice, body language, expressions etc. \u2014 yet despite the less information available to us when interacting with someone online, we tend to double-down on our ability to read their mind.\nAnyway \u2014 Ryan\u2019s answer is simple, but multi-layered.\n\u201cI am a conservative freethinker, but more than that I\u2019m a Bible-believing Christian. And from a Christian perspective, we are supposed to give glory to God,\u201d he says. At this point he errs, \u201cBut increasingly I\u2019m seeing a conflict between myself, the syllabus, and the society\u2026\u201d\nThat \u2018conflict\u2019, as Ryan expands on, is the urgency he feels coming from the inevitable fall of Western society in a number of dimensions \u2014 economic, financial, but also moral and spiritual. Something the uni prohibits him from speaking about to his students.\n\u201cHere is the situation I can see in the Developed World \u2014 it\u2019s in countries that are affluent that start questioning \u2018why do we need to believe in God?\u2019 They concoct ideas to explain away God.\u201d He continues, \u201cPeople complain when their coffee is not hot enough, whereas I look at the bigger problem\u2026\u201d\nRyan explains as Western developed nations stray from their \u201cJudeo-Christian heritage\u201d we risk removing a \u201cstandard\u201d of moral behaviour \u2014 specifically, God\u2019s absolute standard.\nHe cites China as an example, and to an extent Hong Kong, where he emigrated to Australia from at age 7. \u201cChinese culture came from Taoist, Confucian traditions and also the Legalist School. Their values have transformed since the 1990s because of Deng Xiaoping\u2019s Chinese Economic Reform \u2014 which has led to a very utilitarian perspective. People who are very rich are then seen to be virtuous, even though it can be anything but.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe thing that I see to not work with progressivism, is the belief that we can set better standards [than God]. And then it becomes people jostling on what is a good standard. And who wins? Might is right. And if you put [that] into a system, a Government system \u2014 it never, ever, works. Because there will be an absolute totalitarianism in the end. If you remove the absolute standard, it becomes a free-for-all.\u201d\nHere he discusses the Hegelian Dialectic, adapted from Heinrich Moritz Chalyb\u00e4us\u2019s threefold capitulation of it, as a method through which power is transferred in a society \u2014 first, \u201can astute political leader\u201d creates a problem, then they \u201cgain power by appearing virtuous\u201d, and finally, solve it. \u201cIf people lift the curtain, they [would] see you were the one who was very instrumental in actually creating the problem,\u201d Ryan explains excitedly.\nI can tell he\u2019s getting a kick out of sharing his ideas with me. And so far, I can nod along. I mean, you could argue that the Catholic Church had absolute totalitarian rule of Western society for at least a thousand years \u2014 but at least it was a thousand years, right? In the history of semi-stable societies, that\u2019s a long run. And, as Ryan will agree, the Church is only the human institution \u2014 what matters is the thing beneath it; the philosophical underpinnings and organising principles of a society. Before the Enlightenment, the Bible propped up the table just fine. And it could seem, from Ryan\u2019s eyes, that now we\u2019re struggling to stop the table from wobbling. That the replacements, (the US Constitution possibly, the UNHCR as well) ain\u2019t working out\u2026\nThis, though, is where Ryan\u2019s worldview takes too literal a turn and too big a leap of faith for me.\n\u201cI believe in the spiritual world, especially in the past 2\u20133 years,\u201d Ryan says, \u201cI can see there is the Holy Spirit \u2014 and then there is the demonic and satanic spirits, who we can\u2019t \u2018see\u2019, but we can actually see the results of their works through people who do terrible things.\u201d\nWe talk here for a bit, but I feel I\u2019ve got a grasp now of what Ryan believes: Remove God\u2019s standard (the Bible), and all hell breaks loose \u2014 figuratively (with financial collapse, political upheaval, social unrest etc.) and literally (with actual demons and satanic spirits). And this is what we\u2019re seeing play out now, from Ryan\u2019s point of view, at least partly in the LGBTIQ+ Cupcake Sale I passed on the way to meet him.\n\nI can tell Ryan is more relaxed \u2014 he\u2019s downed his lunch, we\u2019re both leaning back in our chairs \u2014 so at this point, I want to understand more about Ryan as a person, and the path he took to get where he is today. I switch gears and ask the second of my two big questions\u2014 \u201cHow did you come to believe what you believe?\u201d\n\u201cWell it\u2019s an interesting one because my parents are not Christian,\u201d Ryan says, \u201cThey actually were, um, \u2014well, my mother is quite against it.\u201d\n\u201cRight,\u201d I say.\n\u201cFunnily enough they enrolled us in two Catholic primary schools,\u201d says Ryan. \u201cBut when we came to Australia we went to a public school \u2014 I was put into Catholic Scripture class, my brother was put into, um \u2014 \u201d\nRyan\u2019s whole demeanour has shifted. He\u2019s now more tentative about what he says. I begin to sense discomfort. But he continues.\n\u201cSomeone approached [my brother] from the Inter-School Christian Fellowship and invited him to go. And um, he went, and when I went to high school \u2014 I followed my brother in going. At that stage, I was \u2014 there was a\u2026 competitiveness, a competitive spirit, in me towards my brother. I liked to follow him, but I also want to um \u2014 \u201d\n\u201cBeat him where he goes?\u201d I ask.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Ryan says.\n\u201cIs he an older brother?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s an older brother.\u201d\n\u201cI have an older brother too. I can identify.\u201d\nRyan opens up, \u201cI had a complex, which also partly my mother fuelled, that\u2026 that I didn\u2019t measure up to my brother. I always wanted to show her that she was wrong.\u201d\nRyan explains how he went to the Inter-School Christian Fellowship group as a heady 13 year old, confident he could reconcile his Catholic faith and the more Protestant flavour they taught there. It wasn\u2019t long before he was \u201cchallenged\u201d by a leader who asked why he should be allowed into Heaven.\n\u201cI gave the Catholic answer which was about how I did the right thing and all that, and he told me \u2018No, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what would get you in heaven\u2019 and I, I was a bit offended \u2014 which I actually think is one of the best things that could happen to anyone.\u201d\nHe continued, \u201cI always believe that if a faith doesn\u2019t offend someone who listens to it, you haven\u2019t actually spoken. You haven\u2019t actually shared your faith with them. Why? Because you haven\u2019t gotten to a point, where it makes them question. You don\u2019t have to offend them to the point where they get pissed off, but offend them as in \u2014 make them question, do they have it right?\u201d\nSomething twigs in me at this point\u2026 Is this why Ryan is so offensive on social media? So provocative with his rants, much like a particular Trump or the Westboro Baptist Church? Is he trying to use the same tactic that shook him, to shake everyone on his Facebook?\nYou see, there\u2019s something about social media which exaggerates our interactions with one another in strange and dangerous ways \u2014 and I think it\u2019s this: A post or a comment seem so much bigger than they are, because we imagine an internet-sized audience looking on. Because of this, our conversations take on the character of a Shakespearean performance, less an honest dialogue \u2014 two starstruck commenters battle the cosmos for ultimate victory, as the universe nervously looks on.\nAdditionally, we each imagine a slightly different universe looking on. The Conservatives imagine their buds behind them, and the dangerously naive femi-nazi SJWs opposing them. And the Progressives imagine their buds behind them, and the racist transphobic alt-right KKK kekboys opposing them. Which means we\u2019re no longer having a civil conversation, or a single conversation for that matter. This is why so many of our comments seem to miss each other \u2014 as Tim Minchin describes it, we\u2019re \u201clike two tennis players trying to win a match by hitting beautifully executed shots from either end of separate tennis courts.\u201d\nI might joke about it above, but the effect of this performative exaggeration on our online interactions is that it changes our ideas about how conversations in the real world are meant to play out. Our expectations shift. Now whenever we interact with someone or something, there\u2019s a subtly heightened consideration in the back of our minds: \u201cWhat will other people think? About what I\u2019m saying? About me?\u201d.\nCall me Foucault, but this self-surveilling, I believe, is slowly eating away at our ability to interact with each other \u2014 online and IRL.\n\nBack to the conversation at hand \u2014 I want to circle back to Ryan\u2019s mother, because I sensed tension when he mentioned her earlier. It turns out Ryan\u2019s mum met his dad during a protest for China\u2019s claim to the Senkaku Islands (Ryan jokes that he comes from a very \u201cpassionate\u201d bloodline). She\u2019s a \u201cvery streetwise woman\u201d, as Ryan explains, \u201cshe\u2019s the eldest surviving child in her family, and from about the age of 12 or 13 she took on the responsibility of looking after her siblings.\u201d\nHe goes on, \u201cMy mother at that stage was quite progressive and left-leaning, and now she vehemently hates the communist party \u2014 but she still believes in authority is right, and even if it\u2019s wrong at times.\u201d\nI ask a delicate question. \u201cSo, was she \u2018alright\u2019 with you before you guys came to Australia?\u201d\n\u201cNup,\u201d Ryan says bluntly. \u201cWell, I was always the one who argued with her more, even when I was a child. She always says, I was the harder one to bring up, because I had my own will.\u201d\nHe pauses. \u201cI actually got that from her\u2014 I\u2019m a chip off her when it comes to personality.\u201d\nSuddenly it all clicks.\n\u201cAnd my older brother is a chip off my father,\u201d Ryan says.\n\u201cYeah! Right!\u201d I exclaim, \u201cSo because she loves your father, she loves your older brother.\u201d\n\u201cYeah exactly,\u201d Ryan says.\nUnfortunately, as Ryan goes on to explain, his mother\u2019s bias has led to a lot of undue trouble in his life. He describes encountering \u201cdifficulties\u201d \u2014 feeling \u201cvery unhappy after a series of attempts at relationships\u201d (I can relate), struggling to find work after uni (I can relate), and after finally being placed in a high-paying HK-based job (I can\u2019t relate), quitting after just 8 days due to the pressure of it all. By the end of it, he found himself questioning, \u201cIf I\u2019m a good person in God\u2019s eyes, why am I not able to get what I would like?\u201d and even, \u201cam I believing in the right God?\u201d\nSounds like a period of clinical depression to me. And throughout it all, Ryan\u2019s mother was unsupportive.\n\u201cMy mother \u2014 she\u2019s a very\u2026.\u201d, he hesitates, \u201cYou could say, she wants things to be under control. And, um, our disputes from university onwards were always about \u2018How come you can\u2019t do this\u2026\u2019, \u2018How come you\u2019re not going and getting a proper job\u2026\u2019, \u2018 You should go and get a mortgage\u2026\u2019\u201d\nI ask him, \u201cIt goes back to you being measured against your older brother, right?\u201d\n\u201cYes exactly,\u201d he pauses. \u201cI have the perception that I don\u2019t tick many boxes in her life, in her standards.\u201d\nEventually, Ryan learned to put every last bit of his faith into God. \u201cIncreasingly I was going, \u2018Am I thinking the wrong way about God?\u2019\u201d Ryan says, \u201cAm I god of him? Or is he God of me?\u201d\nAnd that, finally, is how Ryan got to his beliefs today.\n\nLeaving, I\u2019m struck by how similar our stories are \u2014 both younger brothers who to an extent feel as though they grew up in their brother\u2019s shadows, both went through a period of depression and self-doubt, both felt at some point relationshipless and jobless and futureless, and for me, faithless \u2014 yet, despite our similarities, we\u2019ve both grown to be two very different people.\nAs I start relaying this observation to Ryan, he runs into a young man (let\u2019s say Tim) accompanied by a female friend. Tim is one of Ryan\u2019s students \u2014 and no sooner do they greet one another are they speaking, in what seems to be quite a loud volume and in quite a pass\u00e9 tone, about \u201cthe fucking pedophiles\u201d* and that \u201csexual assault is what the Government calls \u2018rape\u2019\u201d. (*Tim is the potty-mouth here, not Ryan)\nAt this point, I notice Tim\u2019s female friend, who had been walking with Tim until he ran into Ryan, has now fallen well back, so as not to be associated with us three \u2014 and I too, where I had felt drawn toward moments before, now feel actively repelled.\nMy experience, of talking to someone with a radically different point of view from me, should not be that uncommon. Yet, weirdly it is.\nSocial media has trained us to hunker down in our own circles, surround ourselves by what is comfortable \u2014 and when we do venture outside our comfort zones, to perform our positions and never give an inch.\nI used to see Ryan as the epitome of that mentality.\nNow, a very different picture of Ryan has formed \u2014 a picture of a young man who had felt very powerless throughout his life, and now spent a great deal of time thinking about what power is, who has it, and how it works. Of someone who never felt like he measured up to his brother, now preoccupied with measuring up to his God.\nRightly or wrongly, you can\u2019t deny the profundity of that picture. And I wouldn\u2019t have gotten there if I\u2019d never engaged with Ryan on the human level. Because when you boil people down to pixels on a screen, it\u2019s easy to forget that they\u2019re much more than the ideas and beliefs they hold, whatever side of the aisle they may be on.\nSo, the next time you see a right-wing troll posting a multi-paragraph rant on your feed, resist the urge to snap back.\nPerhaps, instead, ask them out for lunch.", "comment_count": 10, "like_count": 596, "created_time": 1526532192564, "comment": [{"user_id": "5550b5b919a0", "comment_time": 1526532192564, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "a29075f9ee34", "comment_time": 1548871455867, "comment": "This is a great article Mark!

No line for cheesecake at Uncle Tetsu\u2019s, but also no cheesecake. The traffic lights blip out their metallic song to an auditorium of cooly-lit buildings and birds. Even the trams have gone to sleep for the night. At times I wish I was a machine like them, a robot who could power off precisely at 1:56am, then resume services precisely at 5:22.\nIf only.\nInsomnia doesn\u2019t happen overnight. For me, it started with a few bad nights. Soon I was waking, every night at 2am, unable to nod back off.\nI\u2019m one of the 14.8% of Australians who, according to the Sleep Health Foundation, have either been diagnosed with or display symptoms of clinical insomnia. A broader 60% report trouble sleeping. Some researchers have noted that, since COVID-19, that number has risen.\nMost Australians don\u2019t seek medical help for sleep issues, chalking it up to just being a bad sleeper. When they do, it\u2019s often tacked onto another consult. Commonly prescribed are OTC Melatonin tablets, to mixed results. When I took some, I started with 1 before needing double. By my calculations, I\u2019d have soon needed 32,000 tablets per night.\nA 24/7 security car crosses the tram-tracks ahead. It\u2019s a Toyota Yaris. Imagine being a crook and being caught by a Yaris.\nThere are nangs in the gutters of Martin Place. The council\u2019s flowerbeds shake beneath the streetlights. Purple and white. Orange. Green. Flags advertising festivals flap in the wind corridor formed between the Big 4 banks as though blown by an ancient hairdryer.\nI pass a homeless man in a blue sleeping bag on a bus stop bench. I wonder which of us is having the better sleep tonight. Would he get more out of my bed than me? Probably.\nThe causes of insomnia are various \u2014 irregular sleep patterns, substances, certain medications. Most causes however, are mental.\n\u201cInsomnia is one of the core symptoms of many psychological disorders, including the two most common ones, depression and anxiety,\u201d says Dr Tim Sharp, Founder and Chief Happiness Officer at the Happiness Institute in Sydney. \u201cBut in turn, insomnia can cause or exacerbate mental ill-health.\u201d\n\u201cPeople with long-term sleeping difficulties often fall into a cycle of anxiety and worry,\u201d says Lisa Stedman, principal psychologist at Mind Journey Psychology, and whom I started seeing for my issues. \u201cThe worry about not being able to sleep keeps you from sleeping, which reinforces the worry.\u201d\nThis I can vouch for. As my eyes popped reliably open at 2am, I felt painfully awake \u2014 heart and mind racing, feet writhing against the bedsheets, wishing and wishing to sleep.\nPerhaps the hardest thing about insomnia is how isolating it is, how quiet you have to be. The taste of your morning breath forming.\nOffice after office is for lease. The EzyMart at Circular Quay is closed. But in the window I see American breakfast cereals, coloured and hopeful, lit by white fluorescent tubes. Reese\u2019s Puffs. Cinnamon Toast Crunch. Lucky Charms. On the other side of the world children would be eating this right now. The cartoon leprechaun printed on the box smiles widely \u2014 I wonder how many cavities are in his grin.\nWith no people around, the Sydney Opera House looks like a spaceship on a launchpad. Hundreds of seagulls circle above its brightly lit sails, thinking it\u2019s daytime. I watch them swirl and swirl, and never once crash into each other.\nMy darkest night was here in 2018. My partner and I had tickets to see Kevin McCloud of \u2018Grand Designs\u2019 fame, and trying to will a good night\u2019s sleep for it, I got zero sleep instead. Loud and paralysing anxiety that I would never sleep again, and die delirious, drowned out all of Kevin\u2019s charming British voice.\nI saw a psychiatrist after a second sleepless night in a row, locked in a spell of fear \u2014 what\u2019s clinically called a mixed affective state, an acute state where symptoms of depression and mania coexist. He had patients\u2019 paintings on the walls and golf trophies on his windowsill. A single white hair sprouted between his eyebrows like a sunflower. Finger by finger he listened and typed notes, his calming demeanour assuring me there was no emergency here.\nI was prescribed anti-depressants and mood-stabilisers, and slept well.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt medications can help some people,\u201d says Tim. \u201cBut the question should always be \u2018do the pros outweigh the cons?\u2019\u201d\n\u201cSleeping pills occasionally can get you a good night\u2019s sleep,\u201d says Lisa, but notes these can be \u201chabit-forming\u201d and difficult to stop taking. She encourages behavioural strategies that address underlying anxiety and worry.\nMedicine did help me. But during the first COVID-19 outbreak, my insomnia returned \u2014 and now even meds did nothing. I needed to address the deeper issue.\nThe seagulls outside St Mary\u2019s Cathedral are sleeping with their red legs up. Their heads are swivelled backwards and buried in their plumage. It looks uncomfortable, but 33,000,000 years of evolution can\u2019t be wrong.\nThe Coca Cola sign at King\u2019s Cross flashes for no one but a few cabbies drinking Macca\u2019s coffee, not Coke.\nAs I pass St Vincent\u2019s Hospital I see people social distancing outside the ER. A man walks a woman with a zimmer-frame to a black Jeep with its hazards on. The sky is now the ever slightest shade of blue.\nI took time off work. A concerned colleague (another of the lucky 14.8%) recommended an online program based on cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), developed by THIS WAY UP, part of the Clinical Research Unit for Anxiety & Depression at St Vincent\u2019s.\n\u201cPeople with insomnia often spend excessive time in bed in an effort to catch up on sleep or give themselves more opportunity to sleep,\u201d explains Dr Elizabeth Mason, senior clinical and research psychologist at THIS WAY UP. \u201cThe problem is that more time in bed doesn\u2019t actually lead to more sleep. It leads to frustration.\u201d\nShe adds, \u201cA major aim of CBT-I is to help the patient retrain your brain and body so that the bed once again becomes associated with calmness and sleep.\u201d This is done in part by restricting time awake in bed \u2014 gruelling but corrective.\nThrough the course and Lisa\u2019s therapy, I gained a healthier grip on my insomnia. I learnt that stirring in your sleep is nothing to pathologise. To worry long before bedtime. To get up after 20 minutes of not sleeping, do something non-stimulating in the other room, then try again.\nMoreover, I learnt that insomnia is like a very shit bedtime story. You tell it to yourself every night, that tonight will be terrible, and it is. But by slowly rewriting it, night by night, the story changes.\n\u201cSpeaking from both professional and personal experience, there is hope,\u201d says Tim. \u201cCBT is very effective.\u201d\n\u201cSleep deprivation may cause irritability, reduced concentration and motivation,\u201d says Lisa. \u201cHowever you cannot die from lack of sleep.\u201d\nThere are some nights I just don\u2019t sleep. And that\u2019s okay. I no longer read them as a catastrophe. Instead, I go to the other room, or out, for a walk.\nI silently thank the clinic as I pass by. The pink patina of dawn drapes itself over the Sydney skyline. The first few birds \u2014 currawongs and lapwings \u2014 call out from still dark trees, \u201cI am here! Here I am!\u201d\nAn Ausgrid sub-station hums. Its electricity makes a smoothie inside a terrace house. A cop sits in the passenger seat of a parked police car, his face lit up by Candy Crush.\nThere\u2019s no emergency here.

You either ignore it, soldier on and suck it up, or bombard yourself with sunshine and puppies and positive affirmations.\n\u201cCheer up!\u201d, \u201cDon\u2019t worry!\u201d, \u201cBe happy!\u201d \u2014 we seem to have a tacit discomfort in our society with discomfortable emotions. So much emphasis is placed on the pursuit of happiness, the lionizing of positive emotion, that it sidelines a full two-thirds of the six basic emotions we can feel \u2014 those being sadness, anger, disgust, and fear. As a result, when we feel the so-called \u201cnegative\u201d emotions, we often don\u2019t know how to feel about them, or what to do when we encounter them in others.\nIn other words, we\u2019re shit at feeling shit.\nSince 2020, I\u2019ve been running a small project called \u201cThoughts For The Dark\u201d that collects the hard-won thoughts that\u2019ve helped people through, well, shit times. This will come as no surprise, but phrases like \u201cDon\u2019t worry!\u201d or \u201cBe happy!\u201d or \u201cCheer up!\u201d have not yet appeared in anyone\u2019s submission. That\u2019s because blind positivity can\u2019t contend with the 24/7/365 shit-stream that is life.

She felt consumed with grief and loss \u2014 the unshakable feeling that her father never got to celebrate the adult woman she had become or see and experience the adult woman she would continue to be. She didn\u2019t know what to do with herself. Where others offered kind words and well wishes and positive thinking, like bandaids, it was one of May\u2019s \u201cmost down-to-earth friends\u201d who offered the opposite \u2014 reality.\n\u201cIt\u2019s shit now,\u201d May\u2019s friend said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s probably going to be shit for a while.\u201d\nThere was a pause. \u201cBut I can promise that it will be less shit, one day.\u201d\nThis stark and stoic acknowledgment of the shit-ness of the situation helped May immeasurably. \u201cSometimes just acknowledging the pain and darkness for what it is can be enough to set you free,\u201d says May. \u201cAnd is often a lot easier than the effort required to dismiss or change the way you feel.\u201d\nAnd one day, true to her friend\u2019s word, it was less shit.\nAlly Poole was 37 with two young kids, when she was diagnosed with stage 3 Hodgkin Lymphoma.

Some days, she couldn\u2019t reach out for her anti-nausea medication because of how nauseous she felt just by reaching for it.\nAlly shared her story on Instagram and would get comments like \u201cChin up!\u201d, \u201cYou\u2019re doing great!\u201d, \u201cLook on the good side!\u201d and, to her, worst of all, \u201cYou\u2019re my hero.\u201d\nWhat would Ally have rather someone said?\nSpeaking on a recent television program, Ally said \u201cWhen you\u2019re going through something like that, sometimes you just need someone to say \u2018This is really awful.\u2019\u201d\nShe says that all those \u201cKeep positive!\u201d comments made her feel the opposite \u2014 they made her feel guilty. \u201cI had survivor\u2019s guilt,\u201d she says. \u201cThat I should be positive because someone else has it so much worse.\u201d\nAsked what words she would\u2019ve wanted to hear, she has three:\n\u201cThis is shit.\u201d\nThe instinct to pretend you don\u2019t feel shit, ignore the shit, need to feel immediately better when you feel shit, or make other people feel immediately better when they feel shit, is perhaps misguided and more harmful than intended.\nPerhaps the wiser advice is to sit with the shit.\nWhy?\nIt might be helpful to think of shitty feelings as though they\u2019re actual shit.\nIf you try to hold in weapons-grade diarrhea, if you don\u2019t let it pass through your stomach and intestines and bum parts, you\u2019ll end up rupturing a bowel or getting constipated and developing hemorrhoids.\nIn the same way, shit feelings have to work their way through your mental system, so that they may pass. You need to trust in the process that makes them decompose. You need to let them flush through you.\nIf you try to clench your mind\u2019s asscheeks, by soldiering on or trying to \u201cstop\u201d feeling shit or actively pushing those uncomfortable feelings down, paradoxically, you\u2019ll end up making yourself feel shitter.\nFeeling shit feels shitty. There\u2019s no way around it. But anecdotes like Ally\u2019s and May\u2019s seem to suggest that acknowledging the shit, accepting it, sitting with it, might just be the best thing to do.\nThere\u2019s no right way or wrong way to feel shit. You can mope, eat cheesecake, curl up, cancel plans, listen to Radiohead and cry and cry and cry. You don\u2019t have to feel any other way. The only important thing is that you actually feel it \u2014 because only then, one day, can you move on. \ud83d\udca9", "comment_count": 4, "like_count": 360, "created_time": 1645864923360, "comment": [{"user_id": "5550b5b919a0", "comment_time": 1645864923360, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "1d5588281e36", "comment_time": 1647288338835, "comment": "You are absolutely correct when you say that trying to ignore and bury negative feelings only makes things worse.

I blame my mum.\nOver the past eight years, my mum and I have played 566 games of this Scrabble-inspired mobile app together. For us, it\u2019s an easy way to connect when we\u2019re not physically with each other. In that time, I\u2019ve placed over 26,644 feet worth of the game\u2019s signature orange letter tiles, played 6,208 unique words, and skipped countless ads promoting everything from stressful puzzle apps to pickpocket-proof cargo pants.\nEight years is a considerable amount of time to spend doing a certain thing. And inadvertently, even though the act of playing Words With Friends is quite trivial, subconsciously, certain habits, strategies, and broader observations have sunk their way into my mind. And so, partly to convince myself that I haven\u2019t wasted all my time playing a pointless mobile app, I thought I\u2019d share some nuggets of wisdom one might feasibly derive from Words With Friends and apply to broader life. Let\u2019s go.\n1. It might be easier elsewhere\nHere\u2019s the scenario \u2014 you\u2019re trying to play a word somewhere on the board, maybe to snatch a juicy triple letter tile on a J worth 10 points. But no matter how many times you shuffle your letters or try to will words into existence, it just ain\u2019t working. You spend so much time focused on this one spot before realizing there\u2019s another section of the board you can play your J for equal impact, and with a little ingenuity, you score a word substantially higher than you would\u2019ve in the original bugbear.\nI think there\u2019s a somewhat powerful metaphor for life hidden in this rather specific gameplay quirk of Words With Friends \u2014 and it\u2019s this: You could be trying and trying to achieve something in a certain field, perhaps in your chosen career, a project, or in a certain relationship. But for some reason or another, it\u2019s hard, you aren\u2019t getting anywhere, or the squeeze ain\u2019t worth the juice. You feel stuck, stressed, depressed, a victim of the \u201csunk cost fallacy\u201d \u2014 the belief that because you\u2019ve poured so much time or effort into a certain endeavor that it\u2019d be folly to pull out now.\nBut inevitably, you reach a point of existential cataclysm in which you say, \u201cit shouldn\u2019t be this hard.\u201d And so you make a drastic change. You quit your job, change careers, pivot the project, stop hanging out with a certain friend, or break up with your partner. After some time to cool off, you devote your energy elsewhere (or in a slightly different way), in another pursuit, in another person, and find to your delight that it\u2019s just\u2026 easy. Things just work and keep working, well after the honeymoon phase of the new thing you\u2019re now into. You\u2019re still playing with the same letters, the same internal resources, but simply by applying them elsewhere in your life, you\u2019re able to make bounds where before there were just bumps.\nIt\u2019s a reminder that you have what you need inside you, it\u2019s just a matter of application. So if you ever find yourself stuck, ask, where else on the board could I look?\n2. Writing tip: Z\u2019s add zing\nIn Words With Friends, Z\u2019s are among the top-scoring letters alongside J and Q, worth a whopping 10 points. There\u2019s a good reason for this \u2014 despite being hard to use, Z is one of the most exciting letters you can use in everyday prose. It instantly adds zip, zing, zest, and pizzazz to whatever you\u2019re writing. That\u2019s because its short sharp sound can act as a zap of phonetic electricity in even the most mundane sentences. So if you want to zhuzh up your text, consider a well-placed word like glitz or ritz, zodiac, zombie, zoo, bamboozle, puzzle, quizzical, or fuzz, and see if it gives your writing the chutzpah it needs.\n3. Treat the elderly with kindness\nIf you\u2019re a cheapskate like me, you likely don\u2019t pay for the premium version of Words With Friends. This means, like me, you likely get bombarded with ad after ad after ad, after every move you make in a game. In the eight years I\u2019ve played Words With Friends, I\u2019ve noticed these ads skew toward what must be their primary audience \u2014 the elderly. Increasingly there are ads for life insurance, arthritis aids, and the aforementioned pickpocket-proof pants.\nBut there\u2019s also a significant chunk of ads for crypto exchange sites promising the possibility of millions, gambling apps like Bingo, Slots, and Solitaire offering to win \u201creal money,\u201d and other dodgy propositions like these.\nIt\u2019s a stark reminder that there are many people trying to cash in on the technological illiteracy or neophyte naivety of the older people who make up our society (as also evidenced by the rise in elder abuse). And so this should serve as a sober nudge to do the opposite \u2014 to treat the elderly (and generally, the more vulnerable among us), with kindness, patience, and respect, to see their value, hear them out, give them the benefit of the doubt. Because lord knows there are enough people out there trying to take advantage of them.\n\n4. A small word is just as good as a big word\nIn Words With Friends, just because you can play a long word, rarely does that mean it\u2019s the highest-scoring word you could play. Sometimes, small words do the trick. It\u2019s true outside of the game too \u2014 we\u2019re all guilty of the utilization of hyper-elongated and unnecessarily involuted language, often in the context of work, usually to sell our smarts. But a clear connection in normal speak can jut out just as well, if not better, because your counterpart isn\u2019t lost in word soup. Rather than the style of what you\u2019re saying, they\u2019re able to engage with the substance of it. Having a substantive point, something worth saying and not just florid, is harder but far more compelling and respect-earning. It\u2019s the difference between chewing gum and a meal. One tastes nice but does nothing \u2014 the other feeds you. So be a feeder.\n5. Show off mindfully\nThat said, there are times in playing Words With Friends when you play a cool word like derided or clockwise or peacock, that mightn\u2019t get you the most points but brings you a certain glee. Hell, I did it earlier with that damn neophyte word. Doing this all the time is self-sabotaging (that is, it lowers your score over time) and self-aggrandizing (that is, it\u2019s just trying to show off how clever you are to the other player), but peppered here and there, it can add some pep to stale gameplay.\nI think this is the correct way to show off in life too. The pursuit of cool things solely to flex to friends or family or colleagues is empty, bankrupting, and self-destructive if untamed. Unfortunately, it\u2019s lauded today, especially on social media. But if done responsibly, every now and then, by buying a nice bit of furniture or appliance, a bold and colorful piece of clothing, artwork, or rare sneaker, even a fancy meal out or holiday, and done as a self-expressive flourish, not a performance directed to others, it can bring you a disproportionate amount of well-earned joy. Perhaps even more if it\u2019s kept a secret just for you, or you and your partner. Bring these items and experiences into your life consciously and meaningfully, and they\u2019ll go much further than if they\u2019re brought in vacuously and self-aggrandizingly. Treat yo\u2019self with cake, but know that an all-cake diet is trouble.\n6. Qi is powerful\nAny Words aficionado knows that the little word qi is a lifesaver in a pickle. On a triple-letter tile that sucker easily pumps out a 30+ point word, 60+ if you\u2019re playing two words at once. Having played it so many times over the years, I was curious as to what this word actually meant. It turns out qi is a concept in Chinese philosophy, one I belligerently believed was spelled chi my whole life, and which I had a passing knowledge of via tai chi.\nQi refers to the psychophysical energies that permeate the universe \u2014 translated crudely as \u201cair.\u201d I\u2019m no Daoist, and so this description inevitably falls short of the complex nuance contained in this tiny word. But just as air flows in and out of us, so too do words and ideas and thoughts and feelings and other energies, from others into ourselves, then back out into others. My interpretation is that we are mere momentary carriers of consciousness, a greater emergent consciousness, that coalesces around us and through us. I know I stand to be corrected (please comment). Nonetheless, this two-letter word offers an exciting portal into a more poetic way to think.\n\n7. Sometimes you\u2019ve gotta open up the board\nFinally, there are times when you\u2019re playing a game of Words and you\u2019re in a bit of a stalemate. Neither player wants to play in a spot that will potentially mean the other player can use a triple-word or triple-letter tile. And so neither gives an inch, meandering around and building upon existing words, adding on S\u2019s or bricklaying on two-letter words to form dense word sardines. Sooner or later, someone has to open up the board and take a momentary loss for the greater good of the game.\n\u201cOpening up the board\u201d in life might look like asking a dumb question to spark a more honest or fruitful dialogue. Or admitting an error to a loved one during an argument to discuss what might have more deeply caused that error. Or being vulnerable with a partner (if they are trustworthy) in order to become closer. Or making a small compromise in a creative project so as to protect a more integral part of the vision. Or writing a page of shit to overcome writer\u2019s block. It\u2019s deliberately but temporarily \u201closing\u201d something, to gain more in the bigger scheme of things. We\u2019re hardwired to fear such losses, through a psychological quirk known as loss aversion \u2014 but leaning into the aversion can sometimes be the wiser thing to do.\nThis is just some of the knowledge you might realistically glean from Words With Friends. Of course, this is the first step, and application is another matter. But thinking consciously about the things you do, no matter how trivial-seeming, can be an enriching and worthwhile endeavor. After all, if you\u2019re doing something often in one part of your life, it isn\u2019t a stretch to apply those behaviors elsewhere.\nSo shuffle those letters, play qi against your mum, and skip those pickpocket-proof pants, knowing that doing so might just be helping you live a more enlightened life.\nIf you enjoyed this, I wrote a similar story a few months ago which extrapolated life advice from the popular computer game, The Sims.

Three or four decades ago, while our country was focused on construction, another economy then similar to ours in size and with a similar-sized population, South Korea, instead staked its future on technology and semiconductors. The facts speak for themselves: in 2000, Spain\u2019s GDP still exceeded that of South Korea, but over the last 20 years, while Spain has contracted on four occasions, South Korea has maintained an upward trend, and today, after overtaking Spain in 2013, its economy is the 10th-largest in the world. This evolution is no coincidence, and reflects the fact that technology has become the most important variable conditioning an economy, in more and more ways.\n\nToday, microchips and semiconductors are a fundamental part of our lives: they are to be found in all products that rely on electronics, and the current supply crisis due to the pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine is hitting many sectors hard. At the same time, making them requires skilled labor and is not particularly cost-sensitive, due to automation. For a country like Spain, where engineering talent is relatively abundant and the quality-price ratio of its graduates is beneficial compared to other neighboring countries, becoming a chip-manufacturing hub makes a lot of sense.\nHowever, attracting investment from the companies who make them will not be easy. We are talking about a complex and highly fragmented industry: The people who design chips are not the same as those who manufacture the machinery that in turn other companies use to make them, while yet others assemble and test them. In this value chain, distances are measured in nanometers, and the fewer the better: There is still a market for 15 nanometer chips, but cutting-edge one-nanometer chips are the name of the game.\nThe Spanish government\u2019s decision to support semiconductor manufacturing comes late, and the country lags far behind the United Kingdom, Taiwan, the United States, the Netherlands, and of course China, all of which have spent huge amounts of money on the technology over recent decades. In short, Spain is a newcomer trying to enter an industry that its rivals have understood as strategic for years. Can we do it? Yes, but it\u2019s not going to be easy.\nIf this strategy is to work and we\u2019re to see chip factories spring up and the growth of specialized employment in Spain, we\u2019re going to need the right partners. Spanish companies must use the government\u2019s money to attract and facilitate the right investment, with the right partners. At the moment, Spain does not appear in the plans the big players in this industry. To do so will require money and political will, as well as training and education and all that goes with establishing the right conditions for these types of companies.\nModernizing the productive fabric of a country doesn\u2019t happen by big announcements and strategic plans; they\u2019re fine as an expression of political will, but they need back up. Elon Musk, somebody who understands these things, responded to a Slashdot news item about the Spanish government\u2019s announcement by pointing out that while making chips is a great idea, Spain should really focus on solar panels and become Europe\u2019s main energy producer; something for which, by the way, there is another government strategic plan. If Spain can build solar panel components competitively \u2014 most are still made in China \u2014 and dedicate enough land to solar farms, while using it for other purposes, it could transform its economy. It\u2019s nothing short of ridiculous that as things stand, Germany is more committed to solar power than Spain, an anomaly that is largely a result of the stupidity of previous governments, which preferred to tax renewables instead of encouraging their development.\nThe question now is whether Spain can move from words to actions.\n(En espa\u00f1ol, aqu\u00ed)", "comment_count": 3, "like_count": 225, "created_time": 1649323797147, "comment": [{"user_id": "acfc0d77aeef", "comment_time": 1649323797147, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "83d8d3f3b3ef", "comment_time": 1649431152693, "comment": "germany also gets about 45% of its oil from russia. sometimes the e.u. is not working well as a 'united europe'."}, {"user_id": "83d8d3f3b3ef", "comment_time": 1649429676327, "comment": "last time i heard the expression 'political will' was rutger bregman referring to billionaires like elon in paying their fair share of taxes. musk is well-known en nevada for not paying his employees fairly, demanding long hours, and to top it off, he has water rights in a very dry state with a prolonged mega drought. espa\u00f1a wants him, they can have him imho and his teslas en space."}, {"user_id": "cb0e0358d08", "comment_time": 1649386782611, "comment": "I love this title."}], "post_tag": ["Semiconductors", "Industry", "Spain", "Solar Energy", "Engineering"]}, {"author": "Enrique Dans", "post_id": "26e206fe2c96", "user_id": "acfc0d77aeef", "title": "Are Formula 1\u2019s days numbered?", "content": "Are Formula 1\u2019s days numbered?\nIMAGE: Moritz Graf \u2014 Unsplash\nNissan has bought a team in Formula E, the FIA-sponsored electric single-seater racing category, joining other automakers for the eighth season of the environmentally friendly motor racing format. Maserati has also announced that it will compete in Formula E from next year, and the organization is also trying to get the legendary Ferrari to join.\nHowever, last year\u2019s winner, Mercedes, has announced that it will leave EV racing at the end of this season and focus on Formula 1, arguing it gives it more room for technology transfer. Renault left Formula E to focus on Formula 1 in the 2018\u201319 season.\nNevertheless, this raises questions about the future of Formula 1, originally designed as a way to test technologies and transfer them to mass market vehicles when that mass market is increasingly dominated by EVs in the run up to a ban on diesel and gasoline vehicles in many countries from 2030 onwards.\nFormula E\u2019s mission is to research and develop electric vehicles, promote them and increase their popularity, showcasing innovation within a framework that combines technology and sport. This makes sense at a time of rapid technological change, when all manufacturers need test beds and incentives to make their vehicles more competitive.\nAt the same time, some of Formula 1\u2019s innovations to do with chassis, aerodynamics, etc., are also applicable to EVs: as things stand, all Formula E teams must still use the same chassis, which greatly limits the innovations that can be incorporated, although they can mount any engine they like, within established limits.\nThe improvements being made in Formula 1 have for many years now been merely incremental, and aimed at a declining market whose days are numbered. What is the point of brands continuing to improve internal combustion engines, when they and the fossil fuels that power them are on the way out, while electric motors offer much better performance at all levels?\nAnd what about the fans of a sport traditionally associated with the smell of gasoline and the roar of engines when both become a thing of the past? The progressive limitation of the revolutions of internal combustion engines established by the FIA over time \u2014 which has changed the sound of engines \u2014 sparked protest, but was soon accepted, which shows that tastes can be changed, but will they also accept a change as radical as largely silent, odorless EVs?\nFormula E keeps the FIA\u2019s options open, and the organization is helped by the decision of more and more marques to compete in it. However, the fact that others are abandoning it probably reflects another problem: that there isn\u2019t enough money to be made in Formula E yet to lure them away from the advertising revenue in Formula 1. At what point will the FIA decide to support more environmentally friendly motorsports and make a serious commitment to Formula E and accept that the research and development side of Formula 1 makes little sense for a technology that is all but obsolete?\n(En espa\u00f1ol, aqu\u00ed)", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 52, "created_time": 1650015455729, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Formula 1", "Electric Car", "Electric Vehicles", "Research And Development", "Automotive"]}, {"author": "Enrique Dans", "post_id": "e322257eddf6", "user_id": "acfc0d77aeef", "title": "Is FIFA about to take over global soccer broadcasting?", "content": "Is FIFA about to take over global soccer broadcasting?\nIMAGE: Vienna Reyes \u2014 Unsplash\nFIFA has announced the launch of FIFA+, a proprietary streaming platform that includes documentaries, live matches and an archive of more than 3,000 historic games, available free of charge, with advertising.\nThe move has been interpreted as a trial run to cut out the middleman: better bandwidth has lowered the entry barriers for content broadcasting to such an extent that just about anybody can distribute and market their product on their own.\nFor the time being, competitions with previously negotiated rights, such as the upcoming World Cup in Qatar will not be available on the platform, and we will have to see what FIFA decides to do with the rights to other events. Content is already available in English, German, French, Spanish and Portuguese, with plans to add Mandarin, Bahasa, Korean, Japanese, Italian, Arabic and Hindi in a few months. FIFA predicts a global audience of 200 million users by the end of this year. In addition, it plans to produce news, statistics and a fantasy league. At launch, the service will broadcast about 1,400 matches per month, which will soon rise to 4,000.\nMight FIFA earn more from individual viewer payments than by selling the rights en bloc to television channels in different blocs around the world? Until now, broadcasting highly popular content such as soccer was a key revenue earner and way to attract subscribers; similarly, auctions of broadcasting rights provided clubs with income, a model that is in crisis as the big sides attempt to negotiate their rights separately and even organize their own competitions.\nA direct broadcast model would give FIFA total control over revenue without having to rely on auctions of its content, allowing it to better manage transfers to clubs.

At the same time, research continues into how to create a more effective metaverse, where such exchanges can be conducted in a more advantageous way than in the so called \u201creal life\u201d.\nAccenture has built a virtual environment on Microsoft Mesh called The Nth Floor, where employees can meet each other, interact or hold meetings, as well as engage in leisure activities, and even play golf. The company has purchased 60,000 Meta Quest 2 viewers for its employees so that, in an environment where more and more of its staff work from home or wherever they want, they can share common spaces and take part in activities that keep them in touch with each other.\nWhile companies still obsessed with micromanagement are demanding their employees return to the office, threatening layoffs or salary cuts if they don\u2019t, others are trying to create immersive environments where people like Bill Gates say most of our work meetings will take place. In other words, a new approach to labor relations, subject, of course, to the usual hype cycle, but adoption of which will depend on how certain companies intend to monopolize it.\nFacebook can change its name to Meta and try to clean up its appalling reputation, but the metaverse is not the video game created on Unity that Zuckerberg wants. Instead it\u2019s going to be an environment where a range of players will drive innovation. Experiments like Horizon Worlds may give us a glimpse of the possibilities of immersive environments that have barely evolved little since the Second Life era, but the metaverse has much greater potential, has many more implications and, above all, in no way is compatible with the advertising exploitation model that a company like Meta has in mind (the consequences of which we all know too well).\nIn any case, it is worth noting how some companies are already creating environments for their employees and where in the not-too-distant future, they will be able to meet clients or access documents, etc. For many people, the metaverse is still an entelechy, an unhealthy or even dystopian vision.

Not only that, but a dance that requires a huge amount of discipline and skill. These are how I would describe Buler\u00edas.\nBuler\u00edas are a style of flamenco that hooked me in from the beginning, and are quite possibly the sole reason I quit my life in London to live in a traditional town in the South of Spain. There are over fifty other types of flamenco, or palos (sticks), as they call them in Castilian Spanish, but Buler\u00edas are a real characteristic of Jerez de la Frontera. Buler\u00edas were born for dancing, but just as important is the accompaniment of the singer, guitarist and the rapid clapping known as \u201ccomp\u00e1s\u201d. It is so mind-bendingly complex that this article will barely scratch the surface. And I am far from an expert.\nTo get a basic sense of what Buler\u00edas are, here is a short film I made with a dear friend a few years ago. Nuria Mercedes was a woman from Madrid who moved to Jerez, like me, giving up everything, job security, a sense of self even, to study the art of flamenco. Mercedes, as she was known by her friends in Jerez (Nuria by her friends from Northern Spain) studied for twenty years in Jerez, and dedicated herself mostly to the cante (flamenco song). Mercedes was an artist with \u201cgracia\u201d. Gracia is the word they use in Andalusia for a person who is graceful but also funny\u2014a kind of devilish cheekyness.\nBuler\u00edas, part 1, with Nuria Mercedes\nMercedes passed away last year. The loss of her was painful, but her friends were comforted by the fact that she had been living the life she always dreamed of in Jerez.\n(Subscribe to En Casa de Mercedes if you\u2019d like to see the rest of the films, which I am currently re-working).\nJerez is, in my opinion, the best place to learn Buler\u00edas. The intrigue and frustration is that if you learn Buler\u00edas anywhere else, you will get little respect from a person in Jerez that has grown up dancing them since they were able to walk. Even if you have studied a minimum of ten years with teachers from the old flamenco dynasties of Jerez, you may just about elicit an eyebrow raise of approval from the local aficionados. Let me also say that the approval of the Jerezano Buler\u00edas aficionados doesn\u2019t discriminate \u2014 you could be an international flamenco star with sold-out shows around the world, or a foreign nomad with nothing \u2014 but if you have not grown up dancing it in the flamenco barrios of Jerez, you will never truly know it (so they say).\nThere are, of course, exceptions, and any person brave enough to step up to dance the Fiesta por Buler\u00edas at the end of a \u201cjuerga\u201d (flamenco party) will be cheered on \u2014 so long as they maintain the rhythm. I myself have only felt brave enough to do a few classes in the past year just as we began to move out of the pandemic. I therefore have a very rudimentary grasp of the rhythm and know only a few steps. One factor in my favour is that I have only ever known Jerez Buler\u00edas. I am unspoilt by any outside influences or what would be seen as \u201cbad habits\u201d.\nMy teacher validated this by telling me, kindly, that I dance like a Jerezana. My teacher is from Japan and is one of the few well-regarded \u201coutsiders\u201d in the Jerez flamenco community, who dances Buler\u00edas with a real art, an understated elegance. Take into account that a flamenco \u201coutsider\u201d could be anyone a few hundred kilometers north of Jerez. So you may forgive me if 1) I have been incredibly cautious about learning Buler\u00edas myself and 2) I\u2019m incredibly nervous about writing this article, anxious I\u2019ll make some mistake or indiscretion about this coveted art.\nI first came to Jerez seven years ago whilst doing a practical residency with my art college. We were sent to Jerez to make a theatre project, though we weren\u2019t entirely sure why. Before going, I knew little of flamenco and nothing of Jerez, but it turned out to be fortuitous (and perhaps also ruinous) trip for me. When I saw my first Buler\u00edas dance, that was it. My old life melted away from me and I could not rest until I understood how it worked. My body jerked as if possessed, wanting to join in, at the very least with the clapping, but I couldn\u2019t conceive how I could recreate the complex 12-part rhythm. In the world of flamenco, outside of Andalusia (known as the crib of flamenco), the 12-beat comp\u00e1s (rhythm) is clapped on-beat, fast and with accents, but generally maintains the monotonal tack-a-tack-tack throughout.\nIn Jerez, Buler\u00edas are instinctively (though after years of practice) clapped out in layers of on-beat and off-beat counter-rhythms. As the dancer and singer warm-up, accelerating the tempo and energy, members of the audience call out the \u201cjaleo\u201d. These are sporadic, short expressions shouted out to encourage the artists. It is improvised, but highly-skilled, and there are strict frameworks in place to make it appear effortless, off-the-cuff. The \u201cpalmas\u201d (clapping) is an art in itself, as is the jaleo. The combination of these create the \u201csoniquete\u201d (groove/ sound) that Jerez Buler\u00edas are famous for. It is a soniquete that, as Mercedes says, is \u201cdiabolic\u201d in its rapidity, though imbued with a polished finesse.\nIf you want to geek out on the structure of the comp\u00e1s, I have provided a screenshot below from an amazingly helpful website, which includes the different types of Buler\u00edas comp\u00e1s you can hear in each region/ area. This is an example of how it is done in Jerez, and if you go to the website you can hear audios of the comp\u00e1s, as well as the guitar and cante.\nFrom the website of Anna Colom Tadeo\nFor the music readers out there, here is an example of how it looks in note form, from this also very helpful website (also in Castilian Spanish).\nFrom Flamencopolis\nFiesta por Buler\u00edas (Party Buler\u00edas!)\nFiesta por Buler\u00edas are the culmination of a show, or a juerga, where all the tension built from the players and viewers comes to a head. It explodes from the dancer, agitated by the singer, guitarrist, palmeros (professional comp\u00e1s-clappers) and audience. The dance is abandonment and elation, but highly skilled.\nBelow is an example of what a Fiesta por Buler\u00edas might look like, although it is played to the audience here, far from the familial-style of juerga that Buler\u00edas originate from. The dancer, Manuela Carpio, is from one of the \u201cgitano\u201d flamenco dynasties of Jerez (gitano is the word that Spanish Romani use to identify themselves). Manuela is also a skilled teacher, judging by the glowing reports of friends lucky enough to study under her.\nFiesta por Buler\u00edas de Jerez with the dance of Manuela Carpio\nAs I\u2019ve mentioned, the best kinds of Fiesta por Buler\u00edas are the ones you see in an intimate setting, if you\u2019re lucky enough to be in the right place at the right time. My first juergita (baby-juerga) was at a friend\u2019s house in the barrio (area) of San Miguel. They lived in a kind of quarters that had been repurposed from an old bakery. The courtyard was large, crumbling and open to the sky. In the courtyard were the remains of a huge, round, old bakery oven, which was even big enough for you to sit inside.\nThis is where I first met Mercedes. She sang for most of the night, and her voice, although not as powerful as the bellow of the cantaor (flamenco singer) often heard in flamenco, sounded as if it were from another era. It had this nostalgic quality \u2014 like the artful crackle of high-quality vintage records, yet authentically present. International people, who had come from all over the world to learn flamenco in Jerez, danced and played guitar through the night. As the bonfire sparked from an old oil drum, I looked at the stars above, wondering if I was dreaming.\nI have also had the privilege of encountering spontanous juergas after concerts in flamenco pe\u00f1as. Pe\u00f1as are beautiful old buildings preserved by the members of the community, where you can see flamenco concerts for free. The concerts are well attended and you are likely to spy local flamenco aficionados, who, moved by the spirit of the duende (literally translated as \u201cthe goblin\u201d) dance their own brand of Buler\u00edas at the end of the show.\nIn my early, eager days I used to film these on my phone, posting them on Instagram. For example, this fragment of a spontaneous juerga in the Pe\u00f1a Flamenca La Buler\u00eda in late 2018, with the cantaora Coral de Los Reyes. Another memorable moment was an elderly woman in the Pe\u00f1a Tio Jos\u00e9 de Paula, who, despite needing aid to mount the stage, triumpantly danced her Buler\u00edas por fiestas to an adoring public at the end of a concert.\nAnd herein lies what I love about Buler\u00edas in particular, that it is a dance for anybody, regardless of bodily capacity or shape, and that it changes in spirit and character with every person who performs it. I once saw a man who, beginning to dance Buler\u00edas, stopped elegantly, his hands in position. He then stood for a duration of around two minutes, stock still but in perfect comp\u00e1s. The tension was at a frenzy when he finally went to dance the final part, a cheeky little flounce off an imaginary stage. Now that\u2019s what you call \u201cgracia\u201d.\nWhat is Gracia?\nTo explain the concept fully, I\u2019d rather call on the expertise of Jerez-born flamenco artist, Pepe el Zorri. In the video he tells my friend Ana about what \u201cgracia\u201d is. This was recorded on a visit seven years ago when my Spanish was particularly basic (as were my camera skills).\nAna speaks to Pepe el Zorri about gracia\nIn the video Pepe mentions El Bo, a local \u201cfestero\u201d from a famous gitano flamenco family in Santiago, who sadly passed away in the years since this was filmed. A festero is someone who \u2014 rather like my friend Mercedes \u2014 can do a little bit of everything, and is the kind of animated person you need to liven up a juerga. Here is a little snapshot of El Bo and his \u201cgracioso\u201d style.\n\nPepe el Zorri is from a family of fishmongers in La Plazuela, another barrio in Jerez famous for its gitano flamenco families. After his wife died, he seemed to do the impossible, and in his 70s made what was once a hobby into a career. He is now an international touring flamenco dancer.\nPepe el Zorri has the fortune of being related to La Pacquera de Jerez, one of the most respected and greatest cantaoras of the last century. Indeed, her statue marks the entrance to the barrio of La Plazuela, where she was born. Although she died many years before I discovered Jerez, she haunts the barrio of San Miguel. When I moved to Jerez, I lived right next door to the house that La Paquera was born in, for a year and a half. I fell in love with her powerful voice, which seemed to blast every feeling of woe and grief from my body. That is her style, and indeed it this is what the soniquete of La Plazuela, or the barrio of San Miguel, is known for.\nMe and La Paquera, La Plazuela, Jerez de la Frontera, 2018\nBuler\u00edas of San Miguel and Santiago\nA 20 minute walk from San Miguel is the barrio of Santiago, also famous for its flamenco. Though it may seem absurd, there is even a divergence between the Plazuela-style of Buler\u00edas and those you might observe in Santiago. The Plazuela style is considered, \u201cjondo\u201d (profound, sorrowful), and Santiago as more \u201cfiesta\u201d, related to the juerga gitana. El Bo, a Santiago stalwart, is an example of this particular style.\nI have lived in the barrio of Santiago for the past year and a half, and as if by magic, I feel as if I am soaking up the sound. I find that these days I\u2019d rather listen to the gracioso-fiesta type of Buler\u00edas than the profundity of the soniquete that had previously gripped me in Plazuela. But I cannot forget my introduction to flamenco via La Plazuela, where many close friends lived, including Mercedes.\nI gift you a small introduction of La Paquera singing Buler\u00edas, transforming this intimate juerga with her powerful cante:\n\nOver the last four centuries, gitano families settled in Jerez to work as blacksmiths, fishmongers and basket-weavers, amongst other crafts. The barrios of Santiago and San Miguel traditionally had the highest population of gitano families, where flamenco was passed down from hand to hand, from mouth to mouth. Flamenco is known primarily as an art pertaining to the gitanos, although there are also a great deal of non-gitanos who have contributed to the legacy. Many modern-day flamenco artists in Jerez are from a mix of gitano and non-gitano families. La Paquera, the queen of flamenco, was herself of mixed heritage.\nBut what are they singing?\nMany Buler\u00edas \u201cletras\u201d (lyrics) deal with hardships. Each cantaor has an infinite store of these, which are like little limericks or ditties that have been recycled, passed down, and written anew.\nIn the letras sung by Mercedes in the very first video, she repeats:\n\u00a1Que tengo fr\u00edo y no tengo le\u00f1a!\nI\u2019m cold and I have no firewood!\nOther letras are more absurd and humourous. I will share another snippet of Pepe el Zorri to give you an idea. This is an example of him teaching Buler\u00edas letras to Ana:\nPepe el Zorri sings Buler\u00edas letras\nOne part of my own personal story I haven\u2019t yet shared are the two months I spent learning cante with the wonderful Carmen Tundidor Neira in 2015. She was a flamenco artist with a young daughter, a pregnant wife and many, many dogs. Her house was full of music and joy, but also the pinch of trying to make a living as an artist in Jerez. It was good fun, but also challenging for the both of us, since my Spanish was so basic as was my knowledge of flamenco and comp\u00e1s.\nCarmen taught me a good deal, with openness and warmth. I remember going through a particularly rough moment and having a panic attack; her rushing to get her wife, who promptly popped a pill in my mouth. I\u2019m not sure what it was but it instantly calmed me down. She told me that she grew up on the streets of La Plazuela playing the caj\u00f3n, a wooden box they play to keep the time of the comp\u00e1s, and that she played in juergas with the great Paquera.\nThese are some of the characteristically gracioso letras she taught me, well-known by many Jerez cantaores:\nTe lo dije una broma\nTan en serio lo has tomado\nQue por mi puerta\nNo asomas\nI told you a joke\nYou took it so seriously\nThat you no longer show up at my door\nI can relate quite strongly to that one.\nAnother one (although I think she slightly and rather saucily changed the words):\nCoge una silletita\ny si\u00e9ntate enfrente\nAunque no seas mi novia\na m\u00ed me gusta verte\nGrab a chair\nand sit opposite\nEven though you\u2019re not my girlfriend\nI like to look at you\nI will wrap up here, acknowledging that we\u2019ve barely scratched the surface of the world of Buler\u00edas, much less the world of flamenco and all its artists.\nHere is a link to the Those Who Were Dancing Youtube playlist to hear some more of the locals and greats of Jerez performing Buler\u00edas.\nArt to Mock the Rich?\nThe term Buler\u00edas is said to come from \u201cburler\u00eda\u201d (mockery) or \u201cbolero\u201d (deceiver). I was once told that it was called that because the gitanos danced for the rich whilst mocking them, and I love this idea, although it\u2019s not the party line in Jerez. It is said that Buler\u00edas originated in Jerez, but it is also said they originated in C\u00e1diz (a seaside town in the same province as Jerez). As you can probably tell, flamenco is an art riddled with contradictions and a great deal of folklore. It was in the latter part of the 20th century that Buler\u00edas became important, and apparently it wasn\u2019t even really considered flamenco or particurarly jondo before then, but more of a little warm-up to the more serious palos.\nIf legend has it, it wouldn\u2019t surprise me one bit if Buler\u00edas were truly crystallised in Jerez. Trust the Jerezanos to make an art out of the fiesta, and to find the profundity in humour.\nCollage by Matteo Delred\nAre you a MASSIVE fan of Those Who Were Dancing?

A lingering dissolution.\u201d\nAll That Falls, Samuel Beckett\nOh, the melancholy. When I found this quote, spoken by a character in one of Beckett\u2019s plays, it spoke to me. Particularly during the restrictions of Covid. I was in Spain and hadn\u2019t seen my family in Scotland and England for a while.\nBeckett was Irish but lived most of his life in Paris. Irish modern literature was the mecca of the exiles. Many Irish writers that I admire, including James Joyce and Edna O\u2019Brien, left Ireland in the wake of establishing itself as an independent nation, but couldn\u2019t stop writing about it. It haunted them, the Irish lilt never disappearing from their written English.\nIt\u2019s hard to not feel haunted by Ireland. My ancestors from the great-grandparents onwards were Irish, and certainly the literature and music grips me; its history fascinates me. I\u2019ve only been there twice, and both times a shiver went up my spine as I stood in the exact spot that the British army executed my great, great uncle, who formed an important part of the early uprisings for Independence.\nI can\u2019t say I feel entirely the same about London, where I\u2019ve lived the majority of my life. A lingering dissolution is certainly what I attach to that city. Full of remarkable history, for sure, but in my opinion, too big for its grimy boots. I do miss bits of it. The fact that you could hear thousands of languages in one day, walking down a high street or through a market. The amazing falafel wrap I\u2019d get for a fiver in New Cross on the way home. The veggie curries on Drummond Street. The big walks from Walthamstow Wetlands down the canal to Hackney. The fact that you could see, plain as day, that normal London folk were being chased out of their areas by development and the influx of yuppies, yet there were still communities organising and fighting back. Radical, inner-city community spaces, full of colourful banners and alternative art, got by on donations but hung on by a thread.\nIn Whitechapel, the East End of London, where I\u2019d hear the call to prayer in the afternoons as I walked back from work.\nIn Stratford, where new unaffordable homes shot up, along with the Olympic park sculpture, which loomed over the area with one of the highest levels of homelessness in Britain.\nIn New Cross, nestled amongst the old Edwardian houses and flats where poets and musicians flourished, but women have the lowest life expectancy compared to any other London Borough.\nWhy is being at home \u201ca lingering dissolution\u201d? I imagine parts of myself falling away, moulding myself into the expectation of whatever was created before. London has the sensation that it is constantly dissolving and growing from the rubble, reinventing itself. That\u2019s what we see when we peer into the past: the anarchist squats, riots, punks, the clashes between fascists, socialists and new waves of immigrants. But the edgy areas we mythologised, like Brixton, Camden, or Hackney, begin to look uniform. The numbers of hipster barista bars now equivalent to the numbers of homeless. Me and my creative friends living in box rooms whilst knocking back antidepressants, or self-medicating.\nLondon was the place that formed me, my accent, my overbearing passive aggressive politeness, quickly turned to rage if things weren\u2019t efficient enough. Don\u2019t judge me \u2014 that is the London character, and I am shaking it off. But in London I was a bag of nerves. The city felt too big. I tried to make friends with the neighbours wherever I moved (5 times in 5 years), but it wasn\u2019t the norm. My directness was treated as if it were a mental illness.\nI spent the other part of my life in Scotland; Glasgow specifically, where my family are from. Glasgow was London\u2019s warmer cousin; in character, certainly not weather. I romanticise this city, the dusky glens and proud gloomy mountains nestled around it. Everything felt softer there despite the grey rain which got into your bones during the winter. I fell in love for the first time in Glasgow. I dressed myself in the scratchy old fabrics and bright colours of the vintage shops, tucked in forgotten corners.\nI have never seen as many fights and street violence as I did there. I have never had to run so fast to find safety, heart pounding. There I studied Literature and Theatre in a building that looked like Hogwarts, and dreamed I could be something one day. I lived in many types of houses and flats, making friends with the mice that ran under Kelvinbridge. I spent my adolescence vomiting under bridges, thinking that poisoning myself with alcohol would make me happier, as so many others in the city do.\nGlasgow is where I first started working properly. The gruff greetings and banter clashed with my hesitant, curt vowels. Whilst my idea of a conversation was a halting, two-way metronome, the tendency in that part of the word seemed to be taking turns to bellow out anecdotes and jokes. On the first day of a job working in a music and theatre venue, the senior manager\u2019s opening line to me was, \u201cWho the fuck are you?\u201d My heart jumped out of my ribcage. But it was friendly enough, I think. I got used to this, the \u2018cunts\u2019 and \u2018fucks\u2019, flung out without pre-meditation. Always friendly enough, but at times, tinged with a shadow of threat. I could never quite catch the rhythm. I got a job at a gentile department store and was promptly fired for telling a colleague to go fuck himself\u2013genuinely, quite innocently. I didn\u2019t understand that the war-talk of bars and kitchens didn\u2019t translate to the shop front.\nI always got on with the folk of hotter climes. My passion and intensity for subjects felt appreciated, not out of place. My curt politeness was appreciated, and reciprocated with a warmer style of hospitality. I finally found myself in Andalusia. I was enticed by the music and culture. I could finally learn Castilian Spanish but live in a place that was less recognisably Europe, dusted in the remains of a Moorish Empire from the Middle Ages.\nBut as Beckett\u2019s character says, living abroad results in a kind of suicide. I refer to it as ego death. Whatever country you move to, you will complain about the bureaucracy. It\u2019s overly efficient, overly invasive, or it\u2019s chaotic and illogical. The Spanish bureaucratic system certainly falls into the latter category. However, when we enter a new country, we are not only learning the language, the systems, the manners, and the customs, we are learning how to re-form and re-frame ourselves within a new currency of time and understanding. You can learn the grammatical structures until you\u2019re blue in the face, but at times you will still fail to communicate, or be understood. It\u2019s not about understanding what happens when, or who you should talk to where, because no one will think of telling you. Even to naturalise yourself as a citizen is a wild goose chase of half truths and gossips, frantic Whatsapps to any foreigners you may happen to have met.\nYou will spend the first period of your time there speaking like a child (which will go on much longer than you expect), hyperventilating in offices, never quite being sure if someone is helping you or mocking you. You will not know if the friends you made that live there are really truly your friends, or are taking pity on you; seeing you as an exotic creature. This is ego death. Your bones are jelly and they are slowly being twisted and re-moulded into something new. You will sometimes meet expats from your own country, and it\u2019s a relief not to be potentially misinterpreted (for a short while), but this will feel mostly like a strange, dissociative experience. You are each untethered and unbound. You cannot anchor each other. The longer you stay in the country, the further you grow from the familiar customs of your native land. You look into the face of loved ones, speaking your mother tongue, and realise you are talking a different language. You imagine that you seem odd to them\u2013the way you dress, eat or smell.\nDespite this, walking down the stone cobbled streets of an Andalusian street, inhaling air spiced with the scent of orange trees does alleviate the intensity. It is, as they say, \u201cvale la pena\u201d (worth the pain). Sometimes I truly don\u2019t know who I am, as my synapses crack and whip against each other, wriggling slowly, clumsily making new connections. But truly, it\u2019s the life I chose. And if familiar circumstances make you go to pieces, why not experience that somewhere else and learn new things as you crumble?\nInterestingly, Beckett said that he wrote in French because \u201cit was easier to write without style\u201d and because in English, \u201che couldn\u2019t avoid writing in poetry\u201d. I see the logic in this. I have the same tendencies, although with different objectives. Beckett was writing a type of prose that aimed for the bare bones of meaning, stripping away floridity and fluff. I, on the other hand, feel that we live in an age so sparing of tenderness we need a bit of poetry. I am not yet confident in Castilian Spanish, but am tentatively beginning to write in the language, mostly practicing using prepositions correctly, and which verbs take the subjunctive form. I am accepting it takes time to master. I\u2019m also discovering the beauty of simplicity.\nI leave you with the first poem I wrote in Spanish (that is publishable). It\u2019s a genuine anecdote from a moment I experienced in a caf\u00e9 local to where I was living.\nEn La Plata\nEn el barrio La Plata\nUn abuelo me conseja\n\u201cT\u00f3mate tomate,\ncome to\u2019 sin grasa\u201d\nMientras hablaba\nMir\u00f3 hacia arriba\nA su nieta que\nEn el cielo se encontraba\nMe mir\u00f3 y rez\u00f3\nlas manos enfrente\nPidiendo al dios\nPa cuidarla\nEnglish Translation:\nIn the neighbourhood, The Silver\nA grandfather advises me,\n\u201cEat tomato,\nEverything without fat\u201d\nAs he spoke\nHe looked up\nTo his granddaughter who\nWas in the sky\nHe looked at me and prayed\nHands in front\nAsking God\nTo take care of her\nI don\u2019t share this with you because I think it\u2019s a particularly great poem, but because it\u2019s a reminder that the simplest ideas come from intuition.

The otherworldly luminescence of C\u00e1diz province was dulled to the greyish tinge of my home country. It was like being without your glasses. I didn\u2019t mind it so much. Whilst I love to be in a sunny country, I enjoy the permission to be miserable sometimes. The gloom of my heart feels better rested when it matches the sky. I have some respite.\nToday the winter sun had resurfaced. Slowly coaxing out the freckles of my yoghurty complexion. \u201cPale and interesting\u201d, my aunties used to say. It was before Spanish class and I had come to my usual morning spot by the sea, gasping in the air and releasing the itch of my hands. Another victim to the plague of incessant phone-checking. Also hives. The gulls nagged above, like petulant adolescents. Men very slowly, like there really was all the time in the world, waddled into the shallow rock pool, waders pulled up over their knees. They bent from the waist and fiddled lovingly with the rocks. I guessed they were picking crabs but I googled it and it\u2019s not the season. It could have been muscles. Two or three men were dotted around the rocks. Dancing with the sea. I reached out to touch the water but there was a dip where the sand stopped and I had to be careful. There was a slope and I slid a little. Stones in my red-purple shoes. I retreated. It was time for class.\nJust as you come out of the little beach \u2014 which had a long stone bridge jutting out, leading to a ruin you couldn\u2019t visit \u2014 there was a pe\u00f1a. This is a kind of venue for music, lunch or perhaps flamenco. People sat outside drinking little beers. On the other side sat a man in a wheelchair. He was in his customary corner. He was very brown. Every time the sun had been out I\u2019d seen him there. He didn\u2019t have many teeth and was unkempt and scrawny. He always had a big smile. A young man was sitting beside him on the old stones. He was very tall and muscular. Their heads were inclined to each other, their bodies in harmony. They talked deeply and with joy. I heard what must have been the rustle of a portable radio playing classical music. It danced with the sand in the air and the cries of gulls.\nWhat is art?\nThe older I get the more liberal my understanding of art has become. The scene I painted is art. Erm\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s not to do with how I described it, but because at that moment it was how I experienced it. When I was younger I would have probably described art as paintings in the gallery. As I grew up and got to know theatre, performance art and an experience of live music that transcended screens and music videos, my understanding expanded.\nI need to hold on to the moments, like that morning, as much as possible because my mind has been clouded, even wounded by my attempts over the years to understand art better. I studied it to Masters level. The Masters taught me so much. It taught me to suffer. It taught me that if you wanted access to the art world you needed to be constantly broke, disappointed and rejected. It helped me live out the Dostoevsky Crime and Punishment fantasy, or whatever dystopian, depressive novel or film takes your fancy.\nI recently went off social media because I wanted to get off the hamster wheel. The curated allure of a bohemian, artistic life. As if the poetry I shared was imminent to be put on a sticker or a mug. The constant comparison. When my brain switched away from thinking about just making something, to how it could be manifested as \u201ccontent\u201d, something in me finally snapped. I suddenly saw clearly the reams and reams of work I\u2019d spent hours making appear on the feed of someone who\u2019d been possessed.\nIt wouldn\u2019t be like a sharing of your work\u200a\u2014\u200aa room of people together, touching shoulders, looking into each other\u2019s eyes then quickly away again. Because that\u2019s not how we interact with art on social\u00a0media. We want so desperately to be inspired that we will feast on every mesmerising image and story frisbeed onto our screens. A minute later it\u2019s gone, and the more we take in the more the eyes glaze over. Artists are creating free content for corporate giants every day, and it is being \u201cconsumed\u201d by a big-toothed chomping monster algorithm machine.\nI once had a stint working as a theatre critic. I wanted to see shows for free and I had a razor sharp eye for the details. I began to dislike my privileged position. How could I judge a performance that had been showered with cash against another that was created on a shoestring in the local community? I knew I didn\u2019t like the ones I was supposed to like and I resented that I was supposed to like particular things, depending on my algorithm.\nI once brought a kind-of performance-song piece to an anarchist place in Sweden. I remember drunkenly swigging vodka in the snow in Stockholm and arguing with my host about art criticism. Him for; me against. He was a professor at a university. We were about to go to a party where everyone was thin and well-dressed and knew about art. He didn\u2019t reply when I later emailed him to propose bringing over another performance.\nSo the art critic has been democratised. We are all the algorithm. Do you like your position and privilege and power? Do we really know the stories behind the content that has been created? Can we tell if it\u2019s good because of the likes and the pleasing symmetry? Do you feel comfortable judging who does and doesn\u2019t deserve it? True \u2014 better than the pointy-shoed, polo-shirted guy called Giles who owns a gallery in Soho.\nI don\u2019t and won\u2019t ever be able to tell you what art is, or what is deemed worthy and what isn\u2019t. My dad always says that he isn\u2019t interested in art, he\u2019s interested in ideas (he says it so often that my brother and I finish the sentence and roll our eyes). He is an artist. I do agree. It\u2019s why I left social media. I needed to claw back my harvest of ideas. They were a kamikaze of seedling-imitations, implanted by what I was consuming.\nCan we cast judgment on a seed before it\u2019s begun to sprout out of the soil? I see other humans and their appreciation of art, poetry and music like a large, wild field. I want to disseminate and grow a garden with them; overgrown, savage, full of weeds. Facebook, Instagram, Twitter etc. are the filthy swamp full of toxic chemical waste on the other side of the gate. I sigh when I see every seed of an idea rolling slowly towards the churning matter. It mutates. It can no longer flower, it has no life beyond.\nA fragment from Homage to Catalonia, George Orwell\nDo you want to support my writing?

It was full of school books, pictures, letters, and tokens. It broke my heart.\nThere was some upheaval in my family. People and possessions were being uprooted; things were being left behind. I had the option of taking my belongings back to where I lived, which was an abandoned psychiatric ward on the outskirts of London. But this place (unsurprisingly) didn\u2019t feel like home, and I was living the typical artist, low-wage experience of very little personal space, no home security and a lack of trust for my neighbours. I grit my teeth as I saw my quirky little notes and early signs of promising creativity float into the dumpster. I think I did it to spite myself. I put great effort into not holding onto objects as they always seemed to slip away from me, whether it was through carelessness or circumstance.\nWhen I was a child, I would have feverish dreams and nightmares. My toys would come alive and march up and down the room. They were malevolent and I didn\u2019t trust them. In a time of pre-teen idealism I had my own room and painted it bright orange. I had lots of trinkets but the only thing I remember was a chirpy, eccentric coloured-glass clock with springy hands. I had that room for a few years but I moved on again in rather sad circumstances. For the next twenty years of my life I moved around a lot, even when it seemed I had a choice not to. Deep within me I felt that to keep safe you had to keep moving, so objects became de facto, a low priority. That\u2019s not to say I don\u2019t like things. Interesting materials, patterns and colours. A few years ago I treated myself to some brown patterned 70\u2019s vintage coffee cups. They were probably owned by a dead lady from Walthamstow in North-East London, where I bought them. I still have a couple of these cups left, I think I gave my mother the others.\nI inherited my carelessness and tendency to lose things from my mother. It\u2019s why I never wear my wedding ring, a family heirloom of my husband\u2019s that belonged to his great-grandmother. It\u2019s the only thing of value I own. From my dad, I inherited the \u2018moving-on\u2019 mentality. Every time we\u2019d get the train over to Scotland to see him, my brother and I would be visiting a different type of house or flat. We\u2019d be meeting new, what-we-perceived-as kind faces. For this reason perhaps, one of my most treasured, worthless items is a postcard my dad sent to the former-psychiatric ward I was living in. To explain the background of this bizarre living arrangement, I needed to find cheap accommodation fast just as I was starting art school in London. My friend, an opera director, had moved into a Guardianship property. These are buildings owned by public or private property owners, which have fallen out of use. They are usually converted into flats and in the meantime leased out to people looking for \u2018cheap\u2019 rent. In return the guardians will prevent homeless people or squatters from moving in. It was somewhat against my principles, but it was the only option I could afford.\nIt was fun at first, the panic buttons in the rooms, finding nail scratches in the doors and letters written by former disturbed patients behind the curved-glass mirrors which concealed defunct cameras. We were artists, musicians, circus performers, nurses, mechanics, even people with corporate city jobs saving up for a mortgage. We had a huge garden the size of a football field where we could have barbecues. Over time, my youthful optimism waned. There were thieves in the building (lucky I didn\u2019t own much), fights, tensions. I saw people lose their mind in a former mental hospital that still had the pictures of nurses hanging up in the corridor. A man took up camp in the living room where we used to have vegetarian communal meals and spoke to his dead grandmother. People came back trying to commit their relatives, or former patients would break in. I moved into a room formerly inhabited by a witch in a quieter part of the building. The wall had been blackened, by spells and candles I supposed, so I painted over it with white paint and childish illustrations\u200a\u2014\u200athe type I would have liked to have been able to paint in my teenage bedroom.\nLife was bleak at that time. On the postcard my dad sent, he had written, \u201cthe gypsies came and used my heart to make white necklaces and rings\u201d, which was more or less a translation of a poem by Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca. The original words were from Lorca\u2019s Gypsy Ballads:\n\u201cif the gypsies came I would make necklaces and white rings with your heart\u201d.\nLorca was a poet from Andalusia who collected the folklore of Spain, and was part of a monumental effort to boost and celebrate flamenco, the music of the gitanos. Whilst I understand the problematic nature of using the word, \u201cgypsy\u201d, I cannot erase it from this context, as in Castilian, Spanish gypsies refer to themselves as \u201cgitanos\u201d due to the complexity of their origins and histories, their roots being a mix of many ethnicities, including Sephardic Jews, Indians and Arabs who settled in Spain in the middle ages and even longer before. At the time, I dreamed of escaping from London to Andalusia (a dream I have happily now realised), the home of Lorca and flamenco, two loves that my father and I share.\nWriter\u2019s image\nWhen I went to stay for some months in the city of Jerez de la Frontera seven years ago, little did I know how hard I would fall for it, and flamenco too. My dad had done the same thirty years previously, although he had been staying in Madrid with my mother. Thereafter, anytime I could get money together, I would escape to Jerez and stay with friends\u200a\u2014\u200aartists who had abandoned their lives to learn flamenco. When I received this postcard from my dad, who was holidaying with his sisters in Lanzarote, I was transported from the grey sludgy streets of wintry London. I flew from the thick walls of my former psychiatric cell. At times of real hopelessness, it takes such moments of subtlety to lift us out. It was a mythology and a folklore. When my dad was young and misbehaving, his grandmother, an Irish immigrant who held the prejudices of her time, would say to him, \u201cyou\u2019ll go and run off with the gypsies.\u201d\nWhat else is special to me? A two-pound coin that my ex\u2019s dad stuck in a champagne cork after a tense New Year\u2019s Eve surprise visit. He and his son weren\u2019t getting on but he took a shine to me and loved that I smoke rollies. I am not entirely sure what this specific token means to me anymore. I only met him once but there was something so generous about the gesture I couldn\u2019t bear to throw it away.\nOnce, I was saying goodbye to someone and as I stood in their studio flat, full to the brim with trinkets, and curious objects of all epochs, I thought I should take something to remember them by. I knew how much value they put into their objects and so I knew I had to be very careful. I looked at the tickets to the cinema and gigs scattered around the room. No\u200a\u2014\u200aI myself keep tickets to special events (though I eventually throw them away). Receipts? No. Slightly stalkerish. I caught sight of some loose euros. Well I knew they\u2019d come in handy one day. I conservatively selected a 50-cent piece and stuck it in a special place in my purse. They would never know, but I would.\nI lost that 50 cents. Perhaps I spent it on coffee by mistake. I am not sure it matters. But it matters to me that I remember. It matters to me that I put little importance into big or expensive things, and a huge deal into objects that to others are utterly meaningless.\nDo you want to support my writing?

In fact, just this week neuroscientists discovered what they\u2019re calling \u201czombie\u201d brain cells, which only turn on after you die. (They are glial cells, and they are supposed to clean up the mess after a stroke or other trauma \u2014 they get to work immediately following death, even if their work is ultimately futile).\nThe space between your ears turns out to be almost as elusive as the space between planets. One neurosurgeon, Robert White, actually considered himself a brain \u201castronaut.\u201d Your brain is indeed up to something all the time, in often surprising ways. Here are five of the most astounding.\n1. You can survive with only half your brain.\nThe brain presents us with a curious paradox. It\u2019s responsible for all we think, all we do, and much of what we are. It is necessary to our every function; we might even say it\u2019s what makes us us. Yet we can seemingly get by on just half a brain \u2014 or even less. How do we explain this mystery?\nThe first human hemispherectomy was performed in 1923 at Johns Hopkins Hospital, when surgeon Walter Edward Dandy set about to remove a tumor and, in cutting out the cancer, took out half his patient\u2019s brain. The patient recovered and, to his doctor\u2019s delight, apart from losing the full use of the hand opposite the removed hemisphere, life proceeded mainly as before.\nEncouraged by this shocking success, Dandy attempted five more hemispherectomies on patients suffering from brain cancer. Before long, Canadian neurosurgeon K.G. McKenzie discovered hemispherectomy could cure epilepsy too. It was enough to turn the once-rare surgery into a mainstream treatment, but no one seemed to know why the surgery worked or how life could possibly go on so normally afterwards. It turns out that the brain is very flexible \u2014 what we call plasticity. Most patients carry on much as they did before with the exception of some muscle weakness (and very rarely, alien hand syndrome, where the patient\u2019s hand seems to have a mind of its own). Half a brain is enough!\n2. Your brain can physically paralyze you.\nIn a recent book by Suzanne O\u2019Sullivan, Sleeping Beauties, she describes a number of peculiar illnesses. In one, a patient named Tara had lost the use of her legs and one arm after injuring a disc in her back. There was just one problem; according to all medical scans, her nerves had not been damaged at all. Tara explained that she could \u201cfeel the disc move\u201d when she tried to use her limbs, but doctors told her is was psychosomatic. But what does that mean? We have a tendency to think it is a psychological condition. In fact, the brain \u2014 as arbiter of all things in the body \u2014 determines how you move, when you move, and if you move.\nThe pain had caused Tara\u2019s brain to stop letting her move body parts, making them seem numb. If that seems impossible, consider the case of resignation syndrome, which causes a person to sleep and not to wake up again (sometimes for years!) all while showing a normal brain scan. Tara learned to walk again, but it was slow going. It turns out that the brain can be taught to walk \u2014 and can also force you to unlearn those very same skills.\n3. Stroke victims are capable of generating new neurons to reverse paralysis.\nIn a landmark Lancet article released earlier this year, stroke survivors who received vagus nerve stimulation \u201crelearned\u201d how to move their arms. How was such a thing possible? Those receiving the nerve stimulation had a wire inserted into their neck that wrapped around the vagus nerve.\nCharles Liu, the lead neurosurgeon of the study and director of the USC Neurorestoration Center, explained it this way: stimulating the nerve caused the brain to make or release new neuromodulators \u2014 and because the patients were \u201clearning\u201d (or re-learning) a movement at the same time, it strengthened motor circuits in the brain. The patients were able to use arms and hands that had been paralyzed for years, with nothing more than a stimulation of their own brains. These are exciting times for stroke research, and new studies may work to help epileptics.\n4. The \u201cplacebo effect\u201d works because your brain wants it to.\nPhoto by Danilo Alvesd on Unsplash\nIn pharmaceutical trials, researchers will often give a medicine to one group of people and a \u201cplacebo\u201d to another \u2014 a \u201csham physical intervention.\u201d Since a placebo is essentially pretend medicine, it shouldn\u2019t have any effect. Except sometimes it works. To be honest, medical science still isn\u2019t sure exactly how or why, but it\u2019s a bit like the interaction between mind and body described above (number 2). A neuro-biological relationship has taken shape, and the mind is affecting the physical body. In fact, some research suggests that the fake medicine activates the same biochemical pathways of the brain that are activated by drugs \u2014 because the brain thinks it is going to. In the words of Benedetti et al, Humans are endowed with \u201cendogenous systems\u201d that can be \u201cactivated by verbally induced positive expectations.\u201d It\u2019s more than positive thinking \u2014 it involves a ritual of treatment behavior. But the results have been enough to cause science to take notice \u2014 and to take care that positive placebo effects don\u2019t skew the drug trials!\n5. The brain can outlive the body.\nThis last comes from my research into the life and experiments of Robert White. In the late 1960s, he performed a brain isolation experiment. That means: he took out the living brain of a monkey, kept it alive by flushing it with blood and fluids, and then hooked it up to an EEG. The brain, without any body at all, was thinking.\nWhite Archive, Mr. Humble and Dr. Butcher by Brandy Schillace\nImages preserved of the surgery reveal a bizarre and yet strangely familiar sight. The brain\u2019s gelatinous mass doesn\u2019t hold much shape; a brain on a dissection table quickly flattens out. But suspended from White\u2019s apparatus, bathed in life-giving blood and cooled to avoid any damage, the monkey\u2019s brain appeared in textbook perfection. The convolutions offered a beautiful topography, the vessels and veins standing out clearly \u2014 still pumping, still full of vital fluids. It didn\u2019t look like gray matter at all, but flushed and pink. And more than this, the brain sent out electrical signals, just as any living brain inside any living body would do. The signals blipped at intervals, appearing as peaks and valleys on the EEG printout like the scratching needles of an earthquake on the Richter scale. By measuring fluids, White could tell that the brain was also consuming energy , \u201cfeeding\u201d itself on glucose. Biochemical reactions were ongoing to sustain cellular life \u2014 the brain cells lived.\nWhat would it mean to be a brain alive, alone, and without a body? That is much harder to say. But we can be sure that the brain\u2019s deep mysteries won\u2019t be solved anytime soon. Long may this baffling, powerful, endlessly fascinating three pound machine continue to beguile us.", "comment_count": 21, "like_count": 2292, "created_time": 1629752414059, "comment": [{"user_id": "4b85ed7d479f", "comment_time": 1629752414059, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "b5a4fb2707c2", "comment_time": 1632462098710, "comment": "The brain without body loses the consciousness.

She was arrested by the Starr County Sheriff\u2019s Office, charged with murder, and held on $500,000 bond. Her crime: a self-induced abortion. By Saturday, Lizelle had been released, however, as the District Attorney announced that the law had overstepped its authority. Why? Because though the Texas murder statute does apply to abortion cases, it exempts pregnant women who self-induce. This, and this only, has freed Lizelle.\nAbortion rights won in the 1973 landmark Roe vs Wade case continue to crumble around the country. Lizelle\u2019s arrest is a consequence of Texas SB 8 (says Melissa Arjona, who co-founded South Texans for Reproductive Justice), which criminalized 6 week abortion and deputized private citizens to seek out and sue those who participate. Where once women were able to make choices \u2014 albeit with limits, and often with plenty of attacks from others \u2014 they have become bounties to conservatives. In a further chilling detail, Lizelle was turned over to authorities by the hospital.\nThe story of Lizelle\u2019s arrest and subsequent release might be commanding headlines this week, but she isn\u2019t the first woman to face such charges. And she won\u2019t be the last. In 2012, an Idaho woman was arrested for a self-induced abortion; in 2015, a Georgia woman was charged with murder after she gave birth on her way to the hospital after taking abortifacients. Some have even been arrested and convicted for miscarriages suspected by physicians to be abortions (despite what the woman herself says). Does it sound dystopian? It should; it\u2019s the stuff of Margaret Atwood\u2019s Handmaid\u2019s Tale \u2014 and yet it has become very real indeed. We even have a window into that future: El Salvador.\nManuela\u2019s story came to light in 2008; a mother of two, pregnant, and very ill, she was carried to the hospital by her relatives. She had begun to hemorrhage, lost the fetus, and also consciousness, by the time they arrived \u2014 but instead of helping Manuela, the doctor turned her over to authorities, who decided it was an abortion. They put her in prison to serve a 30 years sentence; she died in 2010. More than 140 women have been charged under El Salvador\u2019s ban on abortion since 1998. Some (like Manuela) claim they miscarried rather than having an abortion, but whether the loss of a fetus was intended or not, the law is very clear: a woman\u2019s life is of no value. El Salvador has also let innumerable women die during pregnancies because they also outlawed any termination of a fetus, even if both woman is in danger of death.\nEl Salvador is a small country in Central American struggling with gang violence and high homicide rates as well as the fallout from civil war. Its struggles may seem worlds away from those in the U.S., but we have our own stories like it.\nKeysheonna Reed lived in Arkansas, in a small house with nine other people. She woke one night with terrible pains, and gave birth to two stillborn babies. Unsure what to do, she placed them in a suitcase as a coffin, and left it on the side of a county road. In the ensuing investigation, Kesheonna would be charged with \u201cabuse of a corpse\u201d \u2014 a law frequently used by courts to punish pregnancy loss. It was used against a New York woman who went to the hospital following spontaneous miscarriage; she was charged for putting the body in a garbage bag. But other life choices may be used as evidence against a woman as well: Brittney Poolaw presently faces a four-year sentence after her miscarriage because she used marijuana and methamphetamines while pregnant. In New York in 2008, a woman was charged with manslaughter for her own miscarriage after a car accident because she was not wearing a seatbelt.\nI do not list these latter cases to privilege miscarriage over abortion \u2014 far from it. Rather, I do so to make a terrifying point. The laws against abortion are, in fact, laws against women. Anti-abortion advocates say that a fetus is more valuable than a woman, and simultaneously suggest that a woman\u2019s value resides only in her ability to carry a fetus to term. There is no point in splitting hairs about which terminations are which, because in the eyes of anti-abortion law, the woman is considered as guilty either way. A woman has no right to her body, no right to how it is used or perceived. She may be impregnated against her will, forced to carry against her will, incarcerated against her will. We must fight the stripping away of our rights, beginning with the right to an abortion.\nLizelle Herrera\u2019s case has been called a harbinger of things to come if Roe vs Wade is overturned. That will probably happen as early as June 2022. As reported by Vox, twenty-two states already have laws on the books that ban abortion. The fact that charges have been dismissed against Lizelle should not encourage us to let down our guard. We are living through a new conservative war against the rights of women (and also LGBTQ); it will not end here. It won\u2019t end with the probable upset of Roe vs. Wade. In fact, it won\u2019t end. As with so many attacks on our rights, we must stand up now, and do it together, or watch decades of progress slip away.", "comment_count": 2, "like_count": 517, "created_time": 1649698789459, "comment": [{"user_id": "4b85ed7d479f", "comment_time": 1649698789459, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "78d77b18289a", "comment_time": 1649899199352, "comment": "Absolutely terrifying!

Whether it\u2019s disability, or gender, or culture, or race, when it comes to rights it\u2019s almost always a fight for equal treatment. But there\u2019s something else that doesn\u2019t get talked about as much, and that\u2019s how to explain ourselves to others. It\u2019s hard. It\u2019s also best illustrated as a conversation, but let\u2019s start by breaking down the word.\n\u201cBinary\u201d means \u201cthere are two.\u201d That\u2019s it . Binary code is made of 1s and 0s, a binary power cycle is power generation using only two circuits. There are two things, and only two.\nNow, as human beings, we have a tricky relationship with binaries. We like using phrases like \u201cgood and evil,\u201d or \u201cblack and white,\u201d or \u201copen and shut.\u201d The trouble is, none of our lives work that way. Even hard or mean people are no all \u201cbad\u201d. And I\u2019ve known amazing, wonderful, kind people \u2014 and I can\u2019t say they were all \u201cgood.\u201d Likewise, never has any situation been black and white without shades of gray, nor a court case that was \u201conly\u201d open and shut. I can say this with a degree of certainty because humans are complicated. Situations are muddy. In the US, having amendments and courts to interpret the laws functionally demonstrates this wiggle-room. Everyone lives in the gray betweens.\nSo, non-binary, at its most basic, means \u201cnot only two.\u201d Aren\u2019t you glad? Having to live in a black and white world would not just be dangerous (because even a hair\u2019s breadth could send you from one to the other, wholesale), it would be dull. Who isn\u2019t annoyed by an acquaintance saying \u201cI know exactly what you\u2019re like \u2014 you\u2019re always/never [x].\u201d We don\u2019t live in an always/never world. We live in a maybe/sometimes world. Here is how I try to explain that.\nA Casual Conversation Among Friends\nME: I am non-binary.\nInterlocutor: So you go by they/them?\nM: I use she/her.\nI: Oh, but I thought you didn\u2019t have a gender?\nThere are a-gender people; that is, people who identify as neither gender, as NO gender. There are others who identify as a third gender, because they don\u2019t really see themselves in either camp. There are also gender-fluid people, who feel differently about their gender at different times. The term non-binary acts like an umbrella for \u201cpeople whose gender identity doesn\u2019t sit comfortably with \u2018man\u2019 or \u2018woman\u2019.\nI was assigned female at birth, and have been largely socialized as female. Sort of. For all the reasons, I never squared very well with that box, and often was described as being \u201cmasculine.\u201d I didn\u2019t really get why there were divisions; I was just me, doing me things. I do think of myself as a woman. But not only a woman. I have man bits. And then there are times when I don\u2019t think of myself as either woman or man, just a sort of brain on legs. I used to call it Tom-boy or Woman+PLUS. These days I jokingly say I am Autism Gendered. I present as masculine and/or feminine, but I am always just me inside. To resume the conversation:\nI: So does that mean you\u2019re really a woman, but sort of dressing up as a man?\nThis kind of question is often well-meant. The problem isn\u2019t with what I am, but the phrase \u201creally a.\u201d I have sometimes tried to use analogies. A doctor is wearing scrubs and coat with a stethoscope; he takes it off, but you wouldn\u2019t ask \u201care you really a doctor or just dressed as one.\u201d Of course, the analogy breaks down pretty quickly. How do I help the person I\u2019m speaking to see that the binary concept is the problem? It looms up and it blocks their view.\nI: Are you trans if you are non-binary?\nM: Some trans people identify as non-binary, though not a majority. Similarly, non-binary people don\u2019t always identify as trans, though it can be an umbrella term, too. I would say, personally, that I am not transitioning, which is partly where the word comes from. I am not at one place and moving toward another; I am hanging out between in the both/and.\nI: \u2026\nI: What?\nI am so sympathetic to this response. To those who are really trying, and who are coming from a highly binary-coded world, it must sound like advanced calculus, or like I\u2019m transliterating Klingon. If non-binary is an umbrella term, how is trans an umbrella term, too? How can you be in both, while others are in one or the other, or neither? And that\u2019s before we get to gender identity vs. gender expression (how you identify and how you look don\u2019t always align \u2014 nor do they have to).\nI: Wouldn\u2019t it just be easier to pick a gender and stick with it?\n\u201cEasier\u201d as in not having to fight it out all the time? Yes, of course, that\u2019s why so many trans and non-binary people stayed in the closet for so long. But it\u2019s not easier to live that way. To be expected to live as something you are not hurts. Everyone deserves to be seen as an authentic self, not as some calculated persona invented by others. Don\u2019t we applaud when women rise up and do great things in the sciences even after being told it\u2019s not their place? We no longer expect them to put aside education or politics as we did a hundred+ years ago; why would we want to harness anyone else to ill-fitted identities?\nI: So you are a woman, and she/her, but also not a woman the way we normally mean it. Because you have man bits, and maybe some middle bits that aren\u2019t either\u2026 What does that make you, then?\nM: Do you mean where do I belong? What category can you put me in?\nI: Uh-oh.\nIt\u2019s so hard to get away from binary thinking in terms of gender that we usually end up going in circles. I understand\u2014 I did this dance myself. Was I trans? Was I trying to be a man? What did I even want to be? But all of that is, in the end, still looking for \u201cthe\u201d answer, as if there were only one to choose from. Each of us are completely unique sets of data and DNA, of code and matter, blood and bones, bits and pieces of ancient stardust (and some microplastics apparently). You don\u2019t just have fingerprints. You are a fingerprint \u2014 a completely unique phenomenon in the universe, never before and never to be again. I AM this person, containing multitudes, contradictions, gray areas, aspects of both genders and possibly some dragons and vampires. How could I ever put that in a box as small as a single gender?\nI: It feels like you are saying we\u2019re all like that, as though each of us is bigger than the boxes.\nM: That is exactly what I\u2019m saying.\nI: But I thought we were talking about gender?\nWe are talking, truly, about what we mean by binary vs. non-binary. What\u2019s fascinating to me is how willing we are to see our vastness, our expansiveness, when we aren\u2019t talking about gender. I sometimes see affinities to Plato\u2019s allegory of the cave; the one who gets out into the sunshine has infinite trouble describing it to those who still think the cave ceiling is the sky. If we could just take a step back for a moment \u2014 back from the fearmongering that has entered the discourse largely over political vote-chasing \u2014 we could see that to be human is to be bigger than our boxes. And so of course, gender must spill over, too.\nThis is just my perspective. There are so many ways of being and seeing gender, and they can all be valid. If you are looking for ways of supporting non-binary people in your life, TransEquality has some good steps here. They also have a resource on what it means to be trans. Both trans and non-binary people face a lot of scrutiny and prejudice, as do others in the LGBTQIA family. We need and love our allies.

Photo: Joshua Sortino / Unsplash\nScience cannot tell us when the moment of death occurs. Despite all of our technology and all of our research, we still have only a legal definition of death \u2014 not a medical or scientific one. Why? Those ephemeral moments between being a living thing and a collection of inanimate materials cannot be measured, and it\u2019s hard to agree on the unusual data that remains. Does the brain die all at once? How much of it must die before it\u2019s really dead? And what if \u2014 in some bizarre way \u2014 thoughts persist after the brain itself has shut down?\nIn February of 2022, in the midst of Russian airstrikes against Ukraine and resurgent cases of Covid variants across Europe, an unusual case study gave us the clearest window yet on the dying human brain.\nAn 87-year-old patient started to have seizures after surgery, so doctors used electroencephalography (EEG) to keep track of his condition. He died shortly after, and is the first human being to have their death recorded in real time. We have, in essence, a recording of his dying moments.\n\u201cWe measured 900 seconds of brain activity around the time of death and set a specific focus to investigate what happened in the 30 seconds before and after the heart stopped beating,\u201d said Ajmal Zemmar, a neurosurgeon at the University of Louisville. In a paper for Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience, he explained that, \u201cJust before and after the heart stopped working, we saw changes in a specific band of neural oscillations, so-called gamma oscillations, but also in others such as delta, theta, alpha, and beta oscillations.\u201d In essence, the brain had a surge of advanced cognitive activity: It sped up rather than slowing down, like the flash of a candle before going out.\nWhat can these oscillations tell us about the brain as it dies? We know from previous brain research that the neural oscillations measured here are involved in things like dreaming, meditation, memory retrieval, and even flashbacks, where the memories are so intense the patient \u201cdissociates\u201d and feels as if they are back at the time of the event. Zemmar described the patient\u2019s dying brain activity as similar to just such life-recall, suggesting that this might explain near-death experience (NDE), where patients report feeling outside their bodies, seeing past events, or having a sense of moving toward a light.\nAnd yet, for many, the commonality of near-death experiences have served as proof of something more. NDE are triggered during life-threatening episodes when the body is injured. Thousands of survivors talk about leaving their damaged bodies, going to \u201ca realm beyond everyday existence\u201d and being out of space and time. Many see these as mystical experiences, with religious overtones \u2014 some even suggest it is proof of life after death. Does this new evidence of the brain\u2019s activity in a dying patient at last answer the questions about where life begins and ends, and even explain away the out-of-body sensations, the sense of peace, the march toward the light?\nChristof Koch, writing for Scientific American, reminds us that \u201cNDEs have been with us at all times in all cultures and in all people, young and old, devout and skeptical,\u201d but that \u201call our thoughts, memories, percepts and experiences are an ineluctable consequence of the natural causal powers of our brain rather than of any supernatural ones.\u201d He provides numerous examples, from 18th-century naval officers to surgery survivors in the 20th and 21st centuries \u2014 all report a similar phenomenon, and suggest the experience is somehow \u201crealer than real.\u201d He accounts for this by describing the way a brain, starved of oxygen and near death, shuts itself down region by region \u2014 and suggests that the remaining portions do what they can with power remaining by telling stories.\nThe new information from this singular case study doesn\u2019t wholly contradict this, but instead reveals that there seems to be a surge of activity after we might expect the brain to have already powered out. As reported, \u201cspectral analysis revealed a surge in absolute gamma power after suppression of neuronal activity in both hemispheres\u201d before ultimately declining and ceasing altogether. This activity does not save the brain from death. So why have we have this interplay between neuronal frequencies as we lay dying? What evolutionary principle does it serve?\nAccording to Zemmar, the brain remained somehow both active and coordinated even after death and may \u201c be programmed to orchestrate the whole ordeal.\u201d And this raises some unusual questions not only about when exactly life ends (already very muddy waters) but also about why our mind-life ends in the way that it does.\nIt might help grieving families to know that a loved one was playing the nicest memories at the end, and that they may have experienced a sense of peace in much the same way those suffering an NDE do. It\u2019s not possible to extrapolate fully from a single case, but let\u2019s imagine for a moment that all brains surge at death, replaying and reimagining the most important moments of life (note: This assumption appears to be backed up, at least in part, by studies in rats). Why? If anything, the case is not the solving of a mystery \u2014 it does not reduce the brain or its untraceable wonders so much as enlarge them by asking new questions.\nNature is nothing if not efficient. Though evolutionary processes may make an organism more complex or more simple, the changes are driven by the necessities of preserving a species. A study published in 2021 by Brain Communication indicated that NDE had evolved from thanatosis \u2014 the paralytic state we know as \u201cplaying dead\u201d to avoid predation.\nPossums are perhaps the most famous for this trick, followed by fainting goats and species of snake. The authors proposed that the acquisition of language enabled humans to transform these events into life-recall. The (highly debatable) theory is interesting, but doesn\u2019t make sense of the death-brain-surge. If the brain, as our most highly operating bodily system, chooses to use its last moments to create \u201crealer than real\u201d memories of important events, what benefit does that serve?\nWe know that a dying tree will send its nutrients out through a \u201cwood wide web\u201d of mycorrhizal fungi, where individual plants join together symbiotically. Science writer Robert MacFarlane explains this intimacy as mutualism: \u201cfungal network also allows plants to distribute resources \u2014 sugar, nitrogen, and phosphorus \u2014 between one another.\u201d In addition, an injured plant, or one under attack, sends airborne chemical messages to all other surrounding plants that danger is on the way. There are times, therefore, when a surge of energy flows out of the dying organism to benefit those around it. We mimic this same approach in our man-made technologies, such as safety systems that draw power from other areas when under attack, or the frantic uploading of data to the cloud from a failing hard drive. Is it possible that our brains, with their surge of important information and formative memories, are trying to do the same?\nIt makes for excellent science fiction ruminations. Humans sending out their most important thoughts or memories to others have been explored in fiction as diverse as Arthur Conan Doyle\u2019s The Leather Funnel, the 1983 film Brainstorm, and even the new sci-fi series The OA. There\u2019s no evidence that the surge of activity in the brain ever escapes out of it. But neither do we have an explanation for its presence.\nNeurosurgeon-scientist Robert White once compared the brain to a vessel carrying the soul. When challenged that we have no proof of souls, White, a devout Catholic, responded that we have no proof otherwise. And so, even on the heels of our latest discoveries, we return to the mystery that shrouds the last moments between life and death. We may be as uncertain about what that tells us as ever we were \u2014 but with even greater appreciation for the mysterious inner-space of our own cerebral processes.", "comment_count": 14, "like_count": 1073, "created_time": 1645652700295, "comment": [{"user_id": "4b85ed7d479f", "comment_time": 1645652700295, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "545a7bcd09c9", "comment_time": 1648260156418, "comment": "This is a fascinating subject.

Donald Trump", "content": "Politics\nThe United States Vs. Donald Trump\nA critical moment in the fight for justice, and to save our democracy.\nPhoto by Gage Skidmore at Flickr\nIt has been 459 days since Donald Trump executed a lethal coup to keep himself in power, after he was decisively voted out of office by the American people. Trump and his allies in and outside of government concocted a false slate of electors, and pressured state and federal officials to overturn the 2020 election results based on false allegations of fraud, culminating in a violent assault on the U.S. Capitol to prevent the peaceful transfer of power to Joe Biden.\nSince then, every attempt to secure American democracy against Trump\u2019s autocratic ambitions has stalled out or fallen apart, even as he prepares to run for a third catastrophic bid in 2024. The clock is ticking down. Tick, tock.\nThe DOJ has finally widened its January 6 probe, investigating the former president and his political allies who instigated the violence, after months spent targeting only the rioters themselves. Attorney General Merrick Garland has been under increasing pressure to prosecute Trump and his cronies, but he\u2019s moved at a snail\u2019s pace, even as the cancer in our democracy metastasizes.\nPresident Biden has reportedly been displeased with his AG\u2019s painfully slow, lackluster approach to the most important investigation in American history. Like the rest of us, Biden saw Trump commit crimes in public, and he must be wondering, \u201cWhat is taking so long?\u201d\nThere\u2019s a balance between conducting a deliberative and careful inquiry, and the urgency of protecting the country against a continuing threat. Thus far, Garland\u2019s failing to strike it, opting for endless delays while offering little evidence of real progress.\nStill, the investigation into Trump appears to be reaching a critical mass, whether the AG likes it or not.\nThe House January 6 Committee has its own ongoing investigation into Trump, though it has no power to prosecute anyone for the underlying crimes. They announced today that they have evidence that Trump committed crimes as he tried to overturn the election. They\u2019re currently weighing whether or not to make a criminal referral to the DOJ, a largely symbolic act which would only add to the growing pressure on Garland to secure a criminal indictment against the former president.\nApparently, there\u2019s serious disagreement within the 1/6 Committee over whether or not to take this step, amid fears that a congressional referral would only saddle any future prosecution with even more political baggage than it already would have. However, a recent test of the actual evidence the 1/6 Committee has gathered was promising. Federal District Court Judge David Carter ruled that Donald Trump and John Eastman both likely committed crimes in their efforts to overturn the election, saying: \u201cThe illegality of the plan was obvious.\u201d\nIndeed, obstructing Congress is a felony, as is conspiracy to defraud. Donald Trump did these things in plain sight, and Judge Carter\u2019s ruling recognized the blatant criminality involved in trying to overturn a fair election based on lies and, ultimately, violence.\nAnalysts believe this federal judge\u2019s ruling will prove to be an important factor pushing Merrick Garland forward with his investigation. Still, a referral by the 1/6 Committee would add even greater pressure, amid complex political calculus by all involved.\nAs it stands, we\u2019re approaching a moment of truth for a criminal prosecution of the former president. The incessant delays by the DOJ in moving forward will make any trial even more difficult, if and when it happens, as witnesses and targets alike have had ample time to get their stories straight.\nStill, there was so much lawlessness during Donald Trump\u2019s nightmarish presidency, that it can be hard to keep track of all the various overlapping inquiries, and whether or not they have a serious chance at achieving any kind of justice in a courtroom.\nYet another federal investigation into Trump began this week, according to the Washington Post, examining the boxes of classified documents found strewn at his estate at Mar-a-Lago. The FBI opened this particular probe even as the Manhattan DA\u2019s inquiry into Trump\u2019s financial dealings fell apart, with senior prosecutors lacerating each other in the media over its failure. Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg insists that the investigation is ongoing, despite the appearance of its collapse.\nThe FBI investigation into Trump\u2019s gross mishandling of classified material is only the latest in a long line of star-crossed federal and state inquiries into the former president\u2019s litany of misconduct, and probably not the last. Despite the scores of criminal, civil, and congressional investigations, Trump remains politically strong, with Republicans eagerly seeking his endorsement prior to the midterm elections.\nA criminal indictment may be the only thing standing between the United States and Donald Trump, at this point, as he cements his power in the GOP, and prepares for another disastrous run for the presidency.\nThis is how democracies die, when justice fails to hold the powerful to account for wrongdoing. Indeed, that is the truncated version of the story of Trump and Trumpism in America.\nJustice delayed is justice denied.\nTrump remains the undisputed leader of a radicalized and antidemocratic Republican Party, hellbent on absolute power, and singularly devoted to the destruction of majoritarian politics in the United States. His crimes are manifold, and in plain sight for all to see. He cannot be given a pass.\nBesides being the practical leader of a movement devoted to destroying American democracy, Trump is a powerful symbol of that movement\u2019s success evading justice. It\u2019s past time for him to be prosecuted, and for justice to be restored in America. It\u2019s as politically challenging as it is necessary.\nThe DOJ can\u2019t allow political considerations to smother justice. At a certain point, the AG is going to have to put Donald Trump in the dock, as a defendant, and try him on the mountains of evidence documenting his prolific wrongdoing. No conviction is ever guaranteed, but a trial would suggest that American democracy is still working, even after Trump\u2019s efforts to destroy it.\nSubscribe here for free to see my latest work\nJoin Medium with my referral link - Alexander Ziperovich\nAs a Medium member, a portion of your membership fee goes to writers you read, and you get full access to every story\u2026alexziperovich.com\nRussia\u2019s Nazi Terror Tactics in Ukraine\nFor Vladimir Putin, savagery is the entire point.medium.com\nA Moment of Mortal Peril in Ukraine\nThe chances for catastrophic escalation and miscalculation are rising, as Vladimir Putin faces military defeat in\u2026medium.com", "comment_count": 17, "like_count": 736, "created_time": 1649378816771, "comment": [{"user_id": "4229f274cb19", "comment_time": 1649378816771, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "787bb9cd4ce3", "comment_time": 1649811214744, "comment": "I'm still in disbelief that Trumpy, an obvious classic grifter and snake oil salesman was so easily able to manipulate so many low information, poorly educated sycophants."}, {"user_id": "8b257772d976", "comment_time": 1649698838599, "comment": "I\u2019m hopeful that Merrick Garland is using caution in order to dot every I and cross every T.

Instead, Ukraine has shown itself to be a capable and inspired adversary, fighting doggedly for its very life and freedom, while the feared Russian army struggles to achieve even its most modest goals, all while unleashing an inferno of agony and destruction on Ukraine\u2019s civilians.\nIndeed, the lumbering Russian military has been racked with immense casualties, and paralyzed by logistical snafus and poor morale, as the odor of corruption and incompetence wafts through their ranks, all set against the backdrop of Russia\u2019s wanton brutality against innocents. These setbacks have severely undermined Putin\u2019s carefully constructed image of a sophisticated post-Soviet Russian military on the world stage, a global player acting as a necessary counterbalance to an overreaching American superpower.\nRussia\u2019s savagery has been matched only by their ineptness; it\u2019s a bad combination. Russia\u2019s propagandists have their work cut out for them.\nThey\u2019ve been forced to retreat on multiple fronts, following their doomed invasion of northern Ukraine, to focus on \u201cliberating the Donbas,\u201d and they\u2019re leaving a trail of war crimes and atrocities behind them. Now, it\u2019s unclear if they\u2019re capable of fulfilling even this limited goal of securing this far smaller eastern region, as increasingly sophisticated American-made weapons pour into Ukraine\u2019s arsenals.\nUkraine\u2019s stunning defiance, alongside Russia\u2019s inferior military performance, have created a dynamic and highly combustible conflict. It\u2019s conceivable that Ukraine actually wins the conventional war outright, an unthinkable prospect 50 days ago.\nWhat savagery might Putin resort to then? The answers are terrifying.\nBlowback\nAs if to put an exclamation point on Russia\u2019s failures, Ukrainian forces sunk Russia\u2019s Slava-class flagship missile cruiser, the Moskva, with several Neptune anti-ship missiles fired from the coast of Odessa. The Russians unconvincingly claimed it was a fire that scuttled the ship, yet another crude piece of Kremlin propaganda.\nIt\u2019s a particularly ominous sign for Moscow; the 500-crew ship was the pride of the Black Sea Fleet, and the flagship, housing their command-and-control. It was a stinging slap in the face from Ukraine, which has also recently been launching effective cross-border raids inside Russia itself.\nThe Moskva\u2019s sinking is joined by news that both Finland and Sweden are swiftly moving toward joining NATO, amid a European reimagining of national security provoked by Russia\u2019s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.\nThis is rather astonishing news. Finland maintained its neutrality throughout the entire Cold War, until now. It\u2019s a reminder of the seismic geopolitical consequences of a war the Kremlin still refers to (under penalty of 15 years in prison) with the benign euphemism, \u201cspecial military operation.\u201d Clearly, this \u201cspecial military operation\u201d is having far-reaching and entirely unexpected effects, and will continue to evolve rapidly, as Russia launches its next phase in Ukraine\u2019s Donbas region.\nThis was underscored by the increasingly sophisticated weapons systems that are pouring into Ukraine from along its western border; Soviet era S-300 air defense systems are coming in from Slovakia, as another 800 million dollars of American weapons transit through Poland toward the frontlines.\nOnly in Putin\u2019s very worst nightmares, might he have imagined the unlikely prospect of Finnish and Swedish NATO membership, or Soviet-made air defense systems pouring into Ukraine. Now both are happening simultaneously, and the stakes keep rising, for Russia and everyone else.\nThe United States Vs. Donald Trump\nA critical moment in the fight for justice, and to save our democracy.medium.com\nPutin\u2019s nightmare, and the world\u2019s\nPutin\u2019s larger geo-strategic goals have been shattered: support for NATO has surged rather than weakened, the European alliance has been reinvigorated by the threat of Russian aggression, and Ukrainian nationhood is being felt more strongly than at any other time in its history, accompanied by a savage new loathing of Russia that is unlikely to fade anytime soon.\nPrior to the war NATO was on the verge of political bankruptcy, the EU was literally coming apart at the seams, and much of Ukraine felt intimately connected to Russia, as brotherly Slavic nations with much shared culture and history. That is now the past, precisely because of Vladimir Putin.\nThese are massive strategic reversals; it\u2019s the kind of blowback that could threaten Putin\u2019s grip on power, as those around him begin to sense an opening in his weakness, and question his leadership.\nIndeed, Vladimir Putin\u2019s back is up against the proverbial wall. His forces can afford no more failure before the consequences could be expected to manifest in the streets of Moscow, or worse, inside the gilded halls of the Kremlin. Historically, the Russian people have been entirely unforgiving toward leaders who presided over military failures as vast as this. Still, this reality only underscores the immense danger of the moment.\nVladimir Putin simply can\u2019t afford to lose. The next phase of this war in Ukraine\u2019s east will be crucial, and extraordinarily perilous. If Russia continues to lose its war, Putin can be expected to become even more dangerous and unpredictable, until the moment he is deposed, or killed.\nAfter all, he still controls the largest arsenal of nuclear weapons in the world, and he\u2019s repeatedly said that he\u2019s not afraid to use them. CIA director Bill Burns said today in an interview that we shouldn\u2019t \u201ctake lightly\u201d the fact that if Putin were cornered, he might lash out with low-yield tactical nukes.\nI for one, am not taking that horrifying prospect lightly at all.

The brutality on display is staggering, as a fratricidal war of aggression continues, with no end in sight, and every chance it will get even uglier before it\u2019s over.\nNoam Chomsky recently said that we\u2019re approaching \u201cthe most dangerous point in human history.\u201d It\u2019s an accurate and chilling appraisal.\nOnce again, as in 1941, Eastern Europe is in flames. This time it\u2019s a rampaging Russian army slicing through small towns and leveling massive metropoles, leaving a trail of atrocities in their wake. Russia\u2019s savage conduct is reminiscent of the Wermacht, and the Waffen SS, even as Russian (and Chinese) propaganda specialists blanket the airwaves in lies about the \u201cdenazification\u201d of Ukraine, and blame Russia\u2019s numerous war crimes on \u201cNazi provocations.\u201d\nIt\u2019s hardly convincing, though Russian troll farms continue to hawk their absurd lies on a prolific scale. After hundreds of civilians were discovered tortured, raped, or bound and shot in Bucha and elsewhere, Russian propagandists accused Ukraine of staging these horrors.\nFor all the brazen savagery, however, the war has gone poorly for Vladimir Putin, and it\u2019s threatening to be his downfall. War crimes don\u2019t win wars.\nThe Russian army has proved itself to be an inept, lumbering killer, unable to formulate a coherent battlefield plan, coordinate logistics for its troops, or protect its highest ranking generals from assassination.\nInstead, it\u2019s spewing indiscriminate firepower on cities, and murdering civilians, even as its own forces have been decimated by Ukrainian troops. Perhaps 20,000 Russian soldiers have died in the fighting thus far, with countless more injured and out of action, officers and infantrymen alike.\nA quarter of the invading force is dead, along with countless Ukrainians.\nYet Vladimir Putin remains adaptable, and he\u2019s changed course, pulling his forces back, and reorganizing his remaining troops, right before the Russian army appeared ready to collapse. Thus, the war goes on, now in the East.\nThe Butcher of Syria\nWe\u2019re entering a new and highly unpredictable phase of this conflict. Putin himself today poured cold water on any kind of negotiated peace, saying talks hit a \u201cdead end.\u201d His defiance was remarkable, and chilling.\nIndeed, Putin\u2019s installed the \u201cButcher of Syria\u201d as the overall commander of his forces in Ukraine, Alexander Dvornikov, best known for his savage tactics in Syria. He left behind him a trail of mass graves and chemical weapons attacks in that country, and his appointment is evidence of Putin\u2019s growing bloodlust, and his desire for vengeance.\nPutin\u2019s humiliation in the first part of this war, when the Russian military\u2019s incompetence and hubris were revealed to the world, his forces halted at the gates of Kyiv, bodes for even more horror. His war aims have been scaled back, his army focused on subduing a far smaller chunk of Eastern Ukraine, though the brutality may be magnified, as Russia concentrates its massive firepower.\nIndeed, there are troubling but unverified reports that a chemical agent was dropped from a drone on one of the last remaining redoubts in Mariupol, a city that has been under siege for weeks.\nThe use of chemical weapons is an extremely concerning development, marking a significant escalation in the war.\nAs always, the major concern is that Putin feels himself to be cornered, and lashes out with unconventional arms, to include nuclear or chemical weapons, pulling Western powers into the fray. We may have already witnessed this; it\u2019s impossible to predict what might come next, if Putin begins deploying chemical weapons in Ukraine.\nFor now, though, the Russian army has reconstituted its forces in Eastern Ukraine, and the world will once again witness the brutality that is their hallmark. At this point, it\u2019s unclear how this catastrophic war will end. The only certainty is that there will be more destruction in Ukraine, as the world sits on the brink.\nSubscribe here for free to see my latest work\nJoin Medium with my referral link - Alexander Ziperovich\nAs a Medium member, a portion of your membership fee goes to writers you read, and you get full access to every story\u2026alexziperovich.com\nThe United States Vs.

Mass graves are being pried open, revealing their horror to a connected world.\nRussia\u2019s murderous conduct thus far has only reinforced the perversity of Vladimir Putin\u2019s claim that he\u2019s merely weeding out Nazis in what he calls his \u201cspecial military operation\u201d in Ukraine. Rather, he\u2019s committing heinous war crimes, and inflicting utterly unnecessary devastation.\nIt\u2019s an absurdist, Orwellian nightmare, and it\u2019s quickly becoming a quagmire for Russia that will be hard to escape. The world is witnessing a slaughter, and as the war worsens, it\u2019s exerting its own force of gravity on the wider world, threatening to pull it in.\nIt\u2019s impossible to ignore, or even look away. It\u2019s unbearable.\nIt is the dark momentum of war, and it is speeding up.\nWho are the Nazis?\nAs Russian troops \u201cregrouped\u201d or retreated out of the destroyed suburbs surrounding Kyiv, they left behind them a grisly tableau of carnage and inhumanity. It\u2019s a particularly familiar type of organized terror, and one this region has seen before, during the brutal exterminationist occupation by Nazi Germany, of what was then part of the Soviet Union.\nBut unlike Operation Barbarossa, this destruction is being inflicted by Slavs against Slavs, and for no greater reason than a single delusional dictator hellbent on conquest. Ukraine suffers for Russia\u2019s authoritarian disease.\nThe Russian military appears to have taken a page from what historians refer to as the \u201cHolocaust by Bullets,\u201d an important preliminary stage of the genocide committed by the Nazis during the Second World War, before the German state built the mechanized death factories at Auschwitz, Dachau, Chelmno, and elsewhere across Poland and Ukraine.\nIndeed, in the very first days of this war, Russian forces struck a memorial commemorating the 33,771 Jews murdered at Babyn Yar, in what was a grim portent of things to come.\nNow, as Putin goes about his \u201cdenazification\u201d of Ukraine, the Russian armed forces have come to resemble no one so much as the bloodthirsty Einsatzgruppen units that swept through this very same region, leaving a trail of mass murder and infamy behind them. Russia\u2019s also implemented \u201cfiltration camps\u201d in Ukraine, a euphemistic term for concentration camps.\nIt seem Putin cannot escape the contradictions of his barbaric war of choice in Ukraine, despite his best efforts to write his own false narrative using Russia\u2019s endless stream of empty propaganda.\nInstead, the dead cry out, haunting the living.\nBucha\nIn Bucha, the blackening dead lay frozen in the streets for weeks, uncollected and dusted with frost, civilians with their hands bound behind their backs, shirts pulled over their faces, bullet wounds to the head.\nUkrainians were summarily executed in this way, others tortured, some raped. Still others are buried within the rubble that was previously their home, school, maternity hospital, the victims of errant strikes rained down on Ukraine.\nTragically, this is nothing new nor unexpected from the Russian military.\nIt\u2019s the kind of campaign of terror we\u2019ve seen Russian forces undertake in Chechnya, Georgia, and most recently, in Syria, where Russian forces have been accused of slaughtering civilian populations. Now it\u2019s on a bigger stage, and on NATO\u2019s doorstep; the combat is ferocious, bitter, and intimate, if combat can be such a thing.\nRussian soldiers reportedly booby trapped the dead in Bucha, before they pulled out. Still, Russia\u2019s brutality isn\u2019t winning the war. That much is clear by now.\nIt seems these murderous tactics are having the unintended effect of strengthening Ukraine\u2019s resistance, rather than breaking it.\nIndeed, Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky has weaponized what appear to be Russian war crimes, which have been widely reported and catalogued by horrified Western journalists, and war crimes investigators.\nRussia\u2019s brutality is galvanizing public opinion worldwide, and making it even harder to negotiate any kind of peace. Who can negotiate with butchers? It\u2019s a quandary for a world that must avoid nuclear annihilation, and strive for something approaching justice.\nWhat\u2019s next?\nRussia\u2019s now reorienting itself toward securing the Donbas region of Ukraine, after finding itself totally incapable of capturing Kyiv, or the rest of Ukraine. It\u2019s a far smaller goal than subjugating the entire massive country, and yet it\u2019s unclear if Russia can succeed.\nRussia\u2019s lost perhaps 15,000 soldiers in Ukraine thus far, an unsustainable number of casualties for an already struggling military, and now Putin\u2019s importing fresh cannon fodder from Syria, Chechnya, and Georgia, and standing up even more mercenaries to fight on his behalf.\nThere\u2019s every chance for escalation from Vladimir Putin, and little chance of capitulation for Ukraine. Russia\u2019s savage tactics have driven away any potential political allies of Moscow, and reinforced Ukraine\u2019s drive to be independent of the Kremlin.\nIt seems this war is as far from a resolution as it\u2019s ever been. The pictures of mass graves and executed civilians have only increased the pressure on Western leaders to fortify Ukraine with weapons and military aid, anything to keep the Kremlin at bay.\nChairman of the Joint Chiefs Mark Milley testified to congress this week that the \u201cpotential for significant international conflict is increasing, not decreasing.\u201d\nWhile that\u2019s hardly surprising, it\u2019s a grim reminder that this war isn\u2019t done claiming victims; it could continue to deteriorate far beyond its current state of protracted warfare, expanding into a global cataclysm.\nRussia\u2019s indiscriminate airstrikes and its execution-style murders of civilians make it even more difficult to imagine any kind of diplomatic path out of the morass Putin\u2019s pushed the world into.\nStill, we must keep trying to escape this abyss. It\u2019s a painfully thin needle to thread, as it feels increasingly necessary to assist Ukraine in its struggle against authoritarian aggression, as we witness Russia\u2019s campaign of mass murder unfold against innocents.\nSubscribe here for free to see my latest work\nJoin Medium with my referral link \u2014 Alexander Ziperovich\nAs a Medium member, a portion of your membership fee goes to writers you read, and you get full access to every story\u2026alexziperovich.com\nA Moment of Mortal Peril in Ukraine\nThe chances for catastrophic escalation and miscalculation are rising, as Vladimir Putin faces military defeat in\u2026medium.com", "comment_count": 6, "like_count": 354, "created_time": 1649106787293, "comment": [{"user_id": "4229f274cb19", "comment_time": 1649106787293, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "787bb9cd4ce3", "comment_time": 1649385865139, "comment": "As usual, your piece is superbly written, insightful and tragically once again reminds us of the worst period of human brutality and unimaginable suffering the world has ever seen."}, {"user_id": "8b257772d976", "comment_time": 1649347246112, "comment": "That\u2019s it in a nutshell.

But that\u2019s what compromise is.\u201d He went on to say that, \u201cI know how deeply people feel about the things they fight for. But this framework includes historic investments in our nation and in our people.\u201d\nThe details are still to be worked out \u2014 including all of the legislative text \u2014 so we shall see just how historic it really is. But it reminded me of when my ex-boyfriend and I used to \u201ccompromise\u201d on vacations. One year, he wanted to go to Europe. I wanted to go to Costa Rica. So we went to his parents\u2019 house in Boca Raton. No one got what they wanted. Compromise got us an unhappy week of shuffleboard.\nI see and support the President\u2019s desire for comity and a willingness to come together to make policy that works for the vast majority of our people, especially after the shitshow of the last four years. He ran on \u201cunity\u201d and winning \u201cthe soul of the nation.\u201d As of this morning, his signature legislation thus far creates neither unity nor nourishes the soul. It seems to plug the holes in our large boat, but it leaves out so much that would have transformed day-to-day American life.\nAll of which begs the question: with whom are we actually compromising? In a two-party system, the actual long-term compromise comes when each party takes power, enacts their policies, and then tries to stay in power to see them fully executed. Democracy is the compromise. The Republicans get in and do their thing. We vote. The Democrats get in and do their thing. We vote. And so on and so forth. Over the long-term, the push-and-pull moves the society forward \u2014 theoretically.\nBut these are odd times. The Republican Party has become a fascist movement led by a supposed-billionaire with a very large chip on his shoulder. Millions of center-right Republicans have been left politically homeless, as they have watched their party literally attack the seat of democracy itself on January 6. That leaves the left \u2014 from the centrists to the progressives \u2014 to govern among themselves for as long as they can make it last.\nBut instead of enacting true-blue legislation and spending to support its priorities, we are compromising with ourselves. Pelosi loves to wield an iron fist when it comes to keeping the far-left in line, but she seems to have no power to keep the center-left in line. The result: today\u2019s \u201ccompromise\u201d is the aftermath of months of two Senators essentially holding the federal government at gunpoint.\nSinema and Manchin, our two faux-blue Dems, have brandished so much power in these negotiations that it has been made crystal-clear that our representative democracy is not representative at all. Here are the basic numbers: Arizona has 7.3M people. West Virginia has 1.8M people. Together, these two represent 9.1M Americans. And that\u2019s being wildly conversative in my math; they are each one-half of the Senate team from each of their states. Being generous, I\u2019ll say they represent 9.1M of 329.5M Americans, so 2.7%.\n2.7%.\nThat means that 48 Democratic Senators who represent well over half of the American people have been \u201cnegotiating\u201d with two people who represent 2.7% of us. And who are also handily in the pocket of Big Oil and Big Pharma. Now, I am sure there is far more sophisticated math available on the Internet that breaks down what that power structure really is, but here is what it is not: representative democracy.\nToday we got the result of decades of gerrymandering, two centuries of immoral lobbying, and a seemingly ineffective political party that has been backed into a corner and forced to be the \u201creasonable\u201d ones in order for there to even be an adult in the room. The framework announced today for the BBB Plan includes the following. In italics are the comments in my head that I felt compelled to type into this digital box.\nWhat is included:\nUniversal Pre-K for 3- and 4-year-olds. Not sure how educating our young is considered historic or groundbreaking, but ok.\nA cap on child-care expenses for some families at no more than 7% of income. Parents must adhere to work requirements to qualify, so get ready to prove you deserve the help to care for your children.\nExpansion of ACA coverage for 4 million more people and a promise to lower premiums by $600 per person for more than 9 million Americans. We\u2019ll see how that math works out in the real world. It did not work out so well last time.\nMedicare expansion to cover hearing services. Because your ears were just not that important before. It will not include coverage for dental and vision. Who needs healthy teeth and eyes anyway?\nExtended child tax credit of $3,600/child ($3,000 if they\u2019re 6\u201318 years old). This is only through 2022, which is, um\u2026next year.\nClimate change and clean energy investments that the White House says will cut more than a gigaton of greenhouses gases by 2030. Manchin, who answers to Big Oil, opposed a more aggressive plan.\nTax credits for electric vehicles and solar panels. Which is about 30 years overdue, so no one gets any points here. Sorry.\nAffordable housing investments of $150B. Which will amount to a lot less change than it sounds at the rate that most real-estate markets are jumping.\nVague investments in maternal health, community violence initiatives, Native communities, and supply chain resilience. Whatever any of that means.\nReform of the immigration system. Which may not end up in the final bill.\nWhat is not included:\n2 free years of community college. Because how dare we educate our people. Much better to have them take monstrous student loans and still be paying for room-and-board 25 years later, banging out their credit so they can\u2019t buy a house (oh, is that just me?)\nCutting prescription drug prices. The bill will not allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices and get the best deal. So Pharma will continue to reap billions and you will continue to pay $1,000 for EpiPens at Walmart.\nPaid family and medical leave. No, we are not going to pay for our nation\u2019s mothers and fathers to take time off after they have that baby. Get back to work, slacker! There are better policies in the former Yugoslavia. We should be embarrassed.\nA billionaire\u2019s tax. We debated that for all of six minutes, the same week that Elon Musk made $37B in a day.\nThis watered-down bill is half of what was originally proposed. Somehow we cannot afford to spend $3.5T over ten years on the American people, but we do not even blink to spend $7.5T on defense in the same period. We\u2019ll all standby for details, but this Build Back Better seems like a trip to Boca to me.

Twitter has lit up in praise of the stunt. Well done, good sir.\nHollywood and Washington, DC, have always been strange bed fellows. In the popular \u2014 and my \u2014 imagination, Jackie Kennedy appearing on the cover of Vogue was a flirtation between the two, Ronald Reagan\u2019s candidacy and presidency was the start of their dating, and Donald Trump\u2019s circus was the first time everybody got, well\u2026ya know. As the entertainment industry corporatized over the 70s, 80s and into the new millennium, and as politics embraced the power of the internet and social media, Hollywood and DC are now intertwined in pretty ghastly ways.\nI always find it funny when people say actors and entertainment folks should \u201ckeep politics out of Hollywood.\u201d The last president was the former host of a reality-television show that ran for more than a decade, and he served concurrently as the leader of the free world and Executive Producer of that same show before it was then hosted by the former governor of California, who was a bodybuilder before he was The Terminator before he married a Kennedy before he controlled the sixth largest economy in the world. Politics and Hollywood are two sides of a very strange coin.\nFor all the power that that gave Trump (and the Conservatives) as he ran the country like a click-bait reality show, this week John Oliver gave a master class on how to turn the tables. On his weekly show on HBOMax, Last Week Tonight with John Oliver, the comedy-show host explained the multi-billion-dollar business of data brokering, which is one of the integral players in the surveillance capitalist state we now find attempting to thrive in. Your email is not just on a list somewhere in a vague database, your entire search history, buying history, and location data are tracked all day long unless you take (often complex) active steps to stop it. The easiest: (1) don\u2019t accept cookies when you browse (but who doesn\u2019t like cookies?!), (2) use an alternative browser with better security (e.g., Brave, Firefox, or DuckDuckGo), and (3) turn off tracking on your phone. At this point, though, Big Tech, Big Media, Big Business and Big Politics know everything about you.\nLeadership comes in many forms, and sometimes Hollywood provides the much-needed checks-and-balances that we thought we designed into the political system.\nIn the climax of this week\u2019s episode (Season 9, Episode 7), Oliver revealed that he bought the private data of anyone in the Capitol Hill area who clicked on one of three ridiculous phony ads that he ran \u2014 one asking \u201cCan you vote twice?,\u201d one selling help because \u201cMarriage shouldn\u2019t be a prison,\u201d and one tempting the clicker with \u201cTed Cruz erotic fan fiction.\u201d With a click, users made it possible for Oliver to harvest and potentially de-anonymize the personal data of hundreds around DC, three of whom clicked from inside the Capitol building. While hilarious, it was televised blackmail to get Congress to pay attention and get their shit together to safeguard our privacy.\nOf course, John Oliver is not the first to do political stunts like this from his comedy stage. Modern late-night hosts like Kimmel and Colbert not only speak out but they have (haha) declared their run for VP, rushed the RNC podium, and the like. Mostly, Oliver takes his inspiration from his political-comedy mentor, Jon Stewart who, among constant weekly strokes of brilliance, left his stage to lead the \u201cRally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear\u201d days before the midterm elections in 2010. Stewart always claimed to just be a comedian, but he managed to be as articulate \u2014 if not more \u2014 than most of our actual politicians about the challenges of our time. He also went on to blast Congress for failing to protect 9/11 first-responders. In 2019, Congress passed an extension of the 9/11 Victims Compensation Fund in response to Stewart\u2019s Congressional testimony.\nPhoto source: USA Today\nYes, we all want Oscar and Emmy and Grammy and Golden Globe recipients to be less righteous when they use their stage time to preach, but leadership comes in many forms, and sometimes Hollywood provides the much-needed checks-and-balances that we thought we designed into the political system. Now, they come from anyone who has a loud voice in this noisy society \u2014 those often with large entertainment followings. These political comedy geniuses have become not only more accurate sources of political news but the moral center of the modern media-entertainment-political-industrial complex. They speak truth to power and to their millions of audience members. Don\u2019t forget that before Volodymyr Zelensky was fighting off Russians in his military greens as the real president of Ukraine, he was the star of the television series, Servant of the People, in which he portrayed\u2026um, the president of Ukraine. America has no monopoly on the fine line between actor and activist.\nWhat a sad state of affairs that not only must Oliver explain what a cookie is to millions of people but he then has to hijack the personal data of sitting members of our government to get them to pay attention. As digital capitalism gets more intense, especially after the pandemic when we saw its (complicated) benefits and seem to have doubled-down on it, moments like this will become all the more important. How do you get a government body that has an average age of 57.6 (the Senate\u2019s is 62.9) to properly legislate against the ills of a tech-led society that is year-by-year iPhone-model-by-iPhone model spiraling out of control?

No one paid a lick of attention to anything that happened on that Hollywood stage after 10:30pm ET, because we were all still reeling from \u2014 and talking, texting, and tweeting about \u2014 the Slap Heard \u2018Round the World.\nWhat should have happened after Chris Rock joked about Jada Pinkett Smith\u2019s bald head is her husband, the Best Actor nominee, a mega Hollywood favorite, should have stood up and led the Dolby Theater in a rousing \u201cBoo!\u201d that would have embarrassed Rock and made Smith look like the hero we have always known and believed him to be. Of course, that did not happen. Smith snapped. And what followed the crass joke was so incredibly gross that PR teams around Hollywood will have their hands full all week dealing with the fallout. They will spin and spin. But the damage is done.\nI\u2019m not sure what was more disgusting: witnessing an A-list actor \u2014 on the most important night of his career, in the most public forum he has ever been in, who was given the coveted front row so that he could be honored \u2014 get up from his seat, walk onto the stage, and smack a comedian and then repeatedly curse him loudly upon his return or the fact that the producers of the show allowed him to take his seat with no consequences, after which 10 million+ people had to watch him be awarded an Oscar \u2014 the highest artistic honor in cinema \u2014 and then had to listen to him babble and cry (!) about being a \u201cvessel of love,\u201d defending his actions because somehow we should all understand that \u201clove will make you do crazy things,\u201d (Sorry, what?) all while doing a downright manipulative quick re-write of his acceptance speech to narratively tie his behavior to his character\u2019s, likening himself, who just assaulted a colleague, to Richard Williams \u2014 whose middle name, by the way, is \u201cDove\u201d \u2014 a man who was beaten up in front of his daughters (we all saw the movie) and chose not to raise his hands to fight back in order to teach them a lesson in humility and grace. All without being played off by the orchestra*, as thousands of peace-loving artists stood up out of their seats and applauded him. (Not everyone, but those who did know who you are.)\n*You know who was played off? Jenny Beaven, winner of the Oscar for best costume design, because apparently no one wants to listen to a wardrobe person get wordy.\nAfter the disastrous show, according to reports, Smith went to the Vanity Fair after-party and celebrated his win by proudly holding court, dancing center-stage to \u201cGettin Jiggy Wit It.\u201d Meanwhile Twitter descended into not Two but Three Americas: one that thinks physical violence is a justifiable response to a classless joke (good for Will!), one that thinks Hollywood finally got exactly what was coming to it and can no longer \u2014 and never could \u2014 claim the moral high ground (see, I told ya, those liberals are all hypocrites!), and one that is still, twelve hours later, baffled and embarrassed by the act, the speech, the audience response, and the state of our society (WTF just happened?!).\nNow we know why and how the last six years in America were what they were. We can watch a person (some might say a narcissistic showman) commit morally questionable acts, with our own eyes, and then when they re-write the story on-the-spot and show no or little shame, we question our own morality (maybe we\u2019re crazy; gaslit much?), while applauding them because we don\u2019t know what else to do. No one wants to step in and say or do what\u2019s right, because we\u2019re all so afraid of shaming, judging, or getting called out on our own shit, so we let this behavior stand and then twist ourselves into pretzels to justify it. After more than a beat to think about it, the voices that call for an appropriate response are drowned out by a media frenzy that clogs all channels. Ratings go up as more eyeballs, clicks, and dollars are focused on debating the morality of it all (this post included). No one pays any consequences, because we are scared to stand up to the rich and powerful, lest we offend our industrial masters. And then tomorrow, we move on.\nSo gross. So embarrassing to us all.\nMost of what we have canceled in \u201ccancel culture\u201d are words. Now we have an assault, which played out in front of our very own eyes. If words are violence, a belief the left has embraced to justify creations like safe spaces on college campuses (not arguing against them, just laying out the logic), is violence also violence? Um, I should think so. It doesn\u2019t matter if it was a slap or a punch. It doesn\u2019t matter that he was a ball of nerves. It doesn\u2019t matter if there is \u201ccritical context\u201d we all need about alopecia. Buzz off. We gathered together as a nation and community of moviegoers last night to celebrate movies about rising above your circumstances (King Richard), love overcoming racism and the violence of street gangs (West Side Story), toxic masculinity and its effects on women and children (Power of the Dog), war between neighbors (Belfast), even how to communicate when words fail you (CODA). More than half the Best Picture nominees were about how to overcome our failures to connect, most about violence and its deadly effects on humanity. The context could not be more damning; the standard could not be set higher.\nIf words are violence, a belief the left has embraced to justify creations like safe spaces on college campuses (not arguing against them, just laying out the logic), is violence also violence? Um, I should think so.\nNo, Will Smith did not invade Ukraine. Will Smith did not put Trump in office. But the physical act combined with the language that he used to re-frame it \u2014 together they are the very toxic masculinity we are all trying so hard to battle in arena after arena in our world today. I did it because I am a \u201cvessel of love.\u201d Holy bullshit, Batman. That is insane.\nHe should have said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Thank you for this award.\u201d And then left the stage and called for his car.\nFar more talented and important people have been canceled for far less. Hollywood now has to decide just how woke it is and just how much of the moral high ground it wants to continue to claim. No one expected that this is how Will Smith\u2019s story would develop, but here we are. Your move, Hollywood. The dress is black-and-blue.

The Gas Rebate Act Is Peak America", "content": "More Checks! The Gas Rebate Act Is Peak America\nA new level of absurdity\nPhoto by Jakob Rosen on Unsplash\nHouse Democrats this week introduced a bill to send \u201cstimulus\u201d checks to consumers to alleviate the ongoing pain at the pump. Under the proposed legislation, for the rest of the year, individuals making $75,000 or less (or couples making $150k or less) would see a $100 check when gas prices exceed $4 per gallon. With numbers like $5/gallon, $6/gallon, even $7/gallon across the country, the answer from Congress is to simply help you pay for it \u2014 with your own money.\nIs there anything more American than massively subsidizing oil and gas companies with public money, which distorts the market and artificially lowers consumer prices, and then when prices get too high anyway also subsidizing consumers on the other end\u2014again with public money? All to prop up an industry that is killing the planet. And then, to make it all worse, balking at the idea of government intervention to control price because that would be manipulating the free market. This is the level of absurdity we have reached in America in 2022.\nThe Environmental and Energy Study Institute reported that direct subsidies to the fossil fuel industry totaled $20 billion per year, with 80% going toward oil and gas.\nI\u2019m not saying I wouldn\u2019t love a check. I live in New York; I don\u2019t drive. I would still love a check. We all love checks. But when you have to subsidize the middle class for basic household expenses like running a car, the system is broken. And yet, we still seem to think that short-term fixes (which \u2014 let\u2019s be real \u2014 are only intended to secure votes during a mid-term election year) are real solutions to deep, deep problems. The answer from our leaders is to offer a temporary fix instead of confronting the nation with the truth: our way of life needs a major overhaul.\nLife in America in 2022 is a nasty blow to your checkbook daily. Not only is gas super expensive, but so are groceries and housing. And most consumer goods. And real estate. And flights, baseball games, and movies. And a laundry list of monthly micro media subscriptions. (Thanks for the increase, Netflix. If you\u2019re going to jack up prices, please make something better than The Power of the Dog.) During the pandemic, our societal failures were exposed in the light of day, and yet two years after the national emergency began, we\u2019re blaming a whole new set of scapegoats: the supply chain, war in Ukraine, and a president who\u2019s been cleaning up the largest political, medical, economic, and international-relations mess in modern history \u2014 all with 40% inflation hovering over his head.\nLet\u2019s look ourselves in the mirror for real. None of this would feel as painful if wages kept pace with inflation, if healthcare was free, if unions were healthy and strong, if corporations lowered their profit expectations to something short of astronomical, if Big Tech didn\u2019t destroy industry after industry on its seemingly unstoppable march to the Metaverse, and if we found a way to accept that reasonable regulations on the free market give it structure and focus. They don\u2019t hamper economic growth; they curb corruption, malfeasance, and exploitation. All of our problems are connected. High gas prices are just what the everyman is bitching about this week.\nPresident Biden, in his defense, is taking steps to change our course. In late January, he signed an executive order directing federal agencies to stop providing subsidies to the fossil-fuel industry. His goals? A carbon pollution-free power sector by 2035 and a net-zero economy by 2050. The push for electric vehicles \u2014 the one you saw on full display in ad-after-ad during the Super Bowl \u2014 is his administration\u2019s effort to finally get the nation to drive green. (We just can\u2019t call it \u201cgreen,\u201d because the \u201cBrotherhood of Muscle\u201d might find that too weak and progressive for their liking.)\nIn the meantime, we will have to settle for short-term fixes and band-aid solutions, like gas rebate checks for $100 which, in all likelihood, will arrive three months after they\u2019re needed, just like the at-home Covid tests. \ud83e\udd26\nRelated Reading\nFossil Fuels Received $5.9 Trillion In Subsidies in 2020, Report Finds\nCoal, oil, and natural gas received $5.9 trillion in subsidies in 2020 - or roughly $11 million every minute \u2026e360.yale.edu\nFACT SHEET: President Biden Takes Executive Actions to Tackle the Climate Crisis at Home and\u2026\nToday, President Biden will take executive action to tackle the climate crisis at home and abroad while creating\u2026www.whitehouse.gov\nReforming global fossil fuel subsidies: How the United States can restart international cooperation\nGlobally, governments spend more than $500 billion on subsidies for fossil fuels that contribute to inefficiency\u2026www.brookings.edu", "comment_count": 9, "like_count": 520, "created_time": 1648227154810, "comment": [{"user_id": "70197a4e8521", "comment_time": 1648227154810, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "ac19eeb639d5", "comment_time": 1648249941183, "comment": "Ever since Reagan politicians have figured out that they don't actually have to do a good job for the long run.

Licensed through Wikimedia Commons\nMajor League Baseball has a Harley-Davidson problem: its primary customers are old and getting older. In both cases, this has been evident for at least a generation and yet neither has landed on a solution. At least Harley, whose beefy motorcycles are known as \u201chogs,\u201d is trying.\nAs a new baseball season begins, doomsayers again are forecasting the sport\u2019s demise. The game is too slow. It lasts too long. There are too many strikeouts. Young people would sooner pawn their PlayStation than tune in. It\u2019s all true. I\u2019m not here to pile on. But I can\u2019t resist the analogy with Harley, which also has been on something like a death watch.\n\u201cThe triple is the most exciting play in baseball\u201d\n\u2014 Hank Aaron\nThe two institutions have a lot in common. Baseball has been around longer, but not much. Harley built its first motorcycle in 1903; MLB was founded in 1876. So, both theoretically know something about survival. Both are iconic brands, as much Americana as Norman Rockwell, Disneyland, and bluegrass.\nBoth also have fallen on rough times. Shipments of new Harleys to dealers are down 60% since 2008. Baseball just had its worst year for attendance since 1984. To be fair, the pandemic had a lot to do with the slide in attendance. But pre-pandemic MLB attendance in 2019 was the lowest since 1997.\nThe average viewer of an MLB telecast is 57 years old, up from 52 two decades ago and the oldest of any major sport. The average age of a Harley rider is\u2026we don\u2019t know exactly. Harley once provided the information but stopped in 2009 as the long-rising average age approached 50. Most analysts agree the average age of a rider is now 50-plus.\nThere is no long-term prosperity for a motorcycle maker whose prime customers are aging out, which data suggest begins at about age 55. Harley may have stopped detailing the discouraging trend in rider age, but the demographics are hardly a secret. With Armageddon on its horizon, Harley\u2019s stock has been dead money for two decades, and a massive loser since 2013.\nBaseball is a bit different. But its long-term prosperity is nonetheless in question. Older fans will watch games until they die. Arguably, they will watch even more games as they become less active. But the trend is still a nightmare because aging fans don\u2019t go to the ballpark as often, and they don\u2019t spend money on jerseys or, well, much of anything.\nWho is going to advertise on those MLB telecasts? Nightly network news has already sponged up Big Pharma\u2019s marketing budget; daytime TV has sewed up the spend on retirement villages and reverse mortgages.\nI\u2019m a baseball fan. I love that there is a game every day, unique in major sports. I love the storylines that surround prospects, veterans, and comebacks. I want baseball to thrive. But the sport has no urgency about its troubles \u2014 unlike Harley, which comes up with a reinvigoration plan every few years.\nHarley is now making a point of targeting younger riders with affordable bikes and electric models with zip, among other steps. So far, these steps haven\u2019t done much more than keep gas in a sputtering engine. But, as I said, at least they are trying, and finally there may be reason for hope.\nRevenue at Harley exceeded expectations the last two quarters and the stock was showing some lift before the war in Ukraine prompted the company (like some 500 others) to pull out of Russia. If the momentum stalls, you can be certain the company will try something else. You don\u2019t survive 119 years without adapting.\nUnless you are Major League Baseball.\nThat isn\u2019t entirely fair. I know. And as I said, I\u2019m not here to pile on. MLB has tinkered plenty. It lowered the pitching mound in 1968 and began using instant replay to overturn calls in 2008. This year, we have a designated hitter in the National League, duh, and the decidedly wired-world PitchCom to discourage sign stealing. We may not be far away from bigger changes like limited defensive shifts and larger bases.\nSo, baseball is trying. Kind of. Yet with no stock price to defend, MLB will take its sweet time. One wonders why baseball hasn\u2019t moved faster to defend its long-held and increasingly dubious claim as national pastime.\nI\u2019m not one to suggest that corporate thinking necessarily applies to problem solving outside the business world \u2014 say, in politics or with a legal monopoly like MLB. But perhaps baseball should borrow from Harley\u2019s latest playbook, designed precisely to revive an aging brand that has an aging customer base.\nHarley\u2019s five-year plan, termed The Hardwire, was introduced last year to burnish the company\u2019s \u201clifestyle brand\u201d and \u201cdrive desirability\u201d of its venerable product. Here are some components baseball might consider:\nInvest in our strongest segments Seems kind of obvious, right? Take what is working and make it more broadly accessible. The National Basketball Association has been especially good at this, expertly marketing aging superstars like LeBron James alongside new talent like Trae Young and Ja Morant. Baseball, meanwhile, has struggled to make household names of exciting young players like Vladimir Guerrero Jr. and Fernando Tatis Jr. The average age of an NBA viewer, by the way, is 42.\nExpand Selectively That means carefully, if at all. Does baseball really need to create new franchises in Las Vegas and Nashville, as has been discussed, while the ones in Tampa Bay and Miami play in nearly empty stadiums?\nTighten Inventory See above. You want excitement for your product? Don\u2019t flood the market. Harley is limiting new production as it enters the certified pre-owned world to capture younger riders \u2014 and it is working.\nOwn the future For Harley, that means developing the best electric motorcycles. MLB has been horrible at getting to the future first. The National Football League and NBA were light years ahead with instant replay review and novel camera angles. Boomers loved the baseball voices of the Vin Scully era, which is now over. But for years I thought baseball should offer a second broadcast with Millennial appeal.\nToday, there is opportunity to lead with robot umpires, which is being discussed but will not be fully integrated soon. No other sport except possibly tennis is so well built for tech-based officiating. Balls and strikes would be consistent. Strategically placed sensors would never miscall a bang-bang play at first base. Taking the guesswork out of close calls would speed up the game.\nGrow our connection with customers MLB is pretty good at milking its history and tradition. That\u2019s why robot umpires are problematic. Traditionalists like watching the manager kick dirt on an umpire\u2019s shoes. Home runs rescued the sport in the late 1990s. But now there are too many.\nHank Aaron once said, \u201cThe triple is the most exciting play in baseball.\u201d Well, in 2019, major leaguers hit a total 784 triples spread among 30 teams. There haven\u2019t been 1,000 triples in a season since 1983. Back in the 1920s, when there were just 16 teams and the sport was earning its place as the national pastime, the league recorded more than 1,000 triples every single year.\nCan we get some of that again?\nDan Kadlec is a former columnist at TIME.

But you won\u2019t read it here because the story of the 94th Oscars has moved quickly from shock and awe, to sort of funny, to real heavy. Holding my tongue now is the only safe strategy.\nMaybe the story will morph again. Maybe the edge will soften. Comedian Ricky Gervais just popped a new joke, saying he might rename his upcoming tour alopecia, instead of the working title Armageddon. But that\u2019s Ricky Gervais. My radar says it is too soon.\nIt was in that middle phase \u2014 sort of funny \u2014 that I sought to weigh in with humor. I spent days working on a sendup of what Will Smith was thinking in the minutes between The Slap and his acceptance speech. Even now, you can\u2019t miss the irony of Diddy, on stage to introduce a Godfather tribute, saying he would help \u201csolve that like family.\u201d\nThere was plenty to riff on. But by the time I finished writing, the moment for levity was gone. Serious media including The New York Times had devoted countless column inches to The Slap, using it to explore weighty themes around cancel culture, violence, and toxic masculinity. Much of the conversation has touched on matters of race. Humor was already a stretch for me. Race is truly out of my lane. I had to bow out.\nI discarded the fruit of many hours of hard work. It wasn\u2019t easy. But it was the right thing to do. I cringed upon the final reading of my column.

In the lobby. Suddenly I\u2019m hearing Russian conversations all around me during my stay in Dubai, giving the war, for me, a new dimension.\nCrowds shop western brands near GUM mall off Red Square in 2018. Photo by Dan Kadlec\nI don\u2019t speak Russian. But I know Russian speak, and I\u2019ve been hearing more of it here in Dubai, where I have been living the past few months. The language can sound harsh. But when spoken in hushed tones it has a velvety, elegant, almost hypnotic quality that renders it unmistakable.\nThe title character played by Jamie Lee Curtis in A Fish Called Wanda was so taken by the language that she responded erotically when John Cleese\u2019s character, Archie, spoke Russian gibberish in the hope of seducing her. I\u2019m no Wanda. But I always take note.\nReturning to Dubai after a recent flight, as I snaked through an endless line at immigration, a Russian father nearby was calling for his fidgety children to behave: \u201cDeti vedut sebya!\u201d he barked. Okay. I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s what he said. Because I don\u2019t speak Russian. But his kids fell in line pretty darn fast.\nOutside the airport, a young man who had been waiting with a colorful bouquet called out \u201cSolnishko!\u201d in obvious delight as he rushed to a young woman. I had to Google it. The translation was \u201clittle sun,\u201d a common Russian term of endearment. Later, at the hotel, a Russian family was checking in as I passed the front desk.\nThis crush of random encounters didn\u2019t seem like a coincidence. Yes, Russians have long emigrated to Dubai for jobs and the warm weather. Before the invasion of Ukraine, the Russian ex-pat community in Dubai already numbered in the tens of thousands. That number surely is growing.\nAt last count, 159 western companies had made a clean break from Russia while 182 had suspended all operations and may never resume.\nMuch is written about where Russian oligarchs are parking their superyachts and Gulfstream jets under threat of sanctions from the west. Dubai is one of those places. With a lot of Russian money, the yacht-building industry here has doubled the past eight years, and in recent weeks yacht traffic between Bluewaters and Palm Jumeirah in Dubai Harbor has felt like the Long Island Expressway at rush hour. Clashing wakes from floating 250-foot behemoths toss novice jet skiers like dinghies in a hurricane.\nBut ordinary Russians are on the move too. The families and the reuniting couple I saw were not oligarchs \u2014 and they were not on vacation. They were among the estimated 200,000 working-class folks who fled to Armenia, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates. Much of the UAE flow has been into Dubai. Demand has been so strong that one-way coach air fare from Moscow has risen five-fold to $1,800.\nI continue to encounter Russian emigres and speak to them when it feels appropriate. In the elevator, I commented on a small poodle that a middle-aged man was about to take for a walk. I\u2019m big on elevator convos; I enjoy interacting with strangers and have largely perfected the timing and how to graciously butt into someone\u2019s life. But this man was in no mood. He mumbled something in Russian without making eye contact. I knew that my gregariousness had failed and that his mind was heavy and far away.\n\u201cOh yeah,\u201d a little voice in my head said. \u201cNot everyone here is on a holiday.\u201d\nThe level of tragedy in the lives of fleeing Russians does not come close to approaching the horrors that Ukrainians are experiencing. Several million Ukrainians have lost everything and streamed into Poland, Moldova, Slovakia, and Hungary. Those who haven\u2019t fled are in a living hell. This unthinkable suffering is on the news 24\u20137 in graphic detail.\nThe experience of fleeing Russians is a less-told story, though one that increasingly is coming into focus as protestors in the motherland grow bolder, like Marina Ovsyannikova, who famously photo bombed a live newscast. Mainstream media has begun to report the exodus. But being in the middle of it, as a westerner, is both revealing and poignant.\nThe Russian refugees I have encountered are still in shock and largely reluctant to share details. In my limited sampling, their livelihoods had been tied to western companies with offices in Moscow that shut down with little warning. The lucky ones were given 48 hours to accept a ticket out, leaving almost everything they owned behind. Some hope to return one day.\nDimitri, a young man, left his mother and father behind. With no time to think the matter through, he hopped the next flight believing this nightmare would pass soon enough and he could go back to them. Yet hundreds of international companies are preparing for permanent shutdown. At last count, 159 western companies had made a clean break from Russia while 182 had suspended all operations and may never resume.\nWhen might Dimitri go home? Possibly never.\nAlina and Ivan have two young children. But they only had a passport for one, so the other child stayed behind with grandparents. They didn\u2019t know what else to do and had no time to consider their options. Their days are now consumed with searching for a path to reunite the family \u2014 whatever it takes. These are heartbreaking stories to hear first-hand.\nIn the west, many have a skewed vision of what life was like in Russia before Putin invaded Ukraine. Yes, it was restrictive. But freedoms were sprouting, and consumerism had a toehold. I was in Moscow in 2018 to report on Russia\u2019s financial literacy initiatives and found the city\u2019s degree of westernization startling. As I wrote at the time:\nDirectly across Red Square in the shadow of the Kremlin and St. Basil\u2019s Cathedral sits the Gum mall, a large shopping mecca boasting brands from Dior to Vuitton. You can buy a bag from Prada or sunglasses from Gucci, or just gather yourself at the Beluga Bar over black caviar. And it is busy. Very busy.\nConsumerism has found its way to Russia, and not just at the mall. Tourists travel to this city rich with culture from many countries, and the government likes what it sees. Shortly after the World Cup final here on July 15, President Vladimir Putin announced that the hundreds of thousands of football fans visiting from other countries may keep their \u201cfan pass\u201d credentials and return without a visa anytime they like through the end of the year.\nThis is the Russia that was \u2014 or almost was. Things were getting better. Globally minded Russian millennials were optimistic about their future. The Russians I interviewed then were young, proud, talkative, and full of energy. They were preparing the Russian masses to understand capitalist-style investments, and mortgages and other types of credit to build a better life.\nWe know now that a hideous, controlling evil lurked even then \u2014 and the Russia that was, is gone. Displaced ordinary Russians have a legitimate sense of tragic loss, even though their loss pales in comparison to that of Ukrainians.\nDan Kadlec is a former columnist at TIME.

Criticism is easy, but drawing a straight line to how poor quality reporting harms society is key: the line I\u2019d like to draw is not a new idea, but I\u2019m calling it media slide as a memorable shorthand to make the point.\nIt\u2019s well established that the new digital landscape pushes all online media to produce content to maximize clicks which drive ad revenues. Income in turn is the prime mover incentivizing dialing up the drama, confidently claiming impressive insights when they are little more than guesswork.\nTruth about our complex world is difficult to ascertain, and news reporters must confront events as they unfold when facts are particularly murky. This means that honest reporting faithfully presented is going to be uncertain and rather tepid reading because truth on the ground or behind closed doors is rarely subject to solid confirmation.\nAnd so between the reporters, columnists, and editors, our news gets gussied up: suppositions become assertions, likelihoods inevitabilities, and perhaps most perniciously, mind reading is commonplace. The reports based on mind reading all the time and we rarely notice it: a politician says they voted against a measure out of concern for the budgetary impact, and this is reported as being their true intention. (It shouldn\u2019t be necessary to say, but to clarify the point here, it\u2019s well known that everyone says things that don\u2019t reflect their inner thoughts, such as declining a dinner invitation because of \u201cplans\u201d when in fact they just don\u2019t want to attend.)\nHere\u2019s one very ordinary example of mind reading from \u201cthe paper of record\u201d just today.\nthe G.O.P.\u2019s Putin wing seems to be shaping the behavior of another major corporation \u2014 New York Times, The G.O.P.\u2019s Putin Wing\nCareful readers will note that it\u2019s couched with \u201cseems,\u201d but this sentence still claims a chain of causation (\u201cshaping\u201d) between politicians and corporation whose inner workings the reporter surely has no solid knowledge that would hold up to fact checking. In fact, the president of the corporation may have a well considered narrative, but still not truly know why a given decision was actually taken. Even those few careful readers who noticed the word \u201cseems\u201d in there will rarely later recall how it undercuts the certainty of the central point being made. Consciously or not, almost every reader is going to register in memory: in the end this lodges in our heads as, \u201cthe GOP right wing is driving Koch Industries.\u201d\nFrom here we can begin to see the media slide. All these little nudges in the reporting may be very minor sins, but for daily news watchers, they stack up over time, and eventually people notice that the media is playing games. This is what I call the media slide: tiny compromises lower quality bit and bit until the slope going down is too steep and people\u2019s trust slides right down to zero.\nThat\u2019s the image behind the slide, but of course everyone\u2019s reaction is slightly different. Pundits commonly advise us to check what \u201cthe other side\u201d(*) is saying about current events, and here\u2019s where the media slide gets interesting. Since all media is fighting for attention, it\u2019s all on the media slide. (Even paywalled sources need to prove their worth by outshining the freely available ad-supported websites, so these are in no way immune to the same forces.)\n(*) footnote \u2014 Viewing individuals along a simple left/right or Blue/Red spectrum is another pernicious commonplace that the media brandishes frequently, causing much damage, but that\u2019s a topic for another day.\nWhen you look at \u201cthe other side\u201d media, you are already approaching it defensively, so it\u2019s very easy to see these little tricks \u2014 and people quickly interpret it as willful deceit and get their guard up. This, in turn, makes us unreceptive to the entire message and dissuades us from spending much time. That is, we very quickly let ourselves slip down the slide to the bottom and get out of there. More importantly, we probably tend to think of the purveyors of such media as dishonest people pushing an agenda without regard for the truth or consequences.\nBut, psychologically, it\u2019s a very different story when the media is \u201con our side\u201d. Since these dishonest nudges are aligned with our predisposed notions, we don\u2019t notice them easily at all, and think that the article is quite reasonable. If anyone criticizes the reporting that\u2019s viewed as an attack on \u201cour side\u201d and the normal response is to defend, or perhaps acknowledge the problem while discounting it as a minor slip. More avid activists may even commend the writer for being brave and taking a chance in the interest of a great cause \u2014 you have to break eggs to make an omelette.\nReaders who oppose the GOP right wing want to think that they are in league with Koch Industries and likely find the assertion of a connection a certainty, with \u201cseems\u201d merely a touch of reporterly honesty acknowledging that they have no proof substantiating the claim. All of which is to say that when we like the sloppily reported message then we want to trust it so we hang onto the slide, because if we let ourselves slip backward then we have no credible news source and that\u2019s an unthinkable position to be in.\nIn summary, news media we hate appears to be a complete dumpster fire we have no faith in whatsoever, and at the same time are in denial about what news sources we do follow. Some folks (perhaps the wisest) give up on the news completely. Personally, I did to skim the headlines and occasionally wade into the reporting with a skeptical eye and only very rarely do I find any worthy of attention.\nIn the old days (pre-cable) there were three TV networks and they all competed for the American political center which forced them to repeat the news with relatively little spin and manipulation. Editors reasonably tried to keep the coverage balanced, and what nudges slipped in balanced out more or less. Viewers had choices but not too many, so they could watch critically and choose the best show with trustworthy anchors.\nCable changed that by offering 24/7 news and too many channels, inviting new media to target and chip off various target audiences. This soon led to going to extremes and outright sensationalism, none of which the American people were above rewarding with their attention. The internet capped that off with infinite channels and effectively zero cost so literally anyone can now produce and distribute media. Today we have millions of slippery meda slides.\nSo long as more clicks and more revenue govern what the news media publishes, the writing is inevitably going to suffer. Only when honesty (about how confusing the conflicting mix of information reporters are confronted with) and integrity are top priority and not subject to compromise is improvement possible.\nUntil the public wakes up (which is nigh impossible to even imagine happening) or possibly a billionaire chooses to selflessly fund a serious newsroom, expect the status quo to persist and our societal struggle with knowing anything with certainty and trusting any source of information to continue. But formerly unimaginable change begins one person at a time, so if a few of us can peer through the fog and see what\u2019s happening, just maybe that is the beginning of the end of this reprehensible state of the fourth estate.", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 0, "created_time": 1649355009528, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["News", "Media", "Trust", "Psychology"]}, {"author": "Loren Kohnfelder", "post_id": "1ef4b798e41e", "user_id": "97d33ee1186b", "title": "Truly Social Media", "content": "Truly Social Media\n\nEnvisioning a better social media may be the most important technical challenge of our time, because the promise of getting it right connects people in the right ways which in turn can revolutionize politics and spark innovation in literally any field of human endeavor. This is a hard design problem, both technically and, as a human interface, it must work for a diverse set of psychologies in order to succeed. I\u2019m grappling with understanding the problem space and writing to expand the discussion because it\u2019s important I believe that we must go well beyond conventional designs in order to get it right.\nI am under no delusion that I have this problem figured out, but in the best spirit of creative criticism I\u2019d like to reflect on this EFF article as an excellent starting point. Here\u2019s a great line from the piece about the stick network effects and high switching costs that has a lot of important background worth considering closely.\n\u201cBreaking up with the platform means breaking up with those people.\u201d\nThis is usually true in general, but the details are worth digging into because there are some hard truths behind it. Leaving Facebook, for instance, only means losing contact with people who can\u2019t be bothered to write you an email or even a letter from time to time. Perhaps the people you lose just don\u2019t care that much about you, or are not digitally competent, so they are intimidated learning alternatives once Facebook proves good enough. The article mentions that \u201ceveryone hates the content moderation on Big Tech platforms,\u201d but apparently most of us are indifferent to the ills of social media since they\u2019ve given up and accepted it. We don\u2019t want to penalize folks for their lack of digital savvy, so we hold our nose and keep using social media. Social connections make tackling the challenge all that much harder: ultimately it\u2019s a collective action problem.\nI was disappointed to see that the Fediverse (mentioned in the same EFF article) is already highly splintered, even before it gets off the ground. With so many platforms and protocols crowding the field, who can possibly assess the merits of all these options and make a smart choice? Just as the splintering of Linux distros handicaps the effort to displace the dominant commercial OS, all this no doubt well intentioned effort seems unlikely to make progress on the larger problem.\nThe article mentions a Hamilton/Jefferson model, but I think this duality is misleading: we need to finesse a path with elements of both and more. Fortunately, software is infinitely malleable so the space of possible solutions is boundless. Clearly the path forward needs to evolve because it\u2019s far bigger and harder than anything that a single genius can understand and solve. The many successes of the internet, large and small, have come from iterative trial and error enabled by platforms that are rich and flexible enough to foster experimentation.\nIt\u2019s important to resist attempting to simplify the challenge too soon in order to fit it into a problem description amenable to conventional digital concepts such as classification, filtering, and so forth. The in-person dynamics of human interactions are way too complex to be embodied in an algorithm. However, it\u2019s possible to build digital tools to empower humans to translate their social instincts into the online realm.\nThe article discusses social media challenges through the lenses of content moderation and communities, but I fear these may be too simplistic to be very meaningful. I can only speak for myself, but neither of these is particularly useful in thinking about the problem.\nWhether a piece of content is acceptable or not fundamentally depends on the context, and context itself varies according to the situation as well as over time. While I certainly don\u2019t want offensive content foisted on me, if I read about a controversial posting or a claim of unfair censorship then I might choose to seek it out in complete detail in order to judge for myself.\nWhile I consider myself a member of various communities, other than demographics that are not very salient in most contexts, these are not even well defined groups and each community is made of people with diverse backgrounds and personal standards. Even in a democracy we correctly limit enforcing standards of behavior on citizens as a last resort precisely because community members do not perfectly align on these complex questions. In any case, nobody is entitled to speak for an egalitarian community.\nWhat\u2019s left is the individual acting within the context of their choice. Social media must be freely available to all, reliable and efficient, and other than restricting content within the confines of law it needs to get out of the way.\nThe leading social media (in 2022) is difficult to take seriously. Sure, they have a commanding position thanks to being first movers (the first to get broad participation and survive, that is) but isn\u2019t it patently obvious that users are only there for the connections, not for the service itself? Today if one visits their websites they are either a walled garden or if not they pathetically beg the user to sign in or sign up for an account \u2014 and then to use their app \u2014 with unending prompts and teases, often leading to severe intentional feature hampering in a lame attempt to force people into submission. But if having an account and using the app is so great why do they need to sell it so hard?\nMaybe creating interoperable social media and then using regulatory powers to force Big Tech to support it is just too hard. There are certainly any number of reasons one can imagine such a strategy could fail to gain traction. If so, here\u2019s an alternative strategy that I think could work: get enough cool people to engage in a better social media and show off its success for the rest of us to gawk at. Maybe make participation invitation-only and exclusive (much like how Clubhouse got off the ground) and if it\u2019s the real thing people will be clamoring to join.\nIn the digital realm, people need good tools, so integration of third party components seems to be the one clear requirement for a better social media.

While I would never argue that it\u2019s simple, I have a hunch that the answer is to build better quality software \u2014 and the way to do this is to build much less of it.\nBut what exactly is \u201cbetter\u201d? My answer is that while this remains subjective, the prime directive must be to serve end users well. For media and communications software (to extend from the aforementioned article), first and foremost that means interoperable, reliable, free, and easy to use. Today\u2019s digital landscape is anything but that, and if we don\u2019t somehow set aside the profit motives of software companies (the current prime directive) we are going to be stuck in this dystopia of gatekeepers requiring us to all maintain numerous accounts with each entity (agreeing to one-sided terms, often paying recurring fees, and so on) while they cash in on networks effects and assert lock-in just because they can.\nWe as consumers could force this any day we like, but the reality is that most people don\u2019t want to think about this, much less forgo connections and entertainment to make a political gesture that without collective action would have no discernible effect.\nAnd how exactly do we create better software by making less of it? This part is even more challenging because it would require a sea change in the way software is conceived and built. Fortunately, it has actually been done before, for example in the case of the web browser. The history is a little messy, and I don\u2019t mean to suggest that only one web browser has even been developed, but I think that I can explain it.\nAnyone who remembers the early dot-com days when telephone modems made that distinctive sound connecting to dial-up internet service providers will remember the explosion of PC apps. People bought all kinds of special purpose software, and new PCs often sold with CDs full of apps that did all sorts of things. Had the World Wide Web not been invented, we may well have required separate apps for different incompatible internet services from various corporations and enterprises.\nFor a time, internet services such as AOL or Prodigy or Compuserve offered proprietary software to use their offerings. At Microsoft in the late 1990s, I was the program manager coordinating with these companies to integrate with Internet Explorer as a more standard hybrid \u2014 but the service providers still insisted on customizing the browser for their customers. Fortunately, all of this went by the wayside when it became clear that a single standard browser that worked for all websites was best.\nA parade of browser implementations followed and Internet Explorer has long since been dethroned, but the great achievement is the interoperability. Not that there is only one browser, but that with one browser an end user can suft the web in its entirety.\nTo be completely forthcoming, a few uppity websites have strict browser requirements but these are exceptions to the rule. Rarely these may have a good reason, but for the most part this just means they have cut corners on compatibility and testing. While the precise definition of a compliant web browser remains subjective, there is a good consensus and at minimum webpages should gracefully degrade and remain usable with the loss of some fancy bells and whistles. In any case, these may be considered exceptions to the rule \u2014 or a hard-nosed interpretation would just be that these websites are broken.\nBut web browsers are just an example of how we build interoperable technology \u2014 all the world\u2019s websites \u2014 on top of common infrastructure. Modern web browsers are impressive apps both in terms of their functionality and reliability. Compare this to the nightmare of every major corporation having a custom app for their corner of the internet. It took years and countless hours of development and testing to achieve our top browsers, resources only available because they are shareable across the entire web.\nWhat does this mean going forward, beyond the browser? In the article referenced, I mention instant messaging, video calling, and streaming, so this would mean a common client for each category that all competing services would interoperate with \u2014 instead of numerous incompatible apps by service. One way to do this would be to provide browser compatibility as some do already (e.g. meet.google.com for Google Meet video calling), but if this is too difficult or inefficient then one client per category of offering would be huge progress. (Anticipating a possible confusion, providing a thin client that requires proprietary plugins is not much better than separate apps.)\nHaving worked for many years in software security, I\u2019m instinctively defensive about software use. On the web, I get to choose my OS and my browser, which is a fair deal because nobody is telling me what software I have to use. Currently, if you invite me to a Zoom call, you are forcing me to install their app. (Not to pick on them, but they are featured in my recent experience, and Zoom weathered major security failings in 2020\u20132021. Notably, Zoom\u2019s security issues persist into 2022.) Just as I would never invite friends to dine with me at a restaurant with a reputation for giving diners foodborne illness, I wouldn\u2019t want to require them to install software that might open them up to a malicious attack. Far better, both practically and ethically, to let them choose their own software, and interoperability ensures just that.\nNaturally, providers want to make a profit, and they can do this by charging a fee for hosting or for content, so long as the client is free and open. As an analogy, Adobe gives away Acrobat Reader so everyone can see PDF files, but charges for full Acrobat or otherwise licenses the technology to create PDFs.\nSoftware standards have a complicated history and certainly have their shortcomings. So an important question to address is when it makes sense to offer non-standard functionality in the interest of innovation. There is no easy answer to this subjective question, but I think that the pragmatic answer is to leave it to the end user to choose. That is, the basic functionality should just work \u2014 that\u2019s interoperability \u2014 but if someone installs the special app in order to get some enhanced features, that\u2019s fine: just don\u2019t force them. For multi-client apps like video calling, if special software allows you to augment our video signal giving you cat ears, be my guest so long as I can see it with a standard client. If someone invents a way to shake hands with haptic gloves and special software, go for it, but on my standard client please display a message \u201cshaking hands now\u201d (with a link explaining how I can join in) so I\u2019m not completely out of the loop.\nThat\u2019s my radical vision that I believe would transform the software landscape. Interoperability does require standards, specifications, sharing common components, and interoperability testing. Yet if we shared common code we could focus on building a few world class implementations instead of dozens (hundreds, or thousands?) of mediocre ones. End users would love the interoperability and simplicity \u2014 one free install, one user interface to learn. We can build this, all we have to do is give up dreams of world domination with proprietary software and protocols. If whatever features distinguish one competitive digital service from another are so amazing, then offer basic interop and try selling that technology as an upgrade.\nDone right, we get rich digital services that (unlike today) just work.", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 1, "created_time": 1647217990737, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Interoperability", "Software", "Quality"]}, {"author": "Gina Denny", "post_id": "1b454456ebb3", "user_id": "36e5dbd8fe55", "title": "What Twilight Did Right", "content": "What Twilight Did Right\nDunk on it all you want \u2014 it sold 120 million copies and made $3.4 billion at the box office. You can learn from it.\n\nPeople love to dunk on the Twilight books, and their reasons are always the same:\nThe relationship is abusive and toxic and dangerous\nThe writing is bad\nThey\u2019re dumb\nNumber three is steeped in our favorite American pastime: hating things teen girls love. That\u2019s not a real reason, so I\u2019m dismissing it entirely.\nNumber two is subjective but I can say confidently that there are plenty of worse-written books being traditionally published. You might dislike some of her writing quirks, like having lots of em-dashes (particularly in conversations) or using simple and straightforward language, but that doesn\u2019t make it automatically bad. Hemingway used straightforward simple language and Emily Dickinson toyed with \u2018creative\u2019 punctuation. Style choices are subjective and some of the greats have made questionable style choices.\nNumber one is worth debating, especially if you have a teen in your life who you care about. Defining toxic relationships is important, but A) defining this particular relationship as \u201cabusive\u201d usually ignores the fact that he\u2019s an actual monster and she\u2019s a human trying to survive in a monster world and B) this is hardly the only book series in which an immortal man falls in love with a teen girl. I don\u2019t think I manage to go six months without reading a book with a multi-century age gap in it that no one has complained about. Immortal, impossibly rich, impossibly strong men are a trope and a fantasy all rolled into one. Gross? Maybe. But Twilight isn\u2019t to blame for it. Lash out at\u2026 the entire publishing industry, and maybe society as a whole, I guess.\nImage \u00a9 Summit Entertainment, 2008\nI personally believe that a lot of the judgment around the series is actually aimed at the movies, not the books. The movies were plagued by low budgets, a writer\u2019s strike, an inconsistent team at the helm, and a rapid-release schedule that sought to capitalize on a fad rather than making quality films. Many of the things people make fun of (the depressing tone, \u201cI know what you are\u2026\u201d, \u201chop on spidermonkey\u201d, awkward silences and excessive blinking\u2026) are all from the films only; none of it is in the books.\nDefining Success\nEven if you stand firm in your opinion that these are bad books, for whatever reason, the fact remains that they have sold a combined total of 120 million copies and spawned a movie and merch fandom that has brought in just over $3.4 billion-with-a-B. Stephenie Meyer reportedly made just over $50,000,000 in just 2009.\nMaybe you don\u2019t care about commercial success. Maybe you care that your stories connect with fans. One look at all the fanart, merch, and fan clubs will tell you that people connected with the Twilight stories, maybe in a way that they hadn\u2019t connected with novels\u2026 ever? I don\u2019t know, maybe I\u2019m too young to remember a time in which hoards of people were so enthusiastic about a book that they wanted to buy shirts so badly that they resorted to making their own\u2026 just for the book launch party at their local bookstore. Like, yeah, maybe a few dozen people did that for some book in the 90s, but hundreds? Thousands at a time?\nBottom line: People connected with these stories.\nWhichever way you define success \u2014 whether commercially, financially, or by the way people connect with your stories \u2014 Twilight was successful.\nWhy, though?\nDismissing these stories as \u201cwell, popular stuff is always dumb, people are dumb, teenagers are sheep\u201d is deeply offensive and flat-out false. You might not be writing YA paranormal romance, but you can learn from Meyer and her writing.\nYes. You can.\nWhat Twilight Did Right\nChapters end on absolute bangers\nWhen discussing what Twilight does well, most people will go directly to \u201cpacing.\u201d And while that\u2019s true, it\u2019s tougher to nail down the specifics. These books yank you through the story, and while her beats and plotting are part of it, I think her chapter endings are actually the thing you can mimic here.\nA collection of lines that close out some chapters:\nThat was the first night I dreamed of Edward Cullen.\n\u201cNow,\u201d he said significantly, \u201cIt\u2019s your turn.\u201d\nI wouldn\u2019t forget.\nCould he really believe in the impossible legends his son had scoffed at? Yes. Yes he could.\nEdward seemed to take a deep breath, and then he stepped out into the bright glow of the midday sun.\n\u201cCome on then,\u201d he encouraged. \u201cI\u2019ll show you.\u201d\nAnd then I sealed away my heart.\nDazed and disoriented, I looked up from the bright red blood pulsing out of my arm \u2014 into the fevered eyes of the six suddenly ravenous vampires.\nI did not resurface.\nGoodbye, I love you, was my last thought.\nI blinked into the sudden light, and saw that someone was there, waiting for me.\nWe couldn\u2019t get through the ornate door at the end of the hallway before the screaming began.\nThat\u2019s just from the first two books. Even out of context, those lines all share a few characteristics. First, they\u2019re short and punchy. Second, they all hint at or flat-out promise doom or adventure right around the corner.\nShort and punchy fits the genre of YA paranormal romance, and it also speaks to a fast pace in the story. Long, poetic sentences beg you to read slowly, to immerse yourself in the language. Short, punchy sentences invite you to read quickly, to focus on plot, to always be looking for what\u2019s next.\nThe hint of doom or adventure isn\u2019t a secret; every story has to hint that there\u2019s more coming in the future, or else you wouldn\u2019t keep turning the pages. But what Meyer does in all these examples is promise that either doom or adventure is coming like right now. It makes you want to get to the next chapter immediately. Even if the promise isn\u2019t fulfilled on the next page, you\u2019ve already psychologically committed yourself to \u2018reading another chapter\u2019 so you keep going. And then find yourself face-to-face with yet another banger of a closing line and the next thing you know you\u2019ve been reading for nineteen hours straight and haven\u2019t eaten anything but sliced cheese and dry cereal because you can\u2019t put the book down.\nAhem.\nThere\u2019s a balance between the magical and the mundane\nBella spends a lot of time doing very boring, normal teenage things. She does chores and homework. She listens to petty gossip and tries to make friends at a new school. She reads paperback novels and listens to music in her room.\nAll this mundane activity grounds the story in reality, makes the reader feel like they can relate to Bella. They\u2019ve been dress shopping for prom! They\u2019ve been in a silent fight with some girl at school and they don\u2019t know why! They have to do their laundry!\nSprinkled in with the mundane, though, is the magical. In this case, there\u2019s the literal magic of vampires and werewolves (shapeshifters), but there\u2019s also the \u2018normal\u2019 magic of falling in love for the first time.\nIf Bella arrived in Forks and then literally everything about her world turned upside down, it wouldn\u2019t be as intriguing of a story. If she was turned into a vampire the very next day, thrown in front of the Volturi, and forced to broker peace between shapeshifters and vampires \u2026 it would be a very different book. It might be good, it might even sell well, but I really do think it\u2019s the constant teeter-tottering between \u201cI\u2019m trying so hard to be a normal teenager\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m in love with a monster and his world will kill me\u201d that makes the story so exciting to read.\nThe stories were diverse long before it was \u201ctrendy\u201d\nDiversity shouldn\u2019t be seen as trendy. You know it, I know it. But publishing is a business and businesses are always going to treat any shift or change as a trend to capitalize on. I hope the recent push for diverse stories makes permanent changes to the publishing landscape. So many people have done so much work, and that work deserves to be recognized and rewarded with long-term, permanent success.\nOn the pages of Twilight, almost a decade before the We Need Diverse Books foundation was launched, Meyer wrote about poverty, broken families, mental health struggles, disability, racial diversity, income inequality, and the effects of an unfair education system.\nIs Meyer perfect at any of this? No.\nI\u2019m not the expert on almost any of these communities or identities, so I\u2019ll leave it to others to speak much more eloquently than I can on these topics.\nBut she was doing it without public pressure and without a hashtag to encourage her.\nHer depiction of situational depression is heartbreaking, just empty pages with nothing but the names of the months passing by, one at a time, demonstrating the loneliness and hopelessness of depression. Bella went to school and did all the things she was supposed to do, but she was a shell of herself. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen depression depicted so brutally honestly before or since in a YA book without it being an \u2018issue\u2019 book in which the author is campaigning for better mental health supports or suicide prevention.\nThey\u2019re funnier than you remember\nThe films are so solemn that it\u2019s easy to forget that the books are funny. Bella has a New Girl/Zooey D/Jess Day vibe and Edward is clever and Alice especially is very witty.\nA lot of the imitators that came after Twilight were imitators of the films as much as they were the books, or else they sought to be darker as a way to differentiate themselves from Twilight. Other paranormal romances from the late 00s and early 10s were darker, more violent, more somber. There was a lot less humor and a lot more sex. They tended to follow the footsteps of the Sookie Stackhouse stories (which were also a lot funnier than the TV show True Blood was).\nExample:\n\u201cBreakfast time,\u201d he said eventually, casually \u2014 to prove, I\u2019m sure, that he remembered all my human frailties.\nSo I clutched my throat with both hands and stared at him with wide eyes. Shock crossed his face.\n\u201cKidding!\u201d I snickered. \u201cAnd you said I couldn\u2019t act!\u201d\nHe frowned in disgust. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t funny.\u201d\n\u201cIt was very funny, and you know it.\u201d\nAlice (who can see the future) and Edward (who can read her mind) sit down to play chess. They both sit perfectly still for a couple minutes while she predicts every move he\u2019ll make and he reads her mind. Then she knocks over her queen, forfeits, and walks away from the game.\nI don\u2019t care who you are \u2014 THAT SHIT IS HILARIOUS. There are not enough stories in which superpowered characters use their superpowers for silly things. I know it happens, but not often enough, and Meyer did that.\nA super-strong vampire held up a car so his wife could lay on the ground and work on the engine. Like, he just sat there and held the car up with one hand. That is funny, and nothing like that made it into the movies.\nThey fulfilled their promises\nTwilight is a young adult paranormal romance. Every one of those qualifiers comes with a certain set of promises and expectations.\nYoung adult fiction is marketed at teenagers, almost always with a teen protagonist and a set of problems that normal teens face. Moving to a new school, falling in love for the first time, trying to get along with a non-custodial parent. All things that teens experience.\nYoung adult fiction, like other kidlit categories, often uses self-inserting protagonists. The protagonists are pretty vanilla so that readers can insert themselves into the shoes of the protagonist without feeling alienated. Bella is supposed to be kinda boring and unremarkable. That\u2019s not a bug; it\u2019s a feature.\nParanormal romance is inherently kinda dark and kinda problematic. Can a human ever really consent with a vampire? Or a demon king? Or a vampire-hunter? Sex and violence get all tangled up, the lines between fighting and falling in love blurring.\nTwilight delivers on those promises. It doesn\u2019t pretend to be something it\u2019s not. There\u2019s no condescension. It steps into the tropes and fulfills them all.\nPopularity is its Own Kind of Death Sentence\nIn the end, I honestly think Twilight takes the sheer volume of criticism it does because it was way too popular way too fast. Meyer was the bestselling author of the 2000s and she didn\u2019t even release her first book until 2005. Three years later, the first film was the 8th-highest grossing film in America (behind Batman, Iron Man, Indiana Jones, a Pixar movie, Hancock, Kung Fu Panda, and a Madagascar sequel). Five years from the release of the first book, the third movie was the most widely-released movie in U.S. history, playing on more than 4,400 screens on opening day. Within seven years of the release of the first book, the Twilight franchise was worth more than three billion dollars.\nThat\u2019s $3,000,000,000.00 or roughly 4,000 times what Meyer was paid for the books in the first place.\nThat\u2019s a hell of a lot of success in a really short time.\nAdd in the fact that these books appealed mainly to teenaged girls and made exactly zero apologies for that and you can see why the backlash was so widespread. America loves nothing more than to hate the things that teenaged girls love, and here was a thing that teenaged girls loved a whole lot more than they loved anything else.\nYes, there were adult women who crossed serious boundaries by making ultra-creepy comments about the character Jacob Black (and by extension, teenaged Taylor Lautner). That was unacceptable behavior.\nYes, the movies were poorly made.\nYes, the books are light reads. They aren\u2019t full of dense, intricate prose and heavy literary themes.\nYes, it\u2019s worth discussing the problematic elements of Bella\u2019s romantic entanglements. But remember that Bella punches Jacob in the face when he kisses her without her consent. Edward constantly tells her that he\u2019ll leave if she asks him to, and then he really does leave when he thinks it\u2019s for the best but she\u2019s incapable of asking him to. And Bella is a breakable human surrounded by vampires. The gender-swapped version worked. A female vampire saving her human boyfriend made sense. Compared to vampires, humans are frail.\nBut creepy fans are not the fault of the author or the publisher; these books had been marketed to teens. If adult women cannot control themselves, that is 100% on them and you should call out and shame anyone who behaves that way.\nTwilight is far from the only book with a problematic romance at its heart. Hell, the Mortal Instruments books were being published around the same time and the author kept the audience believing that the main romance was incestuous for two and a half books.\nYou can dislike the books, you can ignore the books, you can advocate against them if you want.\nBut you have to admit they were successful, and that success was because they did a lot of things right.\nFollow me on Twitter for education, feminism, and writing.

Six weeks after the school year started, I quit over a payroll dispute that the school refused to acknowledge or repair. I loved my job, I loved those kids, and I was heartbroken that this was how it was going to end.\nI got my advanced groups to their first performance of the year, but that performance was my last day. It was a night full of tears and hugs and music (I was the band, orchestra, and drumline director) and I thought I could not be more proud of those Gen Z goofballs than I was that night. Their performance went perfectly, the crowd responded warmly, and the after party in my classroom went on for a couple hours. But then I had to clear everyone and lock up and turn in my keys and that was that.\nMy son still attended the school, and our community is very tight-knit, so I stayed connected to the kids and the school. I saw the fall plays and I was tagged in pics and videos of performances and events throughout the semester. Students sent messages when they were accepted to college and when they signed up to audition for honor ensembles.\nBut all was not paradise.\nThe teacher who came after me had a very different philosophy than I did when it came to these kids.\nThe school is in a moderate-income neighborhood in a minority-majority district. When I left, I taught six classes. In two of those classes, I was the only white person in the room. A huge percentage of my students were either immigrants or the children of immigrants. More than half spoke a language other than English at home.\nMusic education wasn\u2019t a long-standing tradition in most of these families. Families that had arrived in the U.S. as refugees or as immigrants who didn\u2019t speak the language, they simply didn\u2019t have the resources to insist their children learned to play the cello. Music was a nice addition to their lives, and they supported it, but too many families were struggling to put food on the table for me to expect them all to shell out for private music lessons. They relied on the free program through the school and that would have to be enough.\nFor me, it was enough. I saw my job as:\n- Teach the kids to love music, art, and the people who make it\n- Teach the kids that they can do hard things\n- Teach the kids that they can make beautiful things\n- Teach the kids to be part of an ensemble, something bigger than themselves\n- Teach the kids that hard things can be great, joyful, and important while still being fun\nYes, I taught the technical aspects of music. It\u2019s necessary to teach the technical aspects if you expect musicians to ever play a piece together. But in addition to the technical aspects, I taught them to love music and to love making music.\nWhen they struggled to learn to play the instrumental version of \u201cWe Are the Champions\u201d I had them put their instruments down, stand up, and scream-sing along with the song. \u201cIf you can\u2019t feel it in your bones, then you\u2019ll never be able to play it the right way. No one can sing worse than me, SCREAM IT!\u201d and they did. They screamed. They got that song into their bones and they played it with so much passion and verve that I got weepy over it.\nWeepy over \u201cWe Are the Champions\u201d played by violins. Never let it be said that I\u2019m not in touch with my emotions.\nThe teacher who came after me didn\u2019t think this was an appropriate way to run a music program.\nHe expected everyone to be in private lessons or else they should quit the ensemble. He expected everyone in high school to be honor-ensemble-ready. He wanted decorum, propriety, and serious study of the classical repertoire only. No funk, no jazz, no pop, no rock, nothing newer than Mahler.\nThis was a difficult set of differences to reconcile.\nThe Inevitable Breakdown\nEvery December, the community has what we call \u201cthe Santa drop\u201d. Santa drops out of a helicopter onto the high school football field and then does pictures with all the kids. This event has grown to have thousands of attendees, a craft fair featuring local businesses, and performances by the performing arts groups. Dance, choir, orchestra, and the drama club creates a \u201cset\u201d for Santa to take pictures on while the yearbook/photography club takes those pictures and sells them as a fundraiser.\nIt\u2019s an AWESOME event. I was there as a member of the community and a parent of a kid in the drama program during the December after I left the classroom. It was bittersweet to be on the outside of an event that used to run me ragged.\nThe orchestra was scheduled to perform last, but a few minutes before the performance, the new teacher decided to cancel it.\nThey were missing a few students (this happens on a Saturday event; families decide not to attend and you just gotta roll with it) and he refused to put on a performance without his entire ensemble. When the students said they wanted to perform, wanted their friends and family to see what they had worked so hard on, he said (and I heard this with my own ears), \u201cYou haven\u2019t worked hard, none of you. You don\u2019t deserve to perform.\u201d\nAnd then he locked himself in his office. He managed to tell me that I wasn\u2019t welcome anywhere near this school, despite the fact that my son attended the school.\nThe kids were \u2026 everything. They were furious and hurt and upset and disappointed and resigned to their fate.\nOne of the other parents came up to me and asked if I would lead the group for their performance. I knew the piece (I had composed the arrangement, after all) and the kids trusted me. I demurred, mostly because I didn\u2019t want to exacerbate the tensions between the kids and their new teacher. Things were rough, but me inserting myself into the situation wasn\u2019t going to help.\nThen came the moment that made me sob.\nThe kids decided to put on the performance themselves. They came out in front of their friends and family and set up their stage.\nOne student stepped up to the microphone to introduce the group and the piece they were going to play. His voice was shaky with nerves, but he got through the introduction.\nThen another student stepped up to the front of the group, raised his hands and began conducting.\nThe kids were rattled; anyone would be after being told they didn\u2019t \u201cdeserve\u201d to perform. But they played their entire piece. The jitters got shaken out and they finished strong.\nThat.\nThat was what I wanted to teach those kids.\nI wanted them to learn that they could do whatever they wanted to do, that they deserved to be proud of their work, and that they didn\u2019t need to scrounge for someone\u2019s approval. They were worthy. They were talented. They deserved love and attention from people who cared about them.\nDifferent Set of Standards\nMy music program didn\u2019t have record-breaking numbers of kids who made it into honor ensembles. We didn\u2019t win state competitions and we struggled to get enough kids to qualify for a Disneyland workshop.\nOnly four of my 186 students were enrolled in private lessons.\nYes, I taught them to play Mozart and Stravinsky. But I also led them through Mariah Carey, Queen, and a whole mess of Broadway tunes. They learned to play bossa nova\u2026 but it was Hooked on a Feeling.\nBut those kids knew that I cared.\nThose kids knew that someone believed in them.\nSomeone believed so much that they knew they were worthy even after that person wasn\u2019t in charge anymore.\nAnd that is the goal of teaching, isn\u2019t it? To make those kids feel so loved and so valued that they can take the lessons we taught them and apply them to the rest of their lives. It\u2019s not about music and it\u2019s not about math. It\u2019s about knowing that they can do hard things, that hard things are great, and that they are worthy of love and attention.\nFollow me on Twitter for education, feminism, and writing.

Beat sheets are useful tools to determine when in your story something should happen, but ultimately the question you need to answer is what happens and to whom.\nThe \u201cwhom\u201d part is pretty easy: your protagonist, mostly. \nThe \u201cwhat\u201d part is the impossible part. Literally anything could happen. You\u2019re the one making this all up.\nSo how do you know what needs to happen?\nIf you\u2019ve chosen a protagonist, then you either have the beginning of their story in mind, or you have the end of their story in mind.\nThe TV show Heroes started with a tagline: Save the cheerleader, save the world. Alright, so that\u2019s the end of the protagonist\u2019s story: he saves the cheerleader.\nOn How I Met Your Mother, the ending was decided before the show started. Yes, the protagonist would meet the mother of his children, but the show was How I Met Your Mother, not How Your Mother and I Built a Life Together. The writers went into the show with the explicit purpose of writing to that specific ending.\nMost of the time, though, you probably have your protagonist\u2019s beginning all sorted out instead. Gilmore Girls was pitched as \u201ca mother and daughter but they\u2019re best friends\u201d. That\u2019s a beginning to the story, but says absolutely nothing about how the end is going to happen.\nThen, of course, there are the characters for whom you have their beginning and their end both sorted from the start. Harry Potter, Luke Skywalker, Alexander Hamilton, and that Eragon kid are all poor orphan boys with a secret destiny to fulfill.\nAnd those orphan boy heroes offer up a good segue here.\nThe \u201corphan boy has a secret destiny to fulfill\u201d is a character and plot all rolled into one.\nThat pitch, generic as it is, gives you a protagonist, a hook, and a resolution all at once. Importantly, the resolution mirrors the hook. Harry Potter at the beginning of the story is an abused orphan toiling in obscurity, but at the end of the story he is the most famous wizard in the world who defeated wizard Hitler. Luke Skywalker starts as a bored, restless orphan working on a desert planet and ends up a galactic hero who defeated space Hitler during a battle on a forest planet/moon thing. You get the idea.\nThe resolution in those orphan boys\u2019 stories mirrors the hook. It\u2019s sort of the opposite, but not completely. They\u2019re all still orphaned at the end of their story, after all.\nLet\u2019s look at Gilmore Girls.\nAt the beginning of the story, Lorelai and Rory are best friends. Lorelai and Emily are not on speaking terms. Lorelai is fiercely independent, Rory is wildly ambitious, and Emily is so concerned about appearances and her reputation that she has stifled any meaningful relationships.\nBy the end of the story, Lorelai and Rory are close, but they\u2019ve drifted so much that Lorelai can\u2019t even begin to guess who the father of Rory\u2019s baby is. Lorelai and Emily are on speaking terms and have a positive rapport that is healing a lot of the damage to their relationship. Lorelai has deep, strong roots and has learned to treasure her support system. Rory has scaled back her ambitions and is chasing something smaller, more personal. And Emily has literally sworn off her precious reputation in favor of a life that is noisy, comfortable, and fairly wild by comparison.\nKnowing the end gives you the beginning, and knowing the beginning gives you an end.\nBuilding the Bookends\nStructurally, there are a lot of ways you can play with this, and Gilmore Girls, luckily enough, gives us two different versions of an ending.\nThe showrunners had an end in mind, a plan for Rory mostly. That plan got significantly derailed by the showrunners\u2019 departure for the seventh season. The new writers used what was already there and pivoted the story, moving towards an ending they liked better. Then, in 2016, the original showrunner worked with Netflix to create A Year in the Life, a limited run series that serves to mostly right the ship that had listed badly during season seven.\nSo there are two endings to the show. One that incorporates some of the original vision, but mostly went off the rails, and one that uses the off-the-rails story to build toward that original vision once more.\nLucky for us, we get to analyze both and see how they mirror the Pilot episode in different ways.\nThe Season Seven Finale\nBy the way, you can view a spreadsheet of these comparisons here. The season seven finale and the AYITL finale are on two separate tabs. Green boxes are plot points or emotional beats that are perfectly mirrored between the finale and the pilot. Orange boxes are plot points or emotional beats that are inverted from the pilot to the finale. For example: Rory gets into Chilton in the pilot, and Rory gets a job in the season seven finale. That\u2019s a perfect mirror. But Lorelai asks her parents for money and despises the conditions her parents put on the money in the pilot, and in the finale she refuses their money but agrees to the conditions anyway. That\u2019s an inversion.\nIn the pilot, Rory is single but on the brink of a new romance, ready to throw away her future for that romance. In the finale, she is newly single after ending a long-term romance and being unwilling to throw away her dreams for that romance.\nIn the pilot, Lorelai is fiercely independent and prideful. In the finale, she has accepted all kinds of help from her parents, Luke, Sookie in order to build her life.\nIn the pilot, Rory has big dreams and in the finale, she has done everything she can to be ready for those dreams and has been offered a dream job.\nIn the pilot, Lorelai has dreams of opening her own inn, and by the finale, her inn is so successful that she\u2019s been headhunted and doesn\u2019t even need money from her parents to expand, if she wants.\nThe story had to build to this point, had to take twists and turns, but the ending is still satisfying because Rory, Lorelai, and Emily have changed so much since the pilot.\nThe season seven finale focuses more on mirroring the pilot in a very direct way. Partly, this is obviously because the two episodes are in the exact same format. They are both 44-minute episodes with predetermined commercial breaks. The opening shots are both aerial shots of Lorelai arriving someplace, the closing shots are both pullaway shots of Lorelai and Rory sitting in Luke\u2019s while it\u2019s dark outside.\nThe AYITL Fall Finale\nThe AYITL episodes are formatted differently. It runs for an hour and forty-one minutes, for starters, and has no obvious commercial breaks. AYITL was filmed to be much more cinematic than the first seven seasons, and therefore takes wild detours in pacing. Rory\u2019s antics with the Life and Death Brigade boys (c\u2019mon guys\u2026 you\u2019re in your thirties, grow up) takes up a huge amount of time, for example.\nWith the passage of time (this is sixteen years after the pilot aired) and the change in format and the show reverting back to the original creator, the parallels between pilot and finale are quite different, though still significant. This finale has more inversions than the season seven finale, focusing more on how the characters have changed, rather than on the things that made the audience feel comfortable.\nAnd that really is the difference between the two types of mirrors: a true mirror makes the audience feel comfortable whereas an inversion allows the audience to appreciate how far your character has come. One feels very \u201cfull circle\u201d and the other feels like you\u2019ve completed a long journey together.\nBoth are satisfying, both fulfill the demands of the audience. It depends on what type of story you\u2019re trying to tell.\nFollow me on Twitter for education, feminism, and writing.

He\u2019s had a phone since he was twelve, with gradually increasing levels of freedom on the phone.\nWhen my son\u2019s grades began to slip, we looked at how he was spending his time and a lot of it was on his phone. After a discussion with him about why we were doing this, we put automatically-enforced time limits on social media, games, YouTube, and his creative apps. To our surprise, he seemed relieved.\nAfter a week or so, he was negotiating to get some time back on his creative apps (he hopes to be a voice actor someday and spends a lot of time practicing accents, recording himself, playing with sound effects, and learning how to manipulate his voice). He wanted time to do the thing he loved, but he didn\u2019t even bother asking for social media, games, and YouTube.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t really miss it that much,\u201d he said when we asked. \u201cPlus, I\u2019ve been getting all my stuff done without being stressed or rushed and that\u2019s been nice.\u201d\nThe fact that his grades began to rise almost immediately (it was the right time in the semester for one or two good assignments to make a big impact on the bottom line) and he was able to spend a lot more time working on his lines for the school play also helped play a role in his attitude, I\u2019m sure.\nWe had limited his time on certain types of apps, but we couldn\u2019t take the entire phone away.\nHis phone is his only way to reach us. There are no pay phones anywhere in our town and teachers\u2019 phones are (rightfully) out-of-bounds for students to use.\nHis phone is his only way to reach his friends. None of his friends \u2014 zero \u2014 have a home phone.\nEven before the pandemic, teachers used phones as a way to play interactive games during test review periods. Blooket and Kahoot are two of the most popular interactive instructional review games, but there are plenty others. One geography teacher required the kids to join Sporcle and compete with each other on geography quizzes to earn points in class.\nI\u2019m sure these teachers found workarounds for kids who didn\u2019t have phones, but at the high school level, 95% of high schoolers had a smartphone in 2018. That number is surely even higher now, four years (and two years of a pandemic) later.\nThe pandemic sent kids home to do school through their devices and we quickly learned that while almost every single kid in America had access to a smartphone, not enough had access to a laptop or reliable high-speed internet at home. The pandemic forced teachers to use more virtual classroom tools like Google Classroom. It forced teachers to create downloadable content or videos.\nMany schools spun this as a positive: \u201cWe were gonna have to learn how to do all this newfangled computer stuff eventually, let\u2019s be grateful that we have extra time to work on it now, when you\u2019ve been relieved of your coaching and extracurricular activities!\u201d While a good boss will try to spin a difficult situation and see the positive side of it, what this ended up doing was making teachers think \u201cI spent all that time building my Google Classroom/Website/Downloadable Curriculum\u2026 I better use it all the time and forever.\u201d\nSo now all three of my older boys \u2014 sixth, seventh, and eleventh grades \u2014 are required to log into Google Classroom every single day. Worksheets are no longer printed out, they\u2019re filled out as Google forms. Reading logs are no longer in the back of three-ring binders, they\u2019re Google sheets with a tab for every academic quarter.\nWith the phone required for school work and as a necessity to reach his family and friends, we couldn\u2019t take the phone away entirely. The phone had stopped being a privilege, if it really ever had been one, and had become just a tool. A device.\nA thing they need to have, whether they really want it or not.\nLess than a third of teens say their smartphone is a positive presence in their life.\nEarly in 2022, I was tapped to speak to the teen girls in our church about emotional self-care. We discussed the things that stress them out \u2014 grades, parents, friends, and the nebulous concept of \u201ceverything\u201d \u2014 and how they can deal with those things. I gave them pointers on time management and I gave them the best advice the internet has ever given me: If you feel like you hate everyone, you need to eat better. If you feel like everyone hates you, you need to sleep better. If you feel like everyone hates everyone, you need to go touch grass.\nTo wrap up my time with them, I talked very briefly about social media. I said, very plainly, \u201cSocial media is supposed to be fun.\u201d\nAnd when I tell you those girls all scoffed, I mean it. You can\u2019t imagine the volume of that scoff, considering the group wasn\u2019t very big. They did not see social media as \u201cfun\u201d. So why do 97% of teens have a social media account?\nFor the same reason you do.\nI signed up for social media in the early 00s to keep in touch with friends who were scattered around the world for our college years. When MySpace and LiveJournal gave way to Facebook and mommy blogs, I went along because why not? When I first signed up for Twitter in very early 2009, it was out of curiosity more than anything. I used it as a pop culture news feed in my early days of motherhood; I couldn\u2019t watch actual news or non-Disney entertainment, but I found out Michael Jackson died through my twitter feed.\nBut damn if these days I don\u2019t find myself questioning why I\u2019m still on social media. To promote my writing, sure. But people had careers as writers before the social internet, right? So that can\u2019t be my only motivation. To keep in touch? Maybe, but I unfriended almost everybody because it turns out I really don\u2019t want to know what my high school boyfriend\u2019s younger brother\u2019s best friend thinks about the policing of racial minorities in America.\nSo why do I keep it?\nBecause I sort of feel like have to.\nI take measures to protect my mental health. I don\u2019t follow any beauty influencers under 40 or any fashion influencers smaller than a size 12. I block, mute, and unfollow at the slightest provocation because I can. I report harassers, bots, spammers, and assholes as often as possible. I report weight loss ads as \u201coffensive\u201d.\nBut those are all defense mechanisms carefully honed over two and a half decades of being on the social internet (good god I\u2019m too old for this shit).\nKids don\u2019t have those carefully honed defense mechanisms, for several reasons:\nThey don\u2019t know they need them. The first time I consciously unfollowed social media accounts that were making me feel bad about myself was in 2014, more than five years after I first logged on to modern social media sites. It took me, an adult with pretty solid self-awareness, five whole years to figure out why my phone was making me feel bad sometimes. My son hasn\u2019t even had a phone for five years, much less social media, and much MUCH less the awareness of how certain aspects of social media make him feel.\nTheir needs are constantly shifting. I\u2019m an over-30 white lady who wears size fourteen pants and lives near the precarious edge of middle-class. That\u2019s been true for nearly a decade, and as I age, my insecurities aren\u2019t likely to shift much. I will get older, I will stay chubby, and for a lot of reasons I will never live a financially aspirational life. A fifteen-year-old girl has different pressures than a nineteen-year-old, who has different problems than a seventeen-year-old. What works to protect their mental health today is unlikely to work for very long as new challenges and new social circumstances place new pressures on them.\nThe pressure to keep up with meme culture is enormous. When I was in high school, coming into school on Monday without having seen that weekend\u2019s Saturday Night Live was a nightmare. You better have a good reason for why you missed it (listen, that was the mid-90s, one of SNL\u2019s heydays and nobody loves a Chris Farley sketch more than fifteen-year-olds) or you were simply left out of the conversations. Luckily, the conversation would likely die down in a day, and if a sketch became famous enough to be quoted forever, you\u2019d figure it out and catch up. Now imagine every hour of every day is like missing SNL. Teens are given so much content that they\u2019re trying to take a sip from a firehouse every single day. Memes build on each other and evolve at lightning speed and if you miss one part of it, you miss months of jokes and conversations. They cannot afford to unsubscribe from toxic content creators, in their eyes, because those content creators are the foundation of their \u201cwater cooler talk.\u201d\nA Double-Edged Sword\nBetween the phone being required as a communications device and the phone being the source of intense pressure from the social internet, kids don\u2019t see phones as a privilege or a reward, not in the way most parents think.\nParents think \u201cI paid for this thing, and I didn\u2019t have anything like then when I was a teen, therefore this thing is an expensive privilege that I am bequeathing to my child and that child better be grateful or else.\u201d But kids just don\u2019t see it that way. They may have asked for the phone, but they probably also asked for a pony and a vacation to Disney World every single summer, and you didn\u2019t give them either of those things, did you? So why did you give them the phone? Because you know it\u2019s not just a privilege, you recognize that there\u2019s more to it than that.\nYeah, your kids probably get upset when their phone is taken away or its usability is reduced, but you would be, too. Think about when the internet goes down in your house or at your office. It\u2019s a mixed bag of emotions, right?\nThe pressure is off, no one expects you to get work done on a day with no internet! This wouldn\u2019t apply to kids, though. If a parent revokes \u201cphone privileges\u201d and therefore denies a kid access to Google Classroom, homework still needs to get done. The pressure isn\u2019t off, it\u2019s been doubled.\nYou can\u2019t do any of the fun things you like to do on the internet! This applies to kids, too, except that so many of their IRL fun things have been rolled back or cancelled, either due to shifting priorities in our communities or the pandemic, so they often have nothing to do if they don\u2019t have the fun stuff in their phone.\nYikes, you didn\u2019t realize how often you mindlessly scroll, maybe this forced internet detox is a good thing! This applies to kids, too, though if the forced detox was presented in a toxic way, they\u2019re likely to kick against it, even if they would otherwise have secretly appreciated it.\nHow to Take Away Phone \u201cPrivileges\u201d in a Productive Way\nThere are a lot of wrong ways to handle \u201cphone privileges\u201d but there are a few key things you can do to help get your teen on board.\nBefore there\u2019s a problem, treat the phone like a tool. Yes, a kid\u2019s phone will have texting and games and fun apps, but it should also be well-stocked with practical applications. School apps, educational apps, apps that help them develop their hobbies and interests beyond just \u201cit\u2019s what my friends use\u201d. Teach them how to use the \u201cboring\u201d apps like measuring tools, budget trackers, reminders, lists (shared among the family for things like groceries and chores), the weather app, and calendars. Help them realize that you look at your phone a lot because your phone does a lot. A phone isn\u2019t just a toy, and they should learn to use the non-toy aspects of it, fluently and early.\nBefore there\u2019s a problem, analyze your kid\u2019s phone usage. From the beginning, use screentime tracking tools. Pay attention to how you use your phone and teach your kids to do the same. What app do you open most often after picking the phone up? Which app did you open forty-two times today? How much time are you spending on mindless scrolling (reddit, instagram, twitter, pinterest, tiktok) vs intentional conversations and action?\nWhen a problem arises, be analytical about it, not emotional. Rely on those screentime reports. If your kids are scrolling well past midnight when they have class at 7:00 AM, point out that this is what\u2019s causing them to oversleep and be tired and cranky all day. If their grades are slipping, talk about how much time homework would take compared to how much time they\u2019re spending on social media. Try to refrain from yelling, name-calling, or falling back on \u201cyou kids and those damn phones\u201d because, hello, pot, this is the kettle\u2026 you\u2019re looking awfully black over there.\nExplain clearly why you\u2019re taking away portions of the phone. \u201cYour grades are slipping, you\u2019ve been spending five hours a day on Discord. We need to eliminate this distraction so you can focus on homework. Once you get caught up, everything turned in for late credit, you can have Discord back.\u201d Or perhaps, \u201cYou\u2019ve been more disrespectful lately, and it seems like you\u2019re extra cranky when you\u2019re on social media. Let\u2019s have you take a short break, see if that improves your mood.\u201d If you, as the adult, can\u2019t make a reasonable connection between the problem behavior and the phone\u2026 then maybe the phone isn\u2019t the problem and you need to find a better, more helpful solution.\nTake away only the part that needs to be taken away. Our first effort is to enforce downtime from 10 PM to 6 AM, with only their white noise and Spotify available during that time. If that isn\u2019t enough to help them fix whatever is broken (grades, chores, other behavioral issues), then we reduce time on fun apps. Next, we eliminate time on fun apps altogether, making their device a texting machine with a calculator, flashlight, and weather report built in. One of our kids struggles with scrolling mindlessly, so social media is a no-no for him right now. One struggles with self-motivation, so he just needs time limits that shut down his fun apps so then he winds up doing his homework because there\u2019s nothing better to do. It probably doesn\u2019t need to be an all-or-nothing approach.\nCommunicate clearly what the expectations are to get it back. When you turn all your late assignments in. When we go five days without a shouting match in the house. When you finish an entire weekend of doing your chores without being asked to do them first. Depending on the behavioral issue, it might be a couple days or it might be weeks. I caution against lengthy punishments (months or an entire semester/season), because they\u2019re more demoralizing than anything and you\u2019re far more likely to walk it back, giving your kids every reason to doubt your word in the future.\nDon\u2019t link phone privileges to things that are outside a kid\u2019s control. A kid can control when they turn in all their late work, but not when the teacher grades it. A kid can control their own attitude, but not the way others treat them. A kid can control getting up on time for class, but not if the carpool driver shows up on time. Tie the phone to the kid\u2019s behavior, not to the outcomes that neither they nor you can control.\nAcknowledge your own reliance on technology and be sympathetic\nAre you more shouty when you\u2019re interrupted while scrolling TikTok? Did you spend four hours on YouTube today but the dishes didn\u2019t get done? Have you neglected IRL friends for the friends in your phone?\nRecognize that these behaviors may not be ideal, but are also not exactly tragic. You are human, you make mistakes, but you also deserve down time and relaxation.\nBut if you, the competent adult, can have bad phone days, then it\u2019s important to acknowledge that kids can have bad phone days too. If you\u2019re putting limits on your kid, consider putting them on yourself, too.\nMy husband can\u2019t go without a phone (we run a small business from home), but he deleted all social media and YouTube off his phone because he doesn\u2019t want to just waste time on those things (and for him, he did feel like it was wasted time, but he acknowledges that I have genuine fun on those apps sometimes).\nI\u2019ve gone through periods in my life where I put strict one-hour-per-day limits on my scrolling apps, and I recently moved my phone out of my bedroom overnight so I don\u2019t have the option of laying in bed and scrolling each morning.\nA phone is a tool. It isn\u2019t bad or good, it just \u2026 is.

What the Russian military is doing in Ukraine are barbaric war crimes committed by soulless savages. It is time to put an end to this.\nShoes of innocent Holocaust victims on exhibit at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C.\nThe shoes. What I will never forget are the shoes. The piles and piles of dusty old shoes are the visceral images seared in my mind from my initial military indoctrination. They smell like old clothes kept in your grandmother\u2019s attic for years. Up close, you can see that some are clearly from children, and others are from adult women and men. There are shoes of every size. These are clearly not military-issued uniform shoes. These are what remains of the genocide of millions of innocent civilians. As the poem on the wall reads, \u201cWe are the shoes, we are the last witnesses\u2026\u201d to one of the worst atrocities in human history.\nIn the summer of 1995, I was a plebe aspiring to become a U.S. Naval Officer. Our seasoned instructors took us on an unforgettable field trip to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C. We saw clearly the horrors of a war perpetrated by Nazi Germany without warrior ethics. It was meant to be prophylactic for us \u2014 a heavy dose of preventative medicine that would embolden us to keep something like this from ever happening again.\nIn a more dramatic version of this immersive experience, U.S. General Dwight D. Eisenhower (who later became President) made a point of personally going to see the Nazi concentration camps and war crimes with his own eyes. He wisely brought cameramen and reporters with him to interview survivors and document the atrocities. Upon his return, he famously wrote:\nI made the visit deliberately, in order to be in position to give first-hand evidence of these things if ever, in the future, there develops a tendency to charge these allegations merely to \u2018propaganda\u2019.\nIn our ethics and leadership studies at Annapolis, we engaged in frequent character development discussions to establish a true north for our moral compasses. We knew that one day we might face tough decisions under the stress and uncertainty of combat and still need to do the right thing, especially when it is the hardest decision to make. I remember distinctly studying the M\u1ef9 Lai massacre from the Vietnam War and the war crimes committed by U.S. Army Lieutenant William Calley and his soldiers. Calley was convicted of 22 counts of premeditated murder and ordered his men to destroy an entire village full of innocent people (estimated 300\u2013500 deaths), which included the gang rape and mutilation of several women and children before they were killed. This was a horrendous crime. A crime where no shred of a warrior code was followed. I was equally appalled when I learned President Nixon commuted Calley\u2019s sentence from life in prison to just three years in house arrest. This was dishonor piled on top of dishonor. The U.S. should still be ashamed of the M\u1ef9 Lai massacre\u2014 both the horrendous war crimes and the lack of consequences for those who committed them. It is a lesson we should never forget.\nThe U.S. has not had a spotless record on war crimes since the Vietnam War\u200a\u2014\u200afrom enemy prisoner torture to intentionally killing innocent civilians, we have committed some reprehensible acts. We have even had some recent Presidential pardons, against the advice of senior military leaders, of disgraced U.S. servicemen who admitted to committing war crimes. Former Marine Corps commandant, retired General Charles Krulak wrote that this leniency by our then Commander-In-Chief \u201crelinquishes the United States\u2019 moral high ground\u2026Disregard for the law undermines our national security by reducing combat effectiveness, increasing the risks to our troops, hindering cooperation with allies, alienating populations whose support the United States needs in the struggle against terrorism, and providing a propaganda tool for extremists who wish to do us harm.\u201d The U.S. should be in constant pursuit of the moral high ground, especially right now.\nThe overwhelming majority of our servicemen and women live by the code of the warrior and detest those who would dishonor us with their heinous acts. For example, on the first day of the war in Iraq in 2003, my team and I were responsible for 131 Iraqi prisoners of war. Some of them had surrendered to us and some of them we captured during a firefight. We fed them, gave them water to drink, provided medical attention to those who needed it, and we interrogated their senior officers which led to valuable intelligence. The only torture these men experienced was at the hands of their own regime. Many of them had the scars to prove it. We didn\u2019t even have enough zip ties to put them all in handcuffs. So, we had a Marine infantry squad set up a perimeter to guard them.\nSeveral days into the ground war, a news reporter flew in and asked to interview someone responsible for interrogating enemy prisoners of war. The battalion commander asked me to take the interview. This conversation bothered me so much that I wrote about it in an LA Times OpEd in 2006, Fire From the Home Front:\n\u201cDuring an interview with an American journalist, he charged that our military\u2019s supposed inhumane treatment of Iraqi prisoners had undercut any justification for the war. In response, I told him how I had personally protected hundreds of captured Iraqis who had been tortured under Hussein\u2019s regime and faced retaliation from insurgents. When I then showed him the copy of the Geneva Convention that I carried in my cargo pocket, he ended our conversation.\u201d\nWhile the U.S. has a far from perfect record when it comes to war crimes, we do have a long history of highly honorable service and sacrifice against the forces of evil. Most of our warriors do the right thing most of the time. Doing the right thing now means stopping the systematic Russian military massacre of innocent Ukrainian civilians. As Ukrainian troops recently retook the suburbs of Kiev, the evidence of Russian war crimes and genocide is widespread and apparent. Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said Sunday:\nThis is a special appeal aimed at drawing the world\u2019s attention to those war crimes, crimes against humanity, which were committed by Russian troops in Bucha, Irpin and Hostomel. These are liberated cities, a picture from horror movies, a post-apocalyptic picture. Victims of these war crimes have already been found, including raped women who they tried to burn, local government officials killed, children killed, elderly people killed, men killed, many of them with tied hands, traces of torture and shot in the back of the head. Robberies, attempts to take gold, valuables, carpets, washing machines. It, of course, will be taken into account by the Prosecutor\u2019s Office of Ukraine and law enforcement agencies and international criminal courts.\nRight now, as the whole world sees this, \u201cwe are the shoes, we are the last witnesses.\u201d According to the mayor of Bucha, they have uncovered a mass grave that has nearly 300 people in it and the streets are littered with civilians handcuffed and killed execution-style with a bullet to the back of the head. Like Eisenhower\u2019s prescient quote, the Russian government is claiming that the hard evidence of these atrocities is fake and Ukrainian propaganda. Tell that to the family of the pregnant woman who died outside of the maternity and children\u2019s hospital that was intentionally bombed in Mariupol. Tell that to the families of the estimated 300 civilians killed in the Donetsk Academic Regional Drama Theater that was marked \u201cchildren\u201d from above so it wouldn\u2019t be targeted. The Russians bombed it anyway. In my combat experience, I made several extremely tough decisions regarding what targets to engage and how to engage them. I was constantly thinking about taking the fight and overwhelming force to the enemy while minimizing, to the greatest extent possible, damage to civilians. This is the code of the warrior.\nPutin is no warrior. Putin has no honor code. Everyone continues to speculate about his end game. We know what Putin\u2019s end game is \u2014 he wants his legacy to be the reunification of the Russian Empire and he is willing to commit genocide to get it. Have no doubt that an agreement with Putin, just like the Budapest Memorandum, will be violated by him the day it is signed. What does a neutral Ukraine even mean? Ukraine stands for freedom and the fight against oppression. We need to urgently ask ourselves, what is the end game of the liberal democracies of the world? What do the U.S. and Europe want the history books to say about what we did or did not do in Ukraine \u2014 the new frontline of freedom? Imagine, after killing thousands of innocent people, Putin settles for some foothold territories in Ukraine. Then what? Do you believe he will stop there? No. Should Russia stay on the UN Security Council? No. The G20? No. Should we relax sanctions? No. Is there any peace in this world with Putin still in it? No. If history has taught us anything, the path of appeasement is paved with countless lost souls.

You should be angry too. There is an enemy that has been waging the deadliest war against our warriors and it has been winning. More than 4 times as many U.S. post-9/11 veterans have died by suicide than in the entire Global War on Terrorism, War in Iraq, and War in Afghanistan combined over 20 plus years. Let. That. Sink In. Suicide is our military\u2019s number one enemy, and we are not acting like it.\nSource: Brown University Costs of War Research.\nFrankly, as a society, I do not understand how we get so fired up about trivial non-life-threatening issues and fail to tackle the ones that are literally killing some of our best and most honorable citizens. Winning this fight starts with us collectively making a mindset shift \u2014 one that I have personally struggled to make and had to be reminded of recently by a fellow veteran.\nPeople do NOT commit suicide. They do NOT kill themselves. They die by suicide. When we place all of the responsibility on the person who is dead, it makes it way too easy for the living to not have to make any changes to how we behave. Death by suicide has many causes and contributing factors, but not a single one of them is \u201cthe person was just too weak\u201d or \u201cthe person was just too broken.\u201d Some of the strongest people I have had the honor of knowing and serving with have died by suicide and none of us are broken beyond repair. As one of my fellow veterans told me, \u201cWe are not broken, we are just bent.\u201d Once we all claim some responsibility for creating the current conditions, then, and only then, can we take the appropriate actions to improve the situation.\nNext, we need to recognize that the situation is really bad and getting worse and therefore the current actions are insufficient and ineffective. Like Narcotics Anonymous used to put on their pamphlets, \u201cThe definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result.\u201d Recently, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin announced that Congress has required the Pentagon to create an independent committee to review suicide prevention programs and improve them. The SecDef wrote, \u201cOne death by suicide is one too many. And suicide rates among our service members are still too high.\u201d While I applaud the independent review and the focus on this issue by the SecDef, simply saying our numbers are \u201cstill too high\u201d is misleading as it sounds like we might be making some progress. The reality is we have a crisis level suicide epidemic in our veteran community. The Department of Defense Suicide Prevention Office just released a report showing for the U.S. Army, \u201cthe rates of suicide deaths among soldiers in 2021 were at their highest since before World War II. The total number of suicide deaths was also the highest seen in 20 years.\u201d So, not only are the numbers still too high \u2014 they are the worst rates and absolute deaths we have seen in a very long time and they are rising.\nIs there a suicide problem in our society as a whole? Yes, absolutely. Are our servicemen and servicewomen more likely to die by suicide? Yes, absolutely. Veterans between the ages of 18 and 34 have 2.5 times the suicide rate of that of the adjusted general population. Before we blame the rise in veteran suicides all on 20+ years of combat related stress, trauma, and traumatic brain injuries, according to the VA\u2019s own suicide report, we should note non-combat veterans are nearly twice as likely to die by suicide and there is no clear correlation between combat and suicide. The DoD and the VA, for years, have been in denial about rising suicides in the U.S. military. According to the Brown University Cost of War research:\nThe DoD and others have maintained, apart from 2012, the suicide rates adjusted for age, sex, and population are almost the same between active duty service members and those of the general population. They can no longer argue this since the number of suicides and the rate have become worse in recent years as 2018, 2019, and 2020 [and now 2021] have consecutively marked the worst years of active service member suicide since the previous peak year in 2012. Rates of active component suicides decreased after the 2012 peak, but they have trended on an upward slope since the post-2012 valley. Those rates have now surpassed the 2012 rate and outpace the suicide rate of the public.\nWe are not doing enough for those who are serving, those who are transitioning out, and those who are still wrestling with the aftershocks and demons of their service. Suicide is a worse and more deadly enemy than any other threat our military faces. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Milley, recently responded to a question about behavioral health staff shortages in our military quipping that every unit has a \u201cbehavioral health specialist\u201d in their squad leader. While I get what the General was trying to say in terms of troops taking care of each other, the average servicemember is ill-equipped to provide the professional assessment, therapy, and treatments our troops desperately need. Saying squad leaders will fix the staffing shortages of behavioral health specialists is the combat equivalent of putting a band-aid on a sucking chest wound.\nPentagon bureau chief for @MilitaryTimes\nCongressional leaders are fed up with the DoD\u2019s and VA\u2019s inability to stem the rising tide of veteran suicides and are taking notice. Senator John Tester, Chairman of the Senate\u2019s Veterans\u2019 Affairs Committee, recently pushed DoD leaders on the issue of military suicide:\n\u201cI\u2019ve been here for 15 years. We\u2019ve been talking about mental health for 15 years on the VA Committee. These are folks that are coming out of the military and they\u2019re killing themselves\u2026Now I understand that it takes a while for government to do stuff and it\u2019s tough to get the ship turned around. But I will just say this: if mental health is a huge issue, and it is \u2014 most of you addressed it in your opening statement \u2014 why are we tolerating the mental health screening to take two years to get into the transition?\u201d\nWhat can you do to help? Three simple things:\nSpread the word, by sharing this article far and wide, that veteran suicides for post-9/11 veterans is more than 4 times more deadly than the wars we have fought in for the last 20+ years.\nCall and/or write your U.S. Senators and U.S. Congressperson for your district and ask them what they are doing to fix this growing problem.

When it is not, he takes his mind off his own meaningless affairs by minding other people\u2019s business.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aEric Hoffer, The True Believer\nAfter college, I used to teach a basic class on different forms of government to my fellow Navy Sailors and US Marines. Whether you agree with the concept or not, I found the horseshoe theory of politics to be quite instructive. The idea is that the different forms of government in practice are not on a linear spectrum, but on one where the far-right and far-left extremes actually bend toward each other like the ends of a horseshoe. At this convergence of the two heels is totalitarianism and ultimately autocracy \u2014 the centralization of absolute power in the hands of one person (and his cronies) and the subservience of everyone else to that dictator and his (it is almost always a male tyrant) state. At the toe or the curve in the horseshoe, the part farthest away from the extremes, is autonomy. What the far-left and the far-right fear the most is individual freedom for all. They hate it when \u201cyou do you.\u201d\nYou might say, \u201cwhy isn\u2019t the opposite of an autocracy a democracy?\u201d Well, even a well-meaning democracy can unwittingly (or wittingly) vote into office an authoritarian dictator who consolidates power and strips away the liberties of his own people to do it, typically wrapped in a thin veneer of patriotism and religion. Sadly, illiberal democracies, also known as electoral authoritarianism, are on the rise. Look at all the autocrats around the world and throughout history who have extended or violated their own term limits, weakened the non-executive branches of government, and tried to overturn free and fair elections to strengthen their own grip on power. \u201cPeople unfit for freedom \u2014 who cannot do much with it \u2014 are hungry for power.\u201d\nThere is nothing an autocrat fears more than a society of truly free individuals, especially if they are acutely aware of their own \u201ccertain unalienable Rights.\u201d While the autocrat publicly voices their own desire and fight for freedom, beware as what they are really talking about is their flavor of \u201cfreedom\u201d and only for people like them, not everyone. What we have to remember about a truly autonomous society is that you will most certainly be offended at some point by what your neighbors do, but so long as it does no real harm to you or others, you have to respect it if you want to be afforded the same freedom for you to do things they may not like. In other words, live and let live AND love and let love. As an example, I like to say, \u201cIt disgusts me that you would burn our American flag, but I risked my life for us all to live in an America where you are free to do it without reprisal.\u201d\nAs a political science major at the US Naval Academy, I was drawn to study courses on terrorism, low intensity conflict, revolutions, and failed states. I learned a lot about what forms of government work well and which ones don\u2019t based on the revolutionary changes people have demanded throughout history and which ones they have been willing to fight and even die for. What really intrigued me and still does is, \u201cwhy would anyone willingly give up their own freedoms and fight to spread the same oppression to others?\u201d The philosopher that I felt best answered this question was Eric Hoffer \u2014 famous for writing The True Believer and many other insightful works. Hoffer establishes what it is about a potential convert that compels him or her to join such a horrible and self-enslaving cause:\nUnless a man has talents to make something of himself, freedom is an irksome burden. Of what avail is freedom to choose if the self be ineffectual? We join a mass movement to escape individual responsibility, or, in the words of the ardent young Nazi, \u201cto be free from freedom.\u201d It was not sheer hypocrisy when the rank-and-file Nazis declared themselves not guilty of all the enormities they had committed. They considered themselves cheated and maligned when made to shoulder responsibility for obeying orders. Had they not joined the Nazi movement in order to be free from responsibility?\nHoffer goes deeper, exposing the roots of why anyone would join such an evil movement and choose to fight and die for it:\nPeople whose lives are barren and insecure seem to show a greater willingness to obey than people who are self-sufficient and self-confident. To the frustrated, freedom from responsibility is more attractive than freedom from restraint. They are eager to barter their independence for relief of the burdens of willing, deciding and being responsible for inevitable failure. They willingly abdicate the directing of their lives to those who want to plan, command and shoulder all responsibility.\nIn modern times, this is where Putin has stepped in to \u201cplan, command and shoulder all responsibility.\u201d He is giving us a horrifying example of a power-hungry dictator who is preying on the insecurities of his own people \u2014 people he has oppressed, terrorized, and robbed of their constitutional freedoms for more than two decades. In professor Alexander J. Motyl\u2019s recent Op-Ed in Politico titled Putin Isn\u2019t Just an Autocrat. He\u2019s Something Worse. He calls on us all to admit to and name the dark reality about Putin that we have been avoiding:\nAnalysts have usually shied away from asking just what type of regime has these specific characteristics, preferring to say that Putin\u2019s Russia is Putinist or merely authoritarian. But there is a word that many historians and political scientists use for an authoritarian state with a charismatic leader who promotes a personality cult. That word is fascism. Mussolini\u2019s Italy and Hitler\u2019s Germany fit the bill, but so does Stalin\u2019s Soviet Union and Kim\u2019s North Korea. Fascism, in other words, can be found on the political right or the political left. And, as most Ukrainians and many Russians agree, it\u2019s now the best word to describe Putin\u2019s Russia.\nPutin as Lord Voldemort by street artist Kawu in Wilda, Pozna\u0144, Poland.\nPutin is a Fascist. A war criminal. And is massively insecure. He is overly worried about his legacy and look at what it is going to end up being. He is forcing a genocide on the innocent, freedom-loving people of Ukraine. Putin is rich with money and power and poor in heart and spirit. Putin seeks more power because he cannot achieve much without it. Putin, like Hitler and Stalin before him, is afraid of having to live up to his own human potential. Putin cannot build himself up, so he tears down others to feel bigger and better than them. Putin, in the words of Hoffer, is a \u201chave not.\u201d\nThe desire for power is basically an attribute of a \u201chave-not\u201d type of self. If Hitler had had the talents and the temperament of a genuine artist, if Stalin had had the capacity to become a first-rate theoretician, if Napoleon had had the makings of a great poet or philosopher they would hardly have developed the all-consuming lust for absolute power. Freedom gives us a chance to realize our human and individual uniqueness. Absolute power can also bestow uniqueness: to have absolute power is to have the power to reduce all the people around us to puppets, robots, toys, or animals, and be the only man in sight. Absolute power achieves uniqueness by dehumanizing others.\nTo sum up: Those who lack the capacity to achieve much in an atmosphere of freedom will clamor for power.\nIn 2022, I believe most of us aspire to live \u201cin an atmosphere of freedom\u201d and wish that for all of our brothers and sisters around the globe. However, less than 20% of the world\u2019s population lives in a free country and freedom has been on the decline for the last 15 plus years, including here in the United States. Ukraine has become the frontline of freedom for the world and the stakes could not be any higher. The US, Europe, and all people who desire freedom and autonomy have a lot to lose if we allow Putin to win. We cannot stand idly by while one man tries to \u201chave the power to reduce all the people around us to puppets, robots, toys, or animals\u201d or even worse \u2014 murders and kidnaps them, which he is doing.\nThe question still remains:\nWill we do enough, fast enough to secure our freedom and the freedom of the world? #standwithukraine\n", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 7, "created_time": 1647545941127, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Putin", "Russia", "Ukraine", "War", "Freedom"]}, {"author": "Nate Boaz", "post_id": "e6540b96b6c4", "user_id": "2e708876c0b9", "title": "To Russia with Love", "content": "To Russia with Love\nA Russian citizen protests against the war in Ukraine, Trafalgar Square, London, UK.

[note: nuclear disarmament? yes! disarming the public, making us defenseless against tyranny? hell no!]\nThat is no vision of a distant millennium. It is a definite basis for a kind of world attainable in our own time and generation. That kind of world is the very antithesis of the so-called new order of tyranny which the dictators seek to create with the crash of a bomb.\nSadly, more than eighty years later, these freedoms are still not universal, and we now face \u201cthe so-called new order of tyranny which\u201d Putin seeks \u201cto create with the crash of a bomb.\u201d Imagine a Russia where you are not arrested and jailed for speaking out against this illegal invasion of Ukraine? In Russia, as you well know, you are not even permitted to call this war a war. Media outlets across Russia have stopped reporting on the war for fear of Putin\u2019s new laws to control and muzzle the press. Putin has blocked Facebook and Twitter \u2014 platforms that his bots and subversive agents used to propagate propaganda to fracture the free world and undermine our democratic elections. Now that the truth hurts and is working against Putin, he is calling the real news \u201cfake news.\u201d He signed in to law legislation which provides for a 15 year prison sentence if people are found to be \u201cfalsely\u201d reporting on the Russian military. In other words, anything \u2014 including the absolute truth \u2014 is a crime if it embarrasses Putin and makes him and his war look bad.\nYou deserve a safe, free, and prosperous Russia. One that is not controlled by corrupt oligarchs and Soviet-era intelligence officers who assassinate and imprison dissidents. One that has a diverse and abundant economy that is not solely dependent on exporting hydrocarbons to make the few wealthy while the many suffer. You deserve a Russia where you can love who you want to love. Believe what you want to believe. Say what you want to say. And do what you want to do as long as it does no harm to others. We recognize there are millions of good and peace-loving people in Russia who are under the thumb of a repressive regime. We see you. We hear you. We applaud your courage for standing up, speaking out, and for facing imprisonment or worse. We, the free world, need to do much more, faster.\nIn that same State of the Union address, President Roosevelt called upon the United States and all of our people (military and civilian) to make this pledge and we need to recommit to this today \u2014 for a free Ukraine, a future with a free Russia, and a free world:\nLet us say to the democracies: \u201cWe Americans are vitally concerned in your defense of freedom. We are putting forth our energies, our resources and our organizing powers to give you the strength to regain and maintain a free world. We shall send you, in ever-increasing numbers, ships, planes, tanks, guns. This is our purpose and our pledge.\u201d\nIn fulfillment of this purpose we will not be intimidated by the threats of dictators that they will regard as a breach of international law or as an act of war our aid to the democracies which dare to resist their aggression. Such aid is not an act of war, even if a dictator should unilaterally proclaim it so to be.\nWhen the dictators, if the dictators, are ready to make war upon us, they will not wait for an act of war on our part. They did not wait for Norway or Belgium or the Netherlands to commit an act of war.\nTheir only interest is in a new one-way international law, which lacks mutuality in its observance, and, therefore, becomes an instrument of oppression.\nThe happiness of future generations of Americans may well depend upon how effective and how immediate we can make our aid felt.\nThe happiness of future generations of liberty seeking people, all around the world, \u201cmay well depend upon how effective and how immediate we can make our aid felt.\u201d America needs to fulfill its role as the \u201cArsenal of Democracy.\u201d Let us all work together to do our part to fight and resist Putin\u2019s tyranny. Let us all work together to do our part to fight for \u201cLife, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\u201d Knowing \u201cthat to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, \u2014 That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.\u201d Putin\u2019s form of government is destructive and it is your right, as the governed, to alter or to abolish it. Here is to a future with a safe, free, and happy Russia and a safe, free, and happy Ukraine. Let\u2019s get to work.\nSincerely,\nThe U.S.A.", "comment_count": 1, "like_count": 5, "created_time": 1646787069945, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Ukraine", "Russia", "Putin", "Freedom", "War"]}, {"author": "Will Leitch", "post_id": "a3de8b993400", "user_id": "d8285308b7d7", "title": "Forget Generations X, Y and Z: Let\u2019s Label People by Presidents", "content": "Forget Generations X, Y and Z: Let\u2019s Label People by Presidents\nWhat President were you born under?\n\nIn the wake of the release of Chuck Klosterman\u2019s terrific book The Nineties, there has been an influx of discussion of Generation X, and how that generation differs from Generations Y, and Z, and Millennials, and Boomers, and whatever other names are floating around that I don\u2019t know about yet. But I do sometimes wonder if having such broad labels spanning decades of time is slicing the bread too thick. I wonder if, on this President\u2019s Day, we should think of this as a matter of Presidents.\nSpecifically: Who was President were you born? It\u2019s either a four-or-eight-year stretch, and it gives us much clearer, more specific spans of time to deal with. I think you can tell much more about a person by which President\u2019s term they were born under than what \u201cgeneration\u201d they are. Let\u2019s give it a try.\nBiden Babies (Born January 2021-present). These people are literal babies. They have existed only in a pandemic. They\u2019re still shitting in their pants. It\u2019s probably fair to say we don\u2019t know much about these kids yet, except that someday their parents will tell their grandchildren how freaking crazy it was to have a baby in a pandemic.\nTrump Babies (Born January 2017-January 2021). The oldest of these kids is still only five years old, so we don\u2019t know a lot about them yet either. Though we do know a lot of them spent kindergarten staring at a computer screen. Also: When future generations look back at this period and think, \u201cwait, that guy was President?\u201d the kids born during this time will be like, \u201cyeah, and I was born during that time! I can\u2019t believe I survived.\u201d I can\u2019t believe any of us did, kid.\nObama Babies (Born January 2009-January 2017). This group, which includes both my 10-year-old son and my seven-year-old son, just minted its first teenagers. I know that 2009 is only 13 years ago, but considering the seismic changes our culture and our technology have gone through in that time, they might as well have been born in the 1920s. I do suspect this is the generation, out of all of these, that is, in 50 years, most proud of the President they were born under.\nDubya Babies (Born January 2001-January 2009). These are now legal adults and, come this month, some of them (unlike Dubya) will be legally drinking. This is of course the September 11 generation, people who only know life during the 20-year panic attack our country has been having since the Towers fell. If any of these kids were to read The Nineties, it would feel essentially like reading about the Civil War.\nClinton Babies (Born January 1993-January 2001). Check it out, millennials: You\u2019re all about to turn 30. Suck on that. Have you noticed how you\u2019re drifting out of the target demo now? Welcome to our world. If you were born in the first term of the Clinton administration, you are now old enough to run for the House of Representatives. Madison Cawthorne, born in 1995, actually is in the House, though only officially.\nGeorge H.W. Babies (Born January 1989-January 1993). These are the last people to live in the wake of the cold war, and also the ones who never saw Phil Hartman on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d They all were the first ones to have email addresses in high school, which is to say, they might be the last kids to remember life before them.\nReagan Babies (Born January 1981-January 1989). If you were in the second or third grade and had to do drills where you got under your desk because someone had launched a nuclear weapon, you might be a Reagan baby. Also, you people are all about to turn 40, which is to say everyone is about to stop caring what you think too.\nCarter Babies (Born January 1977-January 1981). This is right on the Generation X/Y border, though, again, they\u2019re all over 40 now, so there\u2019s no real important distinction to be made. These people all started college without email and they have no idea how to use Tik-Tok, though they\u2019re probably still trying.\nFord Babies (Born August 1974-January 1977). This is a shorter-term, and it\u2019s tough to find as many people who happened to cross over into the Ford administration. I am one of them, though, born October 1975. Basically, we\u2019re the ones born under a President that no one under 30 quite realizes was ever President.\nNixon Babies (Born January 1969-August 1974). These are the kids of hippies and Boomers, the ones whose parents were surely losing their minds about bringing kids into this world at the tumultuous time they did. Which is to say: They\u2019re a lot like parents right now.\nLBJ Babies (Born November 1963-January 1969). The first of these cohorts will be turning 60 next year, which makes them, really, too young to be boomers and too old to be Generation X. That\u2019s to say, they\u2019re much more likely to be into Bruce Springsteen than the Eagles. But still likely into both. For what it\u2019s worth, Kamala Harris is an LBJ Baby.\nJFK Babies (Born January 1961-November 1963). If these babies\u2019 parents are still alive, and they could be, they are all long, long tired overhearing how they were sitting in their crib when their parents saw on television that JFK had been shot. \u201cYes, yes, mom, you were watching \u2018As the World Turns,\u2019 I heard all about it.\u201d\nEisenhower Babies (Born January 1953-January 1961). These are still sort of young boomers: The oldest of this group was probably still too young to go to Woodstock. Think Kevin Arnold from \u201cThe Wonder Years.\u201d\nTruman Babies (Born April 1945-January 1953). Now here are your classic boomers: You\u2019ll see lots of these at car shows, or walking through abandoned malls for exercise. Both of my parents, still alive and healthy, are Truman Babies. Lots of Truman babies had Nixon babies. (Donald Trump is a Truman baby, though only barely.)\nFDR Babies (Born March 1933-April 1945). The oldest of this group will be reaching their 90s next year. Twelve years is a truly remarkably long time to be President. Joe Biden is an FDR baby, as is Nancy Pelosi.\nHoover Babies (Born March 1929-March 1933). These were babies born during the Depression, which isn\u2019t going to seem that different to future generations to babies that were born during the pandemic.\nCoolidge Babies (Born March 1923-March 1929). Now we\u2019re getting into the deep cuts. If you\u2019re a Coolidge Baby, you are at least 92 years old and perhaps as old as 98. Put it this way: Clint Eastwood is a year too young to be a Coolidge baby.\nHarding Babies (Born March 1921-March 1923). If you\u2019re turning 100 this year, congratulations: You\u2019re a Harding Baby.\nWilson Babies (Born March 1913-March 1921). Woodrow Wilson was President for the full eight years, which gets almost all (but not entirely all) of our living people over the age of 100. But \u2026\nTaft Babies (Born March 1909-March 1913). The oldest living American, Bessie Hendricks, is still older than a Taft Baby. She looks at Taft Babies and can\u2019t believe the sort of music these kids are listening to these days.\nTeddy Babies (Born March 1901-March 1909). There\u2019s Bessie: She was born two years before Teddy Roosevelt left office. She was in her 20s during the Depression. The oldest person on Earth is Japanese woman Kane Tanaka, who turned 119 last month. She\u2019s a Teddy Baby too.\nMcKinley Babies (Born March 1897-March 1901). If you were a McKinley Baby \u2014 like my great-grandmother, whose house I used to sleep over at when I was a kid \u2014 you are, I\u2019m sorry to say, dead. Better luck next time.\nWill Leitch writes multiple pieces a week for Medium. Make sure to follow him right here.

So we continue an occasional series \u2014 to be prescribed solely as directed \u2014 called From the Archives, which republishes old Will Leitch columns when they are relevant to the news of the day. This is a column I wrote for Deadspin back in December 2017 \u2014 and all writers who ever wrote for Deadspin before it died in November 2019 are heretofore encouraged to grab everything they can from it before it is wiped \u2014 about how we\u2019d been conditioned to forget about nuclear war, even though it\u2019s just as terrifying and feasible as it has ever been. The focus of this at the time was Trump and North Korea, but the overarching premise is just as relevant today.\nIt is, as it goes, a day like any other. A family of five rustles around the breakfast table, in a hurry, shoveling food while rushing to get to school, to the office, to the carpool lane. They live in the city of Hamelin, a fictional suburb roughly 90 miles from San Francisco, where the father in the family works. He kisses the kids, flirts and bickers with his wife and sprints out the door with a smiling wave. The five-year-old son spills milk across the table; the two older kids fight over the television. Carol, the mom, hustles the kids off to school, where she directs the student play \u2014 it\u2019s about The Pied Piper this year. (The little mice are very cute.) Grandma and Grandpa are coming to visit from Chicago next Easter. The oldest son is getting better at riding his bike, even uphill. The neighbors down the road have a new baby. There\u2019s a lot going on, because there is always a lot going on. The Wetherly family in the 1983 film Testament is like every other family, every other person, every regular schmuck just walking around. Their lives are unremarkable and ordinary. They are just trying to go about their day, like anybody else.\nLater that night, Dad is stuck at the San Francisco office, so the family prepares dinner while the younger kids watch cartoons and squabble. The signal on the television starts to flicker and go grey; the oldest sister frowns and pounds it with her fist. Suddenly, a news anchor appears on the screen. \u201cThis is San Francisco,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have lost our New York signal. Radar sources confirm the explosion of nuclear devices there, in New York, and up and down the East Coast. Ladies and gentlemen, this is real.\u201d The phone rings. It\u2019s Dad, but only for a second \u2014 there is a blinding flash outside the home, followed by air sirens. The line goes dead. The television shuts off. The five-year-old screams \u201cMom!\u201d The family huddles behind the barcalounger, unsure where else to go. They just put their arms over their heads and hide.\nThe rest of Testament, the most brutal, pitiless, uncompromising movie I have ever seen, consists of everyone gradually dying off. Bombs have landed in every major American city, including San Francisco, and there is no power and no communication with the outside world. At first, the community comes together; there is some looting, but mostly Hamelin pools its resources and tries to help out the most immediately needy. (The Weatherly family takes in a neighbor child whose parents just never came home from San Francisco after he had spent several nights alone waiting for them.) Life attempts to go on in the usual habits, through the usual institutions. School begins again, piano lessons continue, church is still every Sunday morning. The kids\u2019 play goes on, but the parents cannot pretend: They weep throughout as the children look on, puzzled, a little scared. But where else are you going to go? What else can you do but go on?\nThen life starts to slowly fade away. Ham radios stop being able to pick up signals from outside the city. No one from San Francisco makes it home. And then the babies start getting sick. Then the elderly. The youngest son (played by a six-year-old Lukas Haas) gets out of a bath that he has filled with blood; the next scene is Carol tearing the house apart to find his beloved stuffed bear as his body is wrapped in a sheet outside their home, next to makeshift grave in the front yard. (The graveyards are all full.) Carol\u2019s hair is beginning to fall out in clumps. Her daughter, just entering her teenage years, asks her, coughing and frail, what being in love is like, and what \u201cmaking love\u201d means. Her answer stops the film.\nI was so ignorant as a girl. Worried about it. So full of fantasy. I thought some man would come along and sweep me off my feet. And your father, he wasn\u2019t at all what I was looking for. Not the size or shape, or what he did exactly, I still don\u2019t know. When you love someone, you want to be as close to them as you can get. You make love, and you feel almost like the same body. You have a space, and that person fills it up. We would fight. We wouldn\u2019t listen to each other. We\u2019d miss\u2026thoughts. We\u2019d miss goodbyes. But sometimes, most times, there was this feeling, and I couldn\u2019t wait for him to be here with me. Everyone\u2019s always alone. And yet \u2026 there can be this gift. This making of miracles.\nShe smiles sadly for the love she has lost, and her eyes meet her daughter\u2019s, who looks not moved, but angry. \u201cFor you, Mom,\u201d she says. \u201cBut not for me.\u201d In the next scene, Carol is sewing together a burial shroud for her. There is no wood left for coffins.\n\nNot once is there a hint of rescue, or escape, or even hope. There is no resolution but the end of the world.\nIn the film\u2019s final scene, the town is empty except for Carol, her oldest son and a neighbor boy with Down\u2019s Syndrome they\u2019ve brought into their home. They have made a decision. Carol closes the door to her garage. They sit in the car. She starts the engine. After a minute, she turns to her son.\n\u201cI can\u2019t do it,\u201d she says, and there is the failure of everyone in her voice. But there are no tears. There are none left. They go inside and light a candle on a graham cracker for birthdays that will never come. The neighbor boy has a present. He has found the lost teddy bear. Carol\u2019s heart breaks. \u201cYou found it,\u201d she says and smiles for the first time in the film. This is Testament\u2019s happy ending. This is all it has left to give to you.\n*************\nTestament hit theaters in 1983, two weeks before The Day After aired on ABC and terrified the poor Jennings family in The Americans. This was the height of Cold War nuclear paranoia, when President Reagan and various post-Brezhnev Russian leaders made the possible annihilation of the species the lead on every night\u2019s newscast and of day\u2019s every newspaper. This was a time in which any building that had a concrete basement put up FALLOUT SHELTER signs for the public to see, lest they need to locate one immediately. My grade school had them at the front and back entrances. The teachers used to smoke out there with some of the sixth graders, if memory serves. The signs were everywhere you wanted to look.\n\nThere was reason for this to be a daily part of everyone\u2019s lives. Since U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara had instituted American policy of Mutually Assured Destruction in the early \u201860s \u2014 the idea that the only way to combat a potential nuclear strike from the enemy (the USSR) was to stockpile enough weapons to let them know that if they attacked us, we\u2019d have no choice but to blow up them, and thus the world, in response \u2014 the idea that human life could, theoretically, end any minute was not just a reality, but in fact an official American international strategic initiative. It was just a part of your life, and, inevitably, part of your popular culture, whether it was Rocky Balboa trying to persuade an audience of Russians that if I can change and you can change then everybody can change, or the truly insane 1988 love story Miracle Mile, which ends with Anthony Edwards and Mare Winningham ending their first date by sinking into the La Brea Tar Pits while the bombs rain down all among them.\n\nOnce the Soviet Union fell and the Cold War ended, roughly six years after the release of Testament, the idea of mutually assured destruction almost immediately evaporated from public consciousness as anything other than a joke. It was a collective bullet dodged. The Cold War was over. The USSR had dissolved. There was no logical enemy remaining for the United States. There was no one to shoot a nuke at anymore; why would they shoot a nuke at us? The idea of a mushroom cloud became almost a figment of fun, a silly relic of a time when we were actually scared something like that could happen, a \u201cNow That\u2019s What I Call \u201880s!\u201d time capsule along with Max Headroom, Atari 2600s and Choose-Your-Own-Adventure paperbacks.\nYou could still be affected by a movie like Testament \u2014 or The Day After or even Dr. Strangelove \u2014 but you couldn\u2019t help but distance yourself from it. I saw Testament about 10 years ago, and while it was still powerful, it couldn\u2019t help but feel a little overheated. It was serious and sober-minded and even terrifying, but it also played like a reaction to a threat that never came. Watching it felt like reading an article that warned you about the dangers of the Y2K virus, or, more to the point, watching one of those old newsreel nuclear propaganda films from the \u201850s.\n\nFor a long time, there was a remove when you looked at this era. It was all a bit funny, really, how worried we were back then. There was nothing to be worried about it. Everything was fine. Bullet dodged. You felt smug relief in the distance. You knew something those filmmakers didn\u2019t. You know how this turned out.\nI will tell you: It is a very different experience to watch Testament right now, in December 2017, with Donald Trump as President and every little failsafe eroding a little bit more every day. It is a lot fucking different.\n**************\nThat so many earth-shattering \u2014 literally! \u2014 events are happening on a daily basis that no person could possibly keep up with all of them has become such a commonplace observation that merely stating it makes you sound old. A guy shoots 600 people from his Vegas hotel room, only the deadliest mass shooting in American history, and three months later not only have we all moved on from it, we don\u2019t even know (or seem to care anymore) why he did it. We appear to have definitive proof that there are aliens and that they have technology that the United States is \u201cincapable of defending itself\u201d against, and I haven\u2019t heard a single person in my life bring this up in conversation in even a passing fashion. It is a tumultuous time. How could it not be? The entire corporate world \u2014 which is to say, the entire world \u2014 is being rocked daily by stories of predatory, horrific men who have been abusing their leadership positions for decades. The leader of the free world is a unrepentant, almost cheerful racist who seems to have trouble keeping his hands from shaking and saying basic words. The earth itself is the early stages of actively trying to get rid of us. There\u2019s a lot to keep up with. Giancarlo Stanton is on the Yankees now. No reasonable person could possibly keep track of it all, even if they wanted to.\nBut, with all proper respect to these massive, important stories that are changing the foundation of the world we all live in \u2026 I sort of can\u2019t help but think that maybe we\u2019re not paying quite enough attention to the increasingly real possibility that we all going to die in a nuclear holocaust very soon. Maybe not quite enough?\nHere are four undeniable facts from this specific moment in history:\nThe President of the United States, a man whose father suffered from Alzheimer\u2019s disease and whose public speaking ability has degraded so dramatically over the last 20 years that watching him say stupid things in 1999 actually makes you nostalgic for that guy, told his top security officials that he wanted \u201ctens of thousands of new nuclear weapons,\u201d which inspired his Chief of Staff to call him a \u201cmoron.\u201d\nThe President of the United States has more power at this moment than at essentially any other time in American history and, if he wanted, could launch a nuclear attack entirely on his own and no one could stop him. \u201cIf President Trump were to decide that it\u2019s time to put Kim Jong Un in his place once and for all, he would choose a plan that already exists,\u201d a \u201cformer nuclear missile launch officer\u201d told USA Today. \u201cAnd it would be almost impossible in my view to override a decision to implement that option.\u201d\nFellow lawmakers and high-level cabinet members are so concerned about Trump\u2019s instability they have been actively trying to come up with some sort of Fail/Safe backup plan to Trump launching nuclear weapons, and their attempts have been thwarted at every turn. A sitting United States Senator actually said, on record, \u201cWe are concerned that the president of the United States is so unstable, is so volatile, has a decision-making process that is so quixotic that he might order a nuclear weapons strike.\u201d (This insane, flabbergasting statement was made just more than a month ago, so you\u2019ve surely forgotten about it.)\nNorth Korea, the foreign government most likely to pique the President\u2019s nuclear launch trigger finger, successfully pulled off a test less than a month ago that showed they could hit a U.S. mainline target with little difficulty. Secretary of Defense James Mattis responded to the news warning that North Korea could now strike anywhere in the world. The President responded by calling the leader of North Korea short and fat.\nDuring the Cold War, leaders of wealthy, stable, established nations were hinting at nuclear standoffs, and talking about missile defense systems, and testing thermonuclear weapons, and it led to three decades of apocalyptic popular fiction, fallout shelters being installed all across the country and schoolchildren being taught how to shield themselves from debris and radiation in case of a nuclear attack. It was the central organizing principle of most of the second half of the 20th century. It, singularly, affected every aspect of American life.\nAnd there were so many more protections then than there are now. Now there are non-state actors who would give any amount of money or human capital to get a hold of a nuclear weapon, of which, from the old Soviet Union, there are thousands of unaccounted for. There is an escalating threat from a desperate nation led by a madman whose only reference point for American life is Dennis Rodman. And there is the doddering cable news addict in the Oval Office who only seems to understand what Brian Kilmeade tells him. And remember: This is Brian Kilmeade.\n\nIt is difficult to concentrate on this because, well, Christ, look around. But once you start thinking about it, it\u2019s kind of impossible to stop. I am concerned about everything that has been happening on this planet, and the systematic injustice, and the inherent cruelty, and the growing sense that the world is getting a little bit worse every single day. Everything can seem like it is coming apart at the seams. But I hope you will forgive me when I try to aim the focus a little bit on the larger, more existential threat that seems higher than ever. You might think I am being overly dramatic or alarmist about this. You may be right. I very much hope you are right! But, again: Look around.\nThe Doomsday Clock, instituted in 1947 in direct response to the nuclear age, stood at 17 minutes to midnight in 1991. Days after President Trump\u2019s inauguration, they moved it to 2 1/2 minutes to midnight, and you got the sense from the announcement that they only made it 2 1/2 because it has never been closer than two minutes to midnight, and they wanted to be hopeful. There are thousands of problems in this world that need to be solved. But we are not going to be able to solve them if we are all dead. We can look back at the Cold War and think that maybe they were a little bit too scared back then. After all: No nuclear bombs went off! But I think that they were right, and we were wrong; I think we simply got bored and distracted and we forgot. I think that we are not scared enough.\n****************\nI was eight years old when Testament hit cinemas, just a little bit older than Lukas Haas in the film. I didn\u2019t see it in the theater: It wasn\u2019t until a decade later, on Roger Ebert\u2019s recommendation, that I finally watched it. I wouldn\u2019t have been able to understand it when I was eight. I would just been upset E.T wasn\u2019t in it. But I wonder if my parents watched it.\nUntil I watched it last week, for the first time in many years, I couldn\u2019t have fathomed how my parents \u2014 who had an eight-year-old son and a three-year-old daughter, two people whom they loved very much and wanted to see grow up and become adult humans with lives and children of their own \u2014 could have handled it. These children they loved so much, they ones they protected with an almost feral passion, how could they not think about them when they watched the Wetherly family wilt away and die? When my mother watched Carol\u2019s increased panic when she looked for that bear, did she look at me, still with my favorite blanket, and wonder if she\u2019d someday have to bury it with me? How did my dad feel when he went away on work trips, after watching this movie when one day, randomly, out of nowhere, the world exploded and he wasn\u2019t there with his family? To live in that time and feel like it all going away was a real, vivid possibility \u2026 how did they bear it?\nI\u2019m legitimately asking. Because unlike every other time I had watched Testament, I am a father now, of two beautiful little boys who are obnoxious and gassy and loud and just about the most incredible things I\u2019ve ever seen in my life. Every day my wife and I look at them and see the boys they are becoming, the men they will someday be, and we are thrilled, we are elated, we are driven near to tears to see them growing up, to learn more every day what they have to offer this planet. I find myself envious of everyone who hasn\u2019t met them yet. You are going to love them, world. I think of what they might be, what they might do, the mistakes they are going to make, the times they get their hearts broken, the hearts they break, the goodness that radiates off them, and I think that maybe they might be the only worthwhile thing I\u2019ve done with my whole stupid life. I can\u2019t wait to see who they become.\nBut Testament warns: Don\u2019t assume the future. It can all be taken away, forever, from everybody. Just because it hasn\u2019t happened before doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t happen now. That it hasn\u2019t happened before actually makes it more likely it will happen now. It is a threat, to you, to me, to everybody you love, to everybody I love. There are so many threats, so much danger in the world. But this is the biggest one. It makes you want to run through the streets screaming. It makes you wonder why not everyone is.\nToward the end of Testament, the school puts on the Pied Piper play. The bombs have fallen. People have already started dying. There is no word from the outside. There are no longer any illusions as to what is happening. But the play goes on anyway. What else can you do? The youngest son comes out, as the Pied Piper, and gives his closing speech as the Piper. \u201cYour children are not gone,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are just waiting for a world that deserves them.\u201d Every parent in the audience sobs. They know what world they\u2019ve given their children, and what it means for all of them. The question is: Do we?\nWill Leitch writes multiple pieces a week for Medium.

Let\u2019s not get cocky.\n\nSunday afternoon, New York City mayor Eric Adams, on his 100th day in office, announced that he had tested positive for Covid-19. He had woken up with a \u201craspy voice,\u201d took a rapid test that came back negative before taking a PCR test that returned positive. While having Covid-19 is certainly worse than not having Covid-19, Adams will surely be fine. He\u2019s fully vaccinated, he\u2019s a healthy 61 years old, he\u2019s already taking anti-viral medication. You wish him well.\nBut you also can\u2019t help but cluck your tongue a little. After all, just last week, on Wednesday, Adams boasted to reporters how he never got Covid-19, which is very much spiking the ball before you\u2019ve reached the end zone. The quote is an all-timer:\n\u201cI\u2019ve never had a positive diagnosis,\u201d Mr. Adams said. \u201cI\u2019ve felt good and I haven\u2019t felt the symptoms, and I am around people all the time \u2014 even in the heart of Covid. I was at ground zero. For whatever reason, I think it\u2019s a combination of my eating lifestyle, and some luck maybe involved but no, I never had it.\u201d\nHe tested positive four days later.\nThere is an old joke about a man who believes that death is an urban legend: After all, it has never happened to him. When you\u2019ve spent every day of the last two-plus years thinking about a virus that you, for whatever reason, have not caught yourself, you can\u2019t help but feeling a little immune: It got most of the planet, but it never got you.\n\nI understand this sensation because I also have never gotten Covid-19. It has gotten close to me. My wife and my youngest son, back over Christmas 2020 \u2014 that super-scary surge \u2014both had it, and I was in close proximity to both of them; both of them slept right next to me, blasting their Covid air straight into my face, before we knew they had it. But I came out scot-free. I never tested positive, never had any symptoms, never have shown any evidence of having contracted it in antibody tests. Depending on which estimate you read, somewhere between 40 percent and 65 percent of Americans have had Covid-19 at some point, including two of the last three Presidents. I\u2019ve somehow escaped it.\nWill I get it at some point? I\u2019ll confess, like most Americans, my avoidance tactics have waned dramatically from where they were two years ago. I still wear masks wherever I\u2019m supposed to, and I\u2019ve fully vaccinated and boosted and will get the next shot whenever they tell me I\u2019m supposed to get my next shot. (I\u2019m currently five months out from my last one, and 46 years old, so not yet.) But on the whole: I\u2019m back to normal. I eat indoors, I go to sporting events, I was at a big indoors celebration just this weekend. This obviously increases the possibility that I will get Covid-19. But I also have done everything I can do: Gotten my shots, made sure my loved ones have gotten theirs, told everyone I can about the safety and efficacy of the vaccines. I also believe \u2014 like the vast, vast majority of Americans, and humans \u2014 that eventually you have to, you know, live. I\u2019m cautious. But I\u2019m also eager to get back to living.\nI\u2019m fortunate: I have no preexisting condition, am not immuno-compromised and have no close family members who are either. I don\u2019t want to get Covid-19, but if I do get it, I am confident I will be fine, as will the people around me. That\u2019s my risk calculus; yours might be different.\nBut the one thing I will not do is act like I\u2019ve done anything special not to get it already \u2014 I\u2019m not pulling an Eric Adams. I do not know why I haven\u2019t gotten Covid-19 yet, especially considering I was in the same house with two people who had it, before there were ever vaccines available. I am not special, just like Eric Adams is not special. It\u2019s just a forever-game of roulette. I\u2019ll take appropriate precautions, and if the Covid dodgeball hits me, I\u2019ll isolate and do what I\u2019m supposed to do. But I won\u2019t get cocky. I\u2019m lucky, and I will not act like it is anything more than that. Eric Adams put a big target on his face and dared Covid to hit him. I will make no such mistake.\nWill Leitch writes multiple pieces a week for Medium. Make sure to follow him right here.

But when you study art history, as I did, some degree of familiarity with religious traditions is unavoidable. No matter my attachment to my skepticism of organized religion, I couldn\u2019t, and still can\u2019t, help but find myself in awe of Catholic art. I wasn\u2019t so shocked that I was drawn to the delicious opulence of many Catholic works of art, but I was surprised by how I found myself drawn to the ritual and devotion expressed in many of the works, especially those created by nuns.\nA section of the 21 foot painting- Smithsonian Magazine\nAt the apex of my outsider curiosity with Catholic art and my love of food and cooking sits the oft-rendered and much-adored Last Supper. It was serendipitous that while I was interning at the Peggy Guggenheim Collection in Venice, the recently unearthed and restored Last Supper painted by Renaissance-era nun Plautilla Nelli would go on view at the Santa Maria Novella Monastery in Florence. As the work was the first of its kind painted by a woman artist (that we know of), I knew I had to make a pilgrimage to see it.\nI was drawn to this work of art not just because of the exceptional circumstances of its artist, but because of the way she approached the subject matter. Nelli chose to depict Jesus and his disciples feasting upon foods that would have been typical of a 16th-century Tuscan diet, foods that she and her sisters would have eaten in the refectory of their convent, Santa Caterina, where the painting originally hung: whole roasted lamb, heads of lettuce, and fava beans. The elaborate tableware, atypical for last supper paintings, suggests a reverence for the food as well as for Jesus himself.\nNuns lead a life ruled entirely by rituals. Nelli and her sisters almost certainly ate at the same times each day, prayed before each meal, and looked upon the masterful painting by Nelli as they did so, placing the act of eating within a greater religious context. We may often think of nuns\u2019 devotional lifestyle as dull or deprived, but so much of it must have been sumptuous. As they ate they gazed upon a magnificent work of art, which featured foods they themselves ate, that we know they must have been fond of, as Nelli chose to depict Jesus himself indulging in them at the most important feast in Catholic history. The Bible states that we are made in God\u2019s image, but in Plautilla Nelli\u2019s last supper, God is made in the image of her and her sisters, which she expresses powerfully through food.\nNow, I think of Nelli and her sisters whenever I shell fava beans with my partner, a repetitive task that feels like a ritual in itself. And I think of her, too, when I buy lush heads of lettuce from my favorite farm at the market every Wednesday, a ritual of my own. And when I eat, I glance at the painting commissioned by my partner from a friend of ours that depicts the very first meal we made in our house together.\nWhen food and love come together \u2014 like the love we feel for those who sit around our table, or the love put into preparing a meal \u2014 we often feel compelled to venerate it: a snapshot, an Instagram story, a still life painting. Nelli\u2019s painting shares that same impulse. In her Last Supper, Nelli celebrated the love between Jesus and his Apostles by mirroring the love surely felt by the sisters of Santa Caterina, sharing their monastic life. While many of the Last Supper paintings I\u2019ve seen in museums and churches across Europe have inspired awe, Nelli\u2019s provides a more simple reminder: that food can bring us closer to those we love. Every supper is then, in a way, a Last Supper \u2014 knowing that no matter how many times we repeat the ritual, we\u2019ll never eat that exact same food again or feel that exact same love. Maybe that\u2019s why all of us \u2014 me and you, Plautilla Nelli, even Jesus himself \u2014 have an urge to venerate and remember our most meaningful meals.\nElise\u2019s piece was originally published in Issue 5 of Potluck.

Miss the frantic search for a bar, club night, and then later the inevitable wait in the freezing cold at 3am for a taxi, and stay indoors all cosy, just the two of us, and gorge on a four course meal. Those party funds could now be spent on all of our favourite things; we had baked Camembert with redcurrant jelly, root vegetable gratin, a ham boiled in cola, roast potatoes, pudding, a cheese board, champagne and whisky cocktails. It felt liberating to throw off the shackles of New Year expectations of crowds and parties to simply feast, without a care for calorie content.\nWhile it would be indulgent to suggest that in an age of austerity and food banks the decision of a middle class woman to gorge herself on Brie is somehow a feminist act of resistance, feasting is rarely associated with adult women in a positive way. Even if we are seeing more representation of bigger bodies, the cultural ideal is still for women to take up less space and the diet industry \u2014 with its emphasis on supposed healthy foods over pleasure \u2014 still takes in millions of pounds of women\u2019s cash each year. In this context, is a woman listening to her appetite, and indulging it, some small victory? Women\u2019s appetites \u2014 whether it be for food, sex, power or money \u2014 have always been policed and used to shame us, powerful as they are.\nWhen I came of age in the early noughties, feasts were the preserve of little girls and stories \u2014 think Famous Five, Willy Wonka and Alice\u2019s Mad Hatter tea party \u2014 while women were meant to have a more complicated, even tormented, relationship with food. As I grew, so did an awareness that you shouldn\u2019t eat too much of certain foods, picked up in overheard discussions of loss and gain and diets and calories. Figures needed to be \u2018watched\u2019 in order to be acceptable.\nOften, women I would see on the telly didn\u2019t really seem to eat proper food or enjoy food together. After a hard days work, tiny Ally McBeal would head home and sink a spoon into a tub of luxury ice cream while moaning to long-suffering flatmate Renee. Why did they never stir a jar of pesto through a big pan of tagliatelle, sprinkle liberally with cheese, and sit down with a shared bottle of red from the corner shop?\nBridget Jones associated food with guilt and always turned to chocolate or pizza when heartbroken, then regretted it after. In Sex and the City, even though the women met each week at a caf\u00e9 for brunch, the food itself never got much enthusiasm, always second to the men being verbally dissected. At this time, women were often portrayed as career focused, which apparently meant no time for cooking, or even eating. In celebrating women who had thrown off the shackles of domestic servitude, the enjoyment of eating was lost. In Friends, one of the main characters is even a chef, but is rarely witnessed talking about food let alone eating it.\nWithin this context, it is easy to see why Nigella Lawson was such a sensation when her first TV series was first aired around the millennium. Food, and in particular listening to your own appetite and cooking accordingly, was celebrated. Dishes were discussed in terms of their taste and comforting properties instead of whether they were fattening. There were recipes for feasts to share with friends and family, but also recipes for solo feasts, indulgent dishes to be savoured alone. Nigella\u2019s books often include recipes which serve one, such as her simple but decadent clam linguine, which has just a handful of basic ingredients and is ready in 15 minutes. Feasting solo \u2014 eating whatever you fancy, without thinking about others or worrying about calories \u2014 is an important, necessary indulgence.\nPerhaps when women and indulgence in food is depicted, there should be a Bechamel Test, based on principles similar to the Bechdel Test, the measure of the representation of women in fiction, which asks if a work includes at least two women communicating about something other than a man. The Bechamel Test could instead ask if the work includes a woman enjoying food while a) not on a dinner date b) not indulging because heartbroken by man and c) not ashamed of eating said food, before or after.\nHappily, there are many wonderful books which depict women eating and would easily pass; the much-loved Heartburn by Nora Ephron, the slyly subversive Supper Club by Lara Williams, and Breasts and Eggs, the debut English language novel by celebrated Japanese writer Mieko Kawakami. And, typically of a medium with less gatekeepers than traditional media, there are many podcasts which feature women happily discussing cooking, eating and yes, feasting; Hoovering with Jess Fostekew, and the Table Manners and Off Menu podcasts.\nTo enjoy food, to feast and to indulge \u2014 alone, with family and friends or at a shared table of strangers \u2014 is a pleasure which we should all be able to celebrate, joyfully and without shame.\n\nLucy\u2019s piece was originally published in our Feast issue.

It seems that a healthy handful of White folks wait to express their outrage and disgust over racial injustice after a highly publicized or sensationalized tragedy takes place. Often, after a new hashtag begins trending on social media, a variety of tweets and posts speaking out against anti-Blackness and anti-Black violence soon follow. Which, I suppose, is fine, but very few extend far beyond their comfort zone in their advocacy efforts. This is not to say that allyship in any form is not helpful, but it\u2019s time to start being clear about what is needed and what ultimately perpetuates White supremacy and further insulates White guilt. Let\u2019s be honest: to combat anti-Blackness in America, we don\u2019t need allies. We need abolitionists.\nWhite allies must move beyond hashtags and DEI professional development training to begin to scratch its surface effectively.\nAccording to The Anti-Oppression Network, allyship involves engaging in efforts that emphasize social justice, inclusion, and human rights by members of an ingroup to advance an oppressed or marginalized outgroup\u2019s interests. When I googled \u201cBlack allies,\u201d I found pages filled with articles soliciting the participation of Whites to join various social justice efforts. To be exact, almost 130,000 results populated my screen. Some articles made a strong argument for the importance and need of White allies, while others provided detailed instructions on becoming an effective ally. Conceptually, allyship sounds like it should be the kryptonite to anti-Blackness, yet time and time again, we are reminded that it\u2019s not. Allyship is a vague term, and its ambiguity can lead to various interpretations of what it means to be one.\nOn the surface, it could be assumed that allyship includes any of the following behaviors:\nExpress their concerns and frustrations about racism on social media.\nSpeak out against anti-Blackness in real-time.\nBe mindful of using racially inclusive language.\nBe familiar with some of the current and historic forms of oppression that have marginalized Blacks.\nUse their racial privilege to advocate for Blacks.\nJust as racism exists and thrives systemically and systematically to oppress the Black community, how we address anti-Blackness must also be systemic and systematic.\nWhile these are great suggestions, they only represent the tip of the iceberg in addressing a much more complex issue. Bigger than that, someone who might come across one of these \u201chow to be a White ally\u201d guides can pick and choose what they feel comfortable doing and call it a day. That might involve engaging in all of the above behaviors or only one. This still leaves a considerable amount to question: how often does an ally engage in these behaviors? On Mondays and Tuesdays, or do Saturdays and every other Sunday suffice?\nIn other words, at the bare minimum, someone who is White can support their Black co-worker after experiencing racism and walk away feeling as though their allyship itch has been scratched. Or repost a few well-written articles on anti-Blackness, participate in a Black Lives Matter march \u2014 and consider themselves an ally.\nYes, it\u2019s great to support marches that promote equity and disagree with racism by verbally supporting Black folks. But when well-intentioned White people who want to make a significant impact in addressing racism conflate engaging in these behaviors with dismantling anti-Blackness, they can walk away with a distorted and inflated sense of accomplishment that absolves them from the continued work that is genuinely needed. Of course, there is no cut and dry way to address anti-Black racism, but just as racism exists and thrives systemically and systematically to oppress the Black community, how we address anti-Blackness must also be systemic and systematic.\nAudre Lorde once said, \u201cthe master\u2019s tools will never dismantle the master\u2019s house.\u201d But for centuries, we have tried to do just that in the fight against racism. Yes, some strides have been made to create new laws that no longer openly discriminate against Blacks. Yet, some of these efforts remain incomplete. For example, federal laws were put into place to protect people of color from discrimination in the workplace after Black activists secured revolutionary civil rights legislation in the 1960s. Federal agencies were then tasked with holding people and institutions accountable for engaging in discrimination. Sadly, these efforts fell flat because lawmakers never fully funded these agencies and even provided exemptions, allowing many employers to continue to discriminate with little accountability. As a result, millions of workers of color continue to experience racial discrimination in employment and wages. Racist language also still appears in some home deeds across America.\nIt\u2019s clear that anti-Blackness does not only exist on social media or only in misdirected racial jokes at the water cooler while at work. Anti-Black racism is interwoven throughout the fabric of American culture. White allies must move beyond hashtags and DEI professional development training to begin to scratch its surface effectively. The term abolish is defined as \u201cend the observance or effect of (something, such as a law): to completely do away with (something),\u201d and an abolitionist is someone who supports and actively engages in efforts toward this end. This is a different perspective than allyship, which focuses mainly on working within the current system to promote equity. In contrast, abolitionists draw more from Audre Lorde\u2019s sentiments and focus on dismantling current oppressive systems to replace them with more equitable and inclusive structures.\nIn an ideal world, everyone would be against White supremacy and anti-Blackness. We would gather around a campfire, holding hands and singing kumbaya. But unfortunately, that is not our current reality. And until it is, the fight against anti-Blackness might not always be pretty or nice. It might sometimes require that people become upset with us and that we have to face discomfort in the face on numerous occasions. At times, it might be ugly, messy, and unpleasant. After all, the process of dismantling and rebuilding anything is rarely ever neat and clean. But when we look back at our blood, sweat, and tears, it will be worth it.", "comment_count": 12, "like_count": 815, "created_time": 1620245149710, "comment": [{"user_id": "226148ce4d9b", "comment_time": 1620245149710, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "86202e538d10", "comment_time": 1620482263988, "comment": "Thanks Maia for your article.

In a culture where quick abrasive quips and snapbacks are celebrated, Patton\u2019s light-hearted uber sincere response was a breath of fresh air. I can only strive to reach that level of happiness and lack of care and concern about the unsolicited opinions of others.\nEarlier this week, social media went ablaze after actress Paula Patton recorded herself making a controversial batch of chicken for her son\u2019s class. She was criticized for everything from not properly cleaning her clucks to seasoning the chicken after putting it in a skillet filled with oil to fry \u2014 and rightfully so. Cleaning chicken should always require more than a quick brisk brush through water, and seasoning chicken while frying defeats all sound logic. Be that as it may, Patton\u2019s response was priceless. She began the video by sending us her warmest and most sincere salutations from Mexico while she and her son were living their literal best lives. Captioned as \u201cPeace, love, and fried chicken,\u201d she said,\n\u201cI just wanted to respond and say listen; I get it. It might look crazy. It is the way we do it. My mom taught me.\u201d\nAll smiles and with flawless glowing skin, the \u201cMission Impossible\u201d actress clarified that she did wash the chicken thoroughly and that editing may have made it look otherwise. Patton also addressed how she seasoned the chicken, saying that she does have a new recipe and is open to suggestions but vowed to \u201calways make my mom\u2019s chicken the way she did it.\u201d \u201cWe put the seasonings in the oil and all that,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just the way we do it.\u201d\nBelieve it or not, this may be a teachable moment. So, before you dismiss her response and move on to the next, here are five things to learn from Paula Patton\u2019s reaction and the art of being unbothered:\nBeing unbothered is not a noun; it\u2019s an adjective. We often hear people claim that they are unbothered about a specific topic or situation while engaging in a passionate \u2014 and maybe even enraged \u2014 full-on monologue over the very subject they claim to be unfazed by. These types of responses are not cute and don\u2019t entirely give unbothered. In fact, they give pressed and are a dead giveaway that the person is very much bothered. In other words, being unbothered is not just a label that we can slap on a situation as steam billows from our ears. It\u2019s truly an action.\nConfidence doesn\u2019t have to be loud and boastful. In Patton\u2019s response, she basically said that she will continue making her crazy clucks the way her mother makes them regardless of our opinion, but that she is also open to entertaining other recipes. In other words, she said what she said and did not back down. She was confident in her decision, but she did not have to yell or go into a snap-back fit over her criticism. She communicated the same message with warm words and sun-kissed vacation skin.\nStop caring about the opinions of others. This has a lot to do with making decisions confidently. Making decisions that we believe in and feel confident about makes it easier to care less about what other people think. Folks will always have an opinion about the best way for you to live your life while they live their lives as they see fit. Take what makes sense and feels right for you and politely leave the rest. Either way, stop caring about what other people think and remember that rarely will you be able to make everyone in your life happy, and it\u2019s not your responsibility to do so.\nChoose your battles carefully. Between fighting against the evils of racism, sexism, and the multitude of other forms of injustice that plague the U.S., Black women and women of color overall, have enough on our plate. Many of us are weary. So, remember we don't have to fight every fight. Quite frankly, some things and some people do not deserve your time or energy. Be selective when choosing the hills that you\u2019re willing to die on.\nSmile more and be happy. It\u2019s a lot more fun to smile and be happy than to frown and be miserable. It\u2019s just that simple.", "comment_count": 19, "like_count": 1275, "created_time": 1649366906421, "comment": [{"user_id": "226148ce4d9b", "comment_time": 1649366906421, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "b952caed4ec6", "comment_time": 1649438978169, "comment": "I'm not familiar with the video or the actor but washing chicken in the sink is wrong and risky.

But purging toxic feelings is important for better mental health.\n\nAre you ever so overwhelmed by your thoughts or responsibilities that you feel stuck in quicksand? Or so emotionally out of control that you are easily triggered and often overreact to situations you typically wouldn\u2019t find stressful? Maybe, you\u2019re feeling withdrawn or wrestling with childhood trauma or rejections from the past that are affecting your present and future. Or, you might just be feeling drained and exhausted. Although we are only three months into 2022, the year has already presented some serious curveballs, especially for women of color \u2014 including myself.\nI recently did an emotional detox, and it was exactly what the doctor ordered. Most of us know what a physical detox is (think of the infamous green juice cleanse or master cleanse). In fact, I used to do the master cleanse more than Beyonce herself. But we don\u2019t hear nearly as much about how to engage in emotional detox and the possible benefits of doing so. I learned a few things about doing an emotional detox and how purging toxic feelings can lead to better mental health.\nWhat\u2019s an emotional detox?\nAn emotional detox includes engaging in behaviors and activities that eliminate emotions that directly interfere with optimal mental health maintenance and are tied to our physical health. Sounds easy, right? Maybe, for some. But, for me, disconnecting emotionally was more complicated than I thought it would be.\nLet\u2019s face it; we\u2019re part of a culture that values being busy over slowing down to \u2018sit\u2019 with ourselves. Constantly existing on autopilot tends to render us depleted, distracted, and disconnected, mainly from ourselves. Many of us have developed an odd relationship with some of the very things that leave us drained emotionally and psychologically. Although there are no quick fixes for processing, unpacking, or releasing the trauma, stress, and burnout that we carry with us from day to day, it is doable.\nTips for how to do an emotional detox\nHere are 14 suggestions to consider when preparing for an emotional detox.\nGet real\nResearch suggests the best way to begin addressing the cause of our stress is, to be honest with ourselves about what may be causing our mental or emotional discomfort or strain. Acknowledgment is the best way to begin addressing the root and clearing the path to healing.\nThe heart and mind are connected to the body\nAlthough there are differences between a physical and emotional detox, one characteristic inherent in both is eating healthy and nutritious foods and moving our bodies. Before starting your emotional detox, clean up your eating habits and get your blood flowing. These changes can look different for each person. Like me, you might decide to start slowly by removing soda from your diet or limiting the number of times you eat out. Others might opt for a more aggressive change by going vegan or committing to a vigorous excise regimen five days a week. Either way, psychologists and nutritionists stress the connection between the body and the mind. If we eat well, we tend to feel better physically, and when we feel better physically, that helps increase mental clarity.\nMake a plan before you start your plan\nThe first time I attempted an emotional detox, I failed big time. Then, I realized what I was missing. I didn\u2019t have a plan. Making a plan of action for your detox before you officially start is vital. Work on your plan in incremental amounts over a few days leading up to the start of your detox. I also found that setting realistic and practical goals that considered my day-to-day responsibilities and obligations that are non-negotiable was helpful. This might also be a great time to begin identifying and reflecting on what might be causing your stress or strain to tailor your plan according to your specific needs.\nClear your mind, and the rest will follow\nThere is nothing like a good brain dump to declutter our minds. Without editing or deep thought, I found it helpful to jot down random thoughts and feelings that came to mind, which included identifying my unconscious needs and some of the conflicts I have never verbalized. After engaging in your brain dump, read through your thoughts and identify patterns. Try to be honest with yourself about the consistent patterns you find. Forgive yourself. Emote. Ask what it is, when it comes up, who or what is causing it, why it\u2019s significant, where it\u2019s coming from, and plan how you will choose to release what\u2019s keeping you stuck.\nBe present\nAs difficult as it might be for some of us to not allow our minds to wander to the many tasks we have to complete or the day\u2019s event, it\u2019s essential to remain present and focused on your plan while detoxing.\nKick social media to the curb\nOr at the very least, use it responsibly. After creating your plan or engaging in a brain dump, you might find that social media is a trigger for you like it is for many others. Constantly watching the lives of others and the inevitable comparisons that we make between ourselves and the lives we see on social media can have a significant toll on our mental and emotional wellness over time. And if, for whatever reason, you find that you cannot completely rid yourself of social media for the entirety of your cleanse, limit your use and make sure only to visit sites and pages that bring you peace.\nIdentify and limit vices\nComfort-seeking behavior is a part of human nature, especially during stress or duress. Overly engaging in things like food and alcohol are the most common vices because they are also easy to access. But consistently engaging in these behaviors to dull the pain doesn\u2019t lead to the healing you are genuinely seeking. Making matters worse, overindulging can also lead to severe issues down the road, such as overeating, excessive weight gain, alcoholism, and overall poor health. So, stop before you reach for that glass of wine after an argument with your partner or a bag of chips after a long stressful day at work. Recognize the urge and engage in self-reflection about what is triggering that desire.\nAsk for help\nIdentify those in your life who you trust, and don\u2019t shy away from reaching out to them when you need their assistance. The same is true for speaking with a mental health professional. We have all needed someone at some point in our life. There is no shame in asking for help.\nForgive yourself and others\nMany of us hold onto grudges against ourselves and others, which can slowly eat away at our mental and emotional wellness. If this sounds vaguely familiar, give yourself some grace. Recognize that we all make mistakes. This is not to suggest that you shouldn\u2019t hold yourself and others accountable or that you must maintain relationships with those who have caused you extreme pain. Forgiveness is not an allowance. Forgiving yourself and others is the practice of acknowledging the upset, processing those emotions, and then arriving at a place where you can accept whatever happened, make peace with it, and release it.\nWallow in the \u201cgood\u201d\nLike any other detox, once you remove the impurities that weighed you down, you have to replace them with some \u201cgood stuff.\u201d Find the people and spaces that serve you, fill you up, and wallow in them a bit. Be intentional about engaging in activities and interacting with people who make you happy. Of course, everything you engage in will not leave you thrilled over the moon, and every interaction you have with other people will not leave you with hearts in your eyes. However, try your best to have those positive experiences as often as possible. Williams recommends using a gratitude journal to keep yourself focused and constantly grounded in a place of peace and appreciation.\nWhat\u2019s a post-emotional detox?\nHopefully, once you have completed your emotional detox, there will be behaviors, thoughts, perspectives, and attitudes that you will not want to return to. Like with a diet or a physical detox, if you go back to eating a pint of ice cream for breakfast, you may very well find yourself in the same situation again. This is why it\u2019s essential also to have a realistic maintenance plan. Here are a few other things to keep in mind post-detox.\nRepairing reduces repeating\nMake sure that you continue making intentional efforts toward repair and healing post-detox. \u201cWhat we don\u2019t \u2018fix\u2019 doesn\u2019t just go away. It may not be at a level of conscious awareness but always finds a way to the surface when we\u2019re activated or triggered.

Of course, social media immediately blew up, and people began dishing out their opinions and providing theories about the slap heard around the world. I have heard everything from conspiracy theories that the incident was staged for ratings to being staged to emasculate Black men further.\nIn my opinion, it is not that deep. But perhaps what we should question as a result of this incident is why Blacks in Hollywood have routinely been expected to grin and bear embarrassment and degradation without expressing any discontent or risk being viewed as angry? Furthermore, why is it permissible for a Black woman\u2019s health condition to be made content for a few cheap laughs at an award show and how will this incident overshadow the hard work of Will Packer, the Black man who produced the award show along with an all-Black team.\nWhile hosting last night\u2019s Oscar\u2019s Awards ceremony, Chris Rock said, \u201cJada, I love you. GI Jane 2, can\u2019t wait to see you,\u201d in reference to Pinkett-Smith\u2019s bald head. Will Smith then emerged from the crowd and served Rock with a fresh open hand slap in response. What might seem to have been an innocent joke was highly personal and hit a cord for Smith. Jada is not rocking a bald head to be on-trend or to appear avant-garde. She currently has short hair due to alopecia. In an interesting twist of fate, Smith won Best Actor for his role in \u201cKing Richard\u201d just minutes after the altercation. During his acceptance speech, Smith said,\n\u201cIn this time in my life, in this moment, I am overwhelmed by what God is calling on me to do and be in this world. Making this film, I got to protect Aunjanue Ellis, who was one of the most strongest, most delicate people I ever met. I got to protect Saniyya (Sidney) and Demi (Singleton), the two actresses that played Venus and Serena. I\u2019m being called on in my life to love people and to protect people and to be a river to my people,\u201d Smith said.\nHe also shared that he has had to turn the other cheek in previous incidents in which he felt disrespected throughout his career, \u201cYou gotta smile you gotta pretend like that\u2019s OK,\u201d he said. Well, I suppose last night, The Fresh Prince was fed up. And perhaps, rightfully so. I do not condone violence, nor do I think hauling off and slapping the taste out of Rock\u2019s mouth was the ideal reaction. But I do have empathy for a man who works in an industry that promotes stepin and fetchit politics and asks for Blacks and other people of color to grin and bear experiences of embarrassment and degradation or risk being labeled as angry or aggressive.\nThis is not about Will Smith and Chris Rock being Black or Will Smith \u201csetting Black people back\u201d or any other overly claims that I have heard in response to last night\u2019s incident. This is about a much larger systemic issue rooted in White supremacist culture designed to police the behavior of Blacks amongst the who\u2019s who in Hollywood and beyond. Respectability politics suggest that equity and fair treatment require that Black people \u2014 both inside and outside of Hollywood \u2014 conduct ourselves in a manner deemed acceptable to Whites. Furthermore, expressing any emotion other than complacence, apathy, or agreeance directly violates those norms, disqualifying us from receiving the same equitable treatment that Whites enjoy as a birthright. And sadly, there is a large group of Black folks who have internalized this toxic messaging.\nAgain, I am not suggesting that people should greet their grievances with balled-up fists or open-palmed slaps. But I think there is space for empathy and to discuss the system and the cultural norms and expectations that have created frustration in Smith and many other people of color which can sometimes present in this way. Bottom line: the joke was made in extremely poor taste. I have never witnessed a joke be made about the health of a White actress like Jennifer Garner or Angelina Jolie. So, why should it be acceptable for it to be made about a Black actress, and why are we so eager to only wag our fingers in judgment of Smith\u2019s behavior and not question the racist system that was designed to incubate his and so many others\u2019 frustrations. Perhaps, the most tremendous disservice this rumble has caused was overshadowing history being made before our very eyes \u2014 the hard work of Will Packer, the first Black man to produce the esteemed award ceremony with an all-Black production team.\nLet\u2019s raise a glass to them.", "comment_count": 35, "like_count": 1747, "created_time": 1648451900522, "comment": [{"user_id": "226148ce4d9b", "comment_time": 1648451900522, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "82f3fa60da17", "comment_time": 1648655035291, "comment": "Um, no.

That\u2019s a reasonable assumption, but it\u2019s dead wrong. \u201cCarried interest\u201d is a doctrine invented to make things fairer for 16th century sea-captains, and it has nothing to do with interest on loans.\nHow does a scam like that persist in the tax code for 500 years? Well, one thing the IRS Files showed is that lobbying for tax-breaks is an incredibly productive investment. Trump\u2019s \u201cbig, beautiful tax-cut\u201d underwent a flurry of last-minute revisions that carved out the tax-evasion strategies of individual billionaires and their dynastic offspring.\nThese can be directly linked to campaign contributions to the GOP lawmakers who introduced them. Like Senator Ron Johnson, who threatened to block the tax cuts unless it was amended to favor three of his major campaign donors: Dick and Liz Uihlein (owners of Uline), and Diane Hendricks (roofing heiress), who gave $20m to Johnson\u2019s campaign and reaped $215m in the first year of the cuts (they\u2019re still getting hundreds of millions on that investment).\nhttps://pluralistic.net/2021/08/11/the-canada-variant/#shitty-man-of-history-theory\nYou may have noticed the presence of an heiress among the Senator Johnson\u2019s owners: dynastic wealth plays an enormous role in shaping the US tax code and its policies. The American myth of the meritocracy has been extended to people whose \u201cmerit\u201d consists of emerging from an extremely lucky orifice.\nDynastic fortunes are normally shrouded in secrecy. But thanks to honorable heirs, like Abigail Disney, we are starting to learn more about the dirty business of \u201cfamily offices\u201d and the ways they ensure that no matter how feckless and idiotic an heir may be, they will continue to be able to influence the lives of millions of people who work for living:\nhttps://pluralistic.net/2021/06/19/dynastic-wealth/#caste\nThe tax code is a gnarly hairball of carve-outs and special programs, many of them designed to benefit middle-class earners, like the ROTH IRA. The ultra rich have turned these into piggy-banks they can stuff with hundreds of millions in tax-free loot. Peter Theil\u2019s ROTH is worth $5 billion.\nhttps://pluralistic.net/2021/06/26/wax-rothful/#thiels-gambit\nAnd REITs \u2014 which are supposed to benefit mom-and-pop landlords who rent out an apartment in their retirement \u2014 have been transformed into a vehicle for offshore oligarchs to acquire hotels, smash their unions, and siphon off money needed for the local tax coffers:\nhttps://pluralistic.net/2022/03/01/reit-modernization-act/#reit-makes-might\nNow, all work and no play make Steve a dull oligarch. The ultra-rich have figured out how to turn their hobbies and follies into tax-free money-pits, like Steve Ballmer\u2019s beloved LA Clippers. He evaded tax on $140m by buying the team \u2014 while his athletes (whose labor provides him with a handsome income) pay 30\u201340% income tax:\nhttps://pluralistic.net/2021/07/08/tuyul-apps/#economic-substance-doctrine\n\u201cFind a tax-sheltered hobby you love and you\u2019ll never work a day.\u201d That\u2019s the principle behind the hundreds of millions in tax-evasion practiced by the horsey set ($189m for tobacco billionaire Brad Kelley, $173m for soup heiress Charlotte Weber, $138m for hedge-fund looter Seth Klarman).\nhttps://pluralistic.net/2021/12/08/required-ish-reading/#hobby-lobby-ists\nBut if you just haven\u2019t found your passion yet, you can still trouser hundreds of millions, through the simple and effective tactic of cheating on your taxes.\nhttps://pluralistic.net/2021/06/20/la-hougue/#complexity\nDon\u2019t worry, the IRS has slashed its budget for auditing wealthy people and focuses its firepower on families with annual incomes of $35k and under:\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-04-13/democrats-ask-irs-why-tax-audits-for-poor-have-doubled\nThe IRS Leaks are a couple of years out of date now, and it\u2019s hard to know exactly how much worse it\u2019s gotten. One bellwether is the amount of debt assumed by the ultra-wealthy \u2014 when plutes borrow, it\u2019s not like you or I going into debt, rather, it\u2019s part of a \u201cbuy-borrow-die\u201d strategy through which unrealized, tax-free capital gains are used as collateral for cheap-as-dirt loans. The super-rich are levered up to their hairlines:\nhttps://pluralistic.net/2021/08/03/fitzgerald-was-an-optimist/#debt\nMeanwhile, President Biden has proposed a billionaire wealth tax, designed to get around the various tax-evasion strategies used by American oligarchs. Unsurprisingly, the wealthy are fighting back, insisting that they do pay tax, and lots of it:\nhttps://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/04/11/billionaire-tax-biden-unrealized-gains-assets/9503953002\nToday, Propublica\u2019s Paul Kiel, Ash Ngu, Jesse Eisinger and Jeff Ernsthausen offer a reality check on those claims, with an in-depth analysis of America\u2019s 400 top earners:\nhttps://projects.propublica.org/americas-highest-incomes-and-taxes-revealed/\nThe team start by observing that your effective rate of income tax does climb as your income does, but once you reach $29m, it plateaus \u2014 and then, it goes down, as extreme wealth unlocks access to tax evasion strategies that are beyond the reach of the merely rich.\nThe main way that the super-rich avoid tax is by arranging their payouts so they come as capital gains and not salaries, which are taxed at 20% rather than the 37% top rate for income derived from doing stuff, rather than owning stuff. Note that the 20% rate is only for long-term capital gains, and that means that nominally flippers who buy and sell assets quickly can\u2019t get it \u2014 but have no fear, private equity barons can pretend to be 16th century sea-captains and avail themselves of the carried interest loophole.\nThe US tax code has had special treatment for capital gains for about a century, but GW Bush\u2019s tax cuts in 2003 supercharged these breaks for the owning class. America\u2019s richest 400 people save an average of $1.9b/year thanks to ole GW.\nThe American tax-code is especially kind to people who emerge from lucky orifices. If you\u2019re in the DeVos or Walton family, tax giveaways are the key to your ability to shower candidates, PACs and think-tanks with money. 11 Walton orifice-emergers pocket $371m/year thanks to preferential treatment for dynastic fortunes.\nBut the real winners are tech billionaires, those rapacious, mediocre monopolists who have denuded the internet into five giant websites filled with screenshots of text from the other four. Their \u201ccharitable contributions\u201d of stock (which can simply be donations to their own family foundations) let them deduct the full value of the stock without any capital gains tax.\nThe top 400 American earners make at least $110m/year. That\u2019s 2,750 times the average American annual wage. The richest 11 US earners make more than $1b/year. A typical American would have to work for 25,000 years to make that much.\nDuring those 25,000 years, you\u2019ll pay more of your income as tax than billionaires. While they nominally pay a higher rate than you, you\u2019re paying a much larger share of your income into Social Security and Medicare, goosing your tax rate over theirs.\nNow all of this is a little misleading. The rich are actually richer than this analysis suggests. As the authors describe, \u201cthe richest avoid income when they can.\u201d By using the buy-borrow-die method, the wealthy actually pay a true tax rate of 3.4%.\nThat number shrinks even further when you consider America\u2019s top 15 earners who are singled out by name in a companion feature:\nhttps://www.propublica.org/article/americas-top-15-earners-and-what-they-reveal-about-the-us-tax-system\nDespite what you may have guessed, there are no celebs on that list. Even LeBron James and Taylor Swift don\u2019t approach the fortunes of the tech billionaires, hedge fund looters, and profession orifice-emergers atop the steep slopes of the American wealth-pyramid.\nCory Doctorow (craphound.com) is a science fiction author, activist, and blogger.

Doing the work you love, setting your own schedule, saying goodbye to the rats on the subway. But you\u2019re also quickly overwhelmed by the daunting prospect of, well, finding work, and the instability of good months and slower months. And just when you\u2019re starting to get the hang of it, that dreaded monster rears its head under the bed \u2014 the difficult client.\nEverybody has a different picture of what makes a client difficult. Figuring out the core traits of your own pain-in-the-neck type really helps you identify them and gently (yet swiftly) steer them in a different direction before they become an issue. For me, it\u2019s three things:\nCharacter compatibility. If I\u2019m going to be working closely with someone for a few months, I need to feel confident it\u2019s going to be a positive experience for both of us. The type of work I do is very collaborative and requires a lot of input and interaction, so having good chemistry just makes things go naturally smoothly. This is not necessarily about personality, but rather about certain character traits that will impact your working relationship. I ask myself, how would this person handle creative disagreements? Are they able to articulate their vision, what they like and don\u2019t? Are they driven more by passion or by ego? If those primary character qualities aren\u2019t aligned, the project is likely doomed.\nRelationship outlook. Some people value you as a partner whose expertise can help them grow, and some see you purely as a contractor to execute the steps they dictate. While it might be tempting to pick up some of those latter jobs to pay off some bills, it\u2019s best to avoid them. Those are the same people berating the waiter at the restaurant for their steak not being quite medium-rare enough. A client who doesn\u2019t value your expertise will approach any hurdles along the way as a personal affront. Having clear and similar expectations about the process and everyone\u2019s roles helps things run smoothly throughout the project.\nValue perception. One thing is being lean, and a very different thing is being cheap. Some prospect clients start a conversation by asking about your process, your team, your experience. Then there are those who seem narrowly focused on costs, not so much to make sure you are aligned in terms of budget, but because they clearly want the cheapest deal they can get. It also shows that they\u2019re not really that interested in what you bring to the table as much as using you as a way to get figures and go with the best deal, as one does when comparison-shopping for a new washer and dryer. You are not Home Depot.\nThese big red flags are different for everyone, but once you know what traits to look out for, you can spot these difficult types a mile away before wasting any time and energy. Becoming more skilled at choosing your clients is a catalyst to help your business grow. When you have good chemistry with a client and your values and expectations are aligned, the project is more likely to be successful, and the client will be more inclined to recommend you to their connections.\nDespite all the fine-tuning and careful listening, a lemon will slip through once in a while, or you might get into a difficult situation with a good client. And that\u2019s when I tap into the lessons I learned raising two very different but equally mystifying toddlers.\nLead with your reaction: when your two-year-old falls and scrapes her knee, half of what will ensue depends on how you react. If you get scared, she\u2019ll get more scared. Same with an upset client. If you get defensive, they\u2019ll escalate their point, and before you know it a massive tantrum unravels. And here\u2019s the thing \u2014 grown-up tantrums have nothing cute about them. Your initial response to an upset client can literally make or break the relationship, so pause for a few minutes or an hour before replying to that nasty email or returning an uncomfortable call. Frame the problem in the whole scheme of your relationship with this client, and think about the most practical approach.\nPick your battles: in work life as in parenthood, there are things to get rattled over, and things that are not worth the fuss. If a client calls with a small change after having given you approval on something, it might not be worth it to make an issue. If it becomes a pattern, then you\u2019d want to have a conversation about it. Again, being able to take a step back and look at the problem in the context of your work with this client will help you figure out if it\u2019s worth standing your ground or if it makes sense to be more accommodating.\nDon\u2019t take it personally: this one is hard. When your toddler refuses to even smell the homemade macaroni and cheese you just spent 45 minutes on because it has crumbs on it, I can tell you from personal experience that it\u2019s pretty tough not to be personally offended. Same goes for a client who gives you unnecessarily harsh feedback, or changes deadlines with no notice. Try to think about what\u2019s happening on her end. She\u2019s likely not doing these things with the goal of making you miserable. Like most humans, clients often pass on their stress to the people they work with, so chances are it\u2019s not about you or your work. Take a breather, remove your ego from the equation, and assess the situation from a more neutral point.\nShow them some love: just like young children, positive reinforcement is a healthy way to ease a sticky situation. Think of something positive to add to the conversation to get unstuck and help them take a step back too. There\u2019s a reason why you\u2019re working together, right? Remind your client that you appreciate them. You know I love working with you, and I\u2019m glad we figured this out. Let\u2019s schedule a time to talk about next steps tomorrow.\nMove on: and I mean actually move on. Don\u2019t think about sassier comebacks you should have used, or replay the interaction on your head. Take note of any lessons from the experience, figure out if you need to make adjustments to your relationship with the client, and focus on a different project to help you reset. Be productive with your time and energy, it comes in limited supply!\nIt\u2019s hard being the adult in the room when someone is throwing a tantrum, but it comes with the job. Remembering that you\u2019re half of the equation and adjusting how you deal with tough situations with clients will change your perspective, and in time, hopefully, lead to fewer tantrums.", "comment_count": 1, "like_count": 112, "created_time": 1555685651077, "comment": [{"user_id": "b7de5a928c5", "comment_time": 1555685651077, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "1933a0f84e4b", "comment_time": 1559266267576, "comment": "Teresa, those three red flags you describe are EXACTLY the way I choose clients too.

Literally\nWhen your child doesn\u2019t fit in a neat box, parenting can feel like an extreme sport \u2014 and school is often the ultimate challenge\nPhoto: Erika Fletcher/Unsplash\nThat morning, I was one of the parents unable to hold back tears as our kindergarteners closed out the school year with a performance of \u201cCount On Me,\u201d a song by Bruno Mars. This being 2016, their big smiles were in full display, all baby teeth and pride in their colorful Hawaiian shirts and plastic sunglasses. Unlike with the other parents, my tears weren\u2019t prompted by the cuteness of the situation \u2014 which was definitely overwhelming.\nWhat did me in was a sudden, emotional rush that I was powerless against. The struggle of the last 10 months came down on me like a torrential rain as I watched my six-year-old sway his hips to the music. \u201cYou can count on me like one, two, three\u2026 I\u2019ll be there.\u201d Kindergarten is supposed to be a magical year of finger painting, stick figures, and first friends. For my sweet boy, it had been a daily uphill battle that he had no chance of winning.\nMy son has ACTG1-associated Baraitser-Winter syndrome. It is a rare genetic condition that presents with progressive hearing loss, development delays, and neurological differences. It doesn\u2019t exactly roll off the tongue \u2014 with a name like that, you\u2019d think the poor kid might have sprouted a second head, but on the surface he\u2019s a fairly normal child. Whatever \u201cnormal\u201d means.\nI didn\u2019t know any of this yet as I watched him sing that morning at the auditorium \u2014 he would be diagnosed two months later. What I knew was that New York City had broken my heart as it embraced my neurotypical older son but turned its back on this bright neurodivergent boy. Naively, I had assumed that this epicenter of diversity and progressive values would be the place for a child like him to thrive. A couple of weeks before the performance, the elementary school he attended, where the word \u201cinclusion\u201d flowed as freely as fidget spinners, had politely showed him the door by recommending he attend a program for intellectually disabled children. Which made no sense for him at all. We love inclusion! Let\u2019s include everybody in our public schools! Just, uh, just not those kids.\nEvery year, thousands of parents in New York City have to prove their child\u2019s need for an education the city refuses to provide but is happy to write checks for. Once you give up on having your kid attend the same public school as their friends and neighbors, the most viable option for those who can afford to is to enroll them in a private school and sue the city for tuition reimbursement.\nThe lawsuits move forward on the grounds that the city blatantly fails to provide children with learning differences with an appropriate public school option, as required under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. This is no small-fry line item. In 2018 alone, the city spent over $800 million dollars on private school tuition for children with learning disabilities, per the New York City Department of Education.\nCan you imagine what the city could achieve if it invested $800 million a year to provide these students with the public education they have a right to, rather than shuffling them off to private school? What would our public schools look like if they weren\u2019t just talk about inclusion, if they really wanted to serve all students?\nTwo months after the performance that put an end to kindergarten, in August 2016, we made a trek to a fancy hospital in the Upper East Side. The pediatric geneticist\u2019s office felt more office than medical \u2014 there was no exam table, but rather a desk and four plush chairs arranged on either side. She welcomed us both warmly and made small talk with the six-year-old whose genetic secrets she knew and we didn\u2019t. After a couple of minutes, she looked at me and smiled. \u201cWe found something,\u201d she said, and I reflexively handed my unlocked phone to the impatient little hands waiting next to me.\nWe were so accustomed to this drill. At doctor\u2019s office after doctor\u2019s office, for years, we\u2019d start with a short first act when he\u2019d take center stage. They\u2019d put things in his ears or make him sit still like a statue for a \u201cspecial picture\u201d or poke around his stocky little body. Intermission was when he received a sticker or a lollipop and the doctor in question turned their attention to me. The second act was spent with the doctor talking to me about my son as if he weren\u2019t even there. He would get restless fast, his ADHD years from being diagnosed but fairly rampant nonetheless, and I would hand over the phone to keep him busy but also because it pained me to be talking about him like this right in front of his face.\nJust about every parent believes their child is one in a million. Mine literally is. At the time of his diagnosis, only about 50 cases of Baraitser-Winter had been recorded.\nThat\u2019s not a typo. Not 50,000. Fifty, five zero.\nI looked away from the doctor and felt strangely calm as I watched my son gleefully blasting angry birds into space. I knew in that moment that we were going to be okay.\nI expected the diagnosis to be this revelatory moment. Trumpets playing in the background as I finally got all the answers I had spent years searching for. Since the day he was born, I had been on a long-winded mission to understand what might be going on with this hilarious, thoroughly uncoordinated snuggle bug who got everyone in his pocket within seconds. We had visited one specialist after another, most of the time leaving with half-baked answers and a parking ticket. And now here we were, with a diagnosis that tied it all together: the progressive hearing loss, the development delays, the quirky wiring.\nThe truth is, the diagnosis was more relief than revelation. I could stop driving us batty searching for answers and simply be his mom. I still didn\u2019t have all the answers \u2014 no parent ever does. But it enabled me to focus my energy on what was in front of me.\nAs far as the school system is concerned though, the diagnosis was a game changer. They won\u2019t listen to a child\u2019s own parent, what would they know! But a doctor, from Cornell! Please, this way, ma\u2019am, let us see what we can do.\nI didn\u2019t end up suing the city in 2016. But I sure as hell pulled him from that school that had shown no intention of walking their lofty inclusion talk. Eventually, we moved north, seeking more space and an environment that welcomed both of my kids and enabled them to thrive.\nDespite the challenges of the last two years of pandemic life, the move has been a game-changer. With school no longer a daily struggle, where he was othered and minimized, a square peg forced to fit in a round hole, my son has grown to become more confident and is an excellent self-advocate. For the first time, he actually looks forward to going to school every morning.\nThat\u2019s what all parents want, right?\nParenting can often resemble the most demanding of extreme sports, with all sorts of obstacles and judgement along the way. When your child is one in a million, or simply learns differently, the obstacles seem to multiply and get up close and personal \u2014 and school can be the tallest hurdle. But in the end, we\u2019re all trying to get to the same finish line: for our kids to be happy, accepted, and celebrated just the way they are.\nThis June, that former kindergartener will be moving up to middle school. I already know I will be a mess at his elementary graduation \u2014 once a crybaby, always a crybaby. But this time I know for a fact that what I\u2019ll feel will be joy and so much pride, as I watch my son continue to forge his path, walk his own walk.", "comment_count": 19, "like_count": 1640, "created_time": 1648492433064, "comment": [{"user_id": "b7de5a928c5", "comment_time": 1648492433064, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "1b87cb2eae7", "comment_time": 1649089565324, "comment": "I hear that all the time about \"progressive\" schools... only so when it fits their mold and identifies with their values of what \"inclusion\" and progressiveness means."}, {"user_id": "20b6738f03c7", "comment_time": 1648976331871, "comment": "Thank you for sharing, Teresa, and I am so glad that your son has you as his mother, who is so supportive, to be his side every stepof the way!

When the raspy ups and downs persisted long after the wrapping paper had been carted away, I concluded the exhaustion from the long journey south had taken a toll on him. We had just spent two driving on scenic I-95 to avoid flying in the early days of the Omicron surge. Surely all that recirculated air and steady diet of drive-through food must have done a number on the poor boy.\nBut the next morning, as I was about to head out for a morning walk with the pup, it hit me. I stood by the front door scanning the neat row of flip flops, looking for mine, but they were nowhere to be found. As I studied the row yet again, hoping to summon my sandals into manifesting themselves, I zeroed in on his. It was as if the white shark fins scattered on the black rubber soles were waving at me, trying to get my attention. I slipped my right foot on, then my left, and I stood there staring at my feet, dumbfounded, absorbing the indisputable fact that my eleven year old\u2019s flip flops fit me perfectly.\nWhat in the actual fuck?\nYou would think I would have seen it coming. But I really did not.\nWhen I first become a parent, when I met that tiny helpless baby, time entered a warped new dimension.

The story is absolutely bonkers and also, in true Shonda Rhimes fashion, plain addictive. Halfway through the show though, something strange happened. I found myself having a funny feeling: I was kind of identifying with Anna\u2019s quest to make ADF a reality.\nAlmost a decade ago now, I undertook a project that was somewhat similar in principle \u2014 with some key differences that precluded criminality, thank you very much.\nMy project did involve a stunning building, an elevated multi-layered experience, and a young enterprising European gal in New York (me) who had never done anything quite like that before. On the flip side, the scale of my project was a gazillion times smaller, nobody got stiffed and I have no problem admitting that I did dress like I was, uuh, poor.\nAnother key difference is that my project actually did become a reality. In December 2013 I launched Brooklyn Holiday Bazaar, an annual holiday market that went on to flourish until its final edition in 2019, right before the pandemic hit.\nFor years I had been musing about what an ideal craft fair would look like. I was devoted enough to local handmade goods and entrepreneurship that I kept a blog about it \u2014 blogs were the podcasts of 2012 \u2014 and visited craft fairs around New York City the way other people go to Disneyland. I loved discovering new makers, listening to their stories, understanding what goes into the process and craft of creating small-batch products. More often than not, I left handmade markets inspired by the people selling their wares and unsatisfied about the events themselves. Some were simply too big and overwhelming, or there was nothing to eat. In the winter, during the peak holiday season, venues tended to be dark and depressing, and if I had my kids with me there was nothing for them to do other than whining and unwittingly attempting to get lost.\nMy mental map of this ideal event came into razor-sharp focus over time. I knew exactly what the different moving parts should be and how they would work together to create a greater whole. I saw it all in my head just as vividly as Anna saw herself walking the halls of 281 Park Avenue flanked by billionaires. Dreams sometimes become too real to shake off, so despite having zero event experience and no connections in that world (not to mention a full-time job I loved and two small children), I set off to figure out how to make it happen.\nThe first piece of the puzzle was the most crucial: securing the perfect venue. Beautiful, bright, big enough but not too big, with connected spaces to allow for different activities beyond shopping. I had attended a couple of events around that time at a venue that fit the bill perfectly. 501 Union gave me the first victory by agreeing to host a one-day event for a reasonable fee, but they were also the first check I had to write, which was pretty scary. Cue self-doubt spiral: \u201cI\u2019m putting my money where my mouth is, but what if nobody wants to participate? Or worse, what if we manage to assemble a great lineup, but no one shows up?\u201d From what I gather, Anna never had those types of thoughts, or fulminated them instantly if she ever did. I signed the check, and after those initial butterflies, I set off to work.\nOne by one, I convinced dozens of talented local makers to give the show a chance and spend one of the busiest days of their holiday season at my event. Local restaurants came on board to serve food at the event, beverage brands signed up for the bar. Kids activities got fleshed out. A sponsor agreed to provide gift wrapping free of charge. The design team that I am immensely lucky to run in my regular job created marketing visuals that helped the event seem much more solid that first year. And I worked my tail off to get the word out.\nDecember 14 came around in 2013, and the event was an honest success. People came. Lots of them. They spent good money. They found unique things they loved, and they had a great time. The vendors asked when we would be doing this again.\nThe next day, still pulsing with excitement and exhaustion from the day before, I started working on a 2014 event.\nPhoto by Scott Salembier for Brooklyn Holiday Bazaar\nOver the next six years, my rogue little fair would grow to become a multi-day series featuring the most talented makers in town, drawing thousands of people each day and bringing me more joy and pride than I can begin to describe. Like the makers whose work I so admired, I created something out of nothing. My tools were different, but I too had managed to take an idea, shape it until it was just right, and put it out for the world to enjoy. And it became a business of its own right. For four months every year, I juggled what basically amounted to two full-time jobs, both of which were my design.\nEventually, the event came to its final edition in December 2019. There comes a time in just about every Brooklyn real estate relationship when the rent ought to be doubled. It happens. That turn of events coincided with me leaving the city for the Hudson Valley\u2014a moment of major change. I decided to give myself time to reimagine what the next iteration could look like, to find my new 281 Park Ave in the country.\nAnd then the pandemic hit. The temporary hiatus was extended somewhat indefinitely, and I came to realize that there was no point in trying to recreate what had been perfect. I had managed to make that dream-like vision a reality. I had learned so much, and had enjoyed every minute of it. Instead of always chasing more, more, more, sometimes it\u2019s best to close a chapter when we feel satisfied.\nI wonder \u2014 if ADF had materialized, would it have been enough for Anna?\nWhen it comes to inventing ourselves, we are the ones who have the keys to the car. How we go about turning those persistent dreams into reality almost always involves a certain dose of fake-it-til-you-make-it.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.\nTo subscribe to the podcast and hear the interview for yourself, you can check it out on iTunes, Spotify, and Overcast.\nIn May, Amazon VP and distinguished engineer Tim Bray said he was leaving the company. Amazon had just fired employees who spoke out against its working conditions, and Bray couldn\u2019t tolerate it. He handed in his resignation and published an astonishing blog post detailing his decision \u2014 an unprecedented move for an executive inside the tech giants. \u201cI choose neither to serve nor drink that poison,\u201d he wrote.\nBy listening to Bray, we can learn a bit more about how people inside the tech giants view their power and how they might drive change as Congress and regulators stand still.\nAlex Kantrowitz: Does it feel painful, or do you feel like you did the right thing?\nTim Bray: Well, both. It was the world\u2019s greatest job, and I really liked the people, and AWS is a treat to work for. But that was just not a thing that I could let go by.\nI want to read something from your departure letter. You said that \u201cfiring whistleblowers is evidence of a vein of toxicity running through the company culture. I choose neither to serve nor drink that poison.\u201d Could you help us understand what that toxicity is?\nWell, I\u2019m really not going to be able to explain it because I don\u2019t understand it. I spent five and a half years at Amazon. I would say it is an exceptionally well-managed, well-run company. These days, in the days of late capitalism, there\u2019s a lot of things to displease even mildly progressive people about the way big companies are run. And Amazon operates within the rules of businesses as they currently operate, and that leads to some things like situations in the warehouse that concern people. Obviously, it didn\u2019t concern me enough for me to quit because I kept on working there for five and a half years. But then when this firing the whistleblowers and activists thing started, that just seemed different. It didn\u2019t seem like a thing that a company ought to do within or without the rules. It just felt wrong and not something that I was comfortable with.\n\u201cThe entire basis of 21st-century capitalism builds in a huge amount of disregard for people in blue-collar jobs by people in white-collar jobs.\u201d\nAnd I think when you carry a VP rank, you really need to be able to speak for the company in a comfortable way and explain its reasons for the things it does, and I couldn\u2019t, so I didn\u2019t.\nHaving said that, not only did I find [the firings] ethically challenging to an unacceptable degree, I thought it wasn\u2019t very smart. Have these people never heard of the Streisand effect? It seems like firing activists is like pointing 50-foot arrows of fire at a situation and saying, \u201cOh, there\u2019s something here we don\u2019t want you to hear about.\u201d So I was disappointed in that. But I just did not feel I could be a public-facing person as part of a company that did things like that.\nYeah. Then going back to the toxicity, is it more of a disregard for worker conditions? Is it a disconnect between people in the white-collar jobs and the blue-collar jobs at Amazon? How would you describe it?\nWell, I think that the entire basis of 21st-century capitalism builds in a huge amount of disregard for people in blue-collar jobs by people in white-collar jobs. And Amazon is by no means the worst. I mean, you could look at Walmart, you can look at any number, particularly in the agricultural sector, the meat-packing plants and so on. Amazon is by no means the worst. But I think that is not an Amazon problem. That is a societal problem. And if we do not like the way that blue-collar workers are treated, we need to do old-fashioned regulation and legislation to deal with that.\nHaving said that, I thought that firing activists was qualitatively different. It was a step over the line and not just a routine part of the practice of modern capitalism. It was just something I couldn\u2019t be comfortable with.\nIn terms of the whistleblowers, can you tell us a little bit about what the story looked like on the inside? We know that it was pretty challenging in the middle of Covid-19 for Amazon to maintain safety precautions inside the warehouses, and there was a feeling inside that people were just like, \u201cThis isn\u2019t going to work.\u201d\nOh, I disagree. I don\u2019t think that there was a \u201cthis isn\u2019t going to work\u201d feeling. I think that is absolutely the case that Amazon invested a huge amount of time and effort in trying to make the warehouses safer and operable. At the same time, we were hearing repeated and sustained objections from the staff who didn\u2019t feel safe at work, and I didn\u2019t have any trouble believing both of those things: That Amazon was working hard at this, and that there was still a lot of deeply expressed concern among the staff. I don\u2019t believe for a moment that Covid makes it impossible to do business. We\u2019re going to have to figure out how to do it, and things may run slower, and they may be more expensive, but I certainly wouldn\u2019t be a defeatist about it.\nYou mentioned that it wasn\u2019t smart for Amazon to fire the whistleblowers. Why do you think they did it? Because you\u2019re right. It does bring more attention to the things that they\u2019re speaking up about.\nI absolutely do not know. Sorry, but I just don\u2019t.\nIs there a tolerance for dissent inside Amazon?\nThere is a huge tolerance for dissent inside Amazon. One of the core leadership principles they run the company on is \u201cdisagree and commit,\u201d which means that dissenting opinions are not only acceptable, they are sought out, actively sought out in the context of any really important decision to make sure that new people know what\u2019s going on. And I think the effect of that is that, as part of the leadership, the company may choose decisions that go in different ways than what you\u2019d like to see, but generally you have the feeling that you were listened to, that you may have lost the argument, and that\u2019s certainly happened. During my time in leadership there, there were some big arguments that I lost, but that was, at the end of the day, okay. And I was willing to go and publicly defend the position that we took because I felt listened to. But that only goes so far. And when the occurrence that happens is way outside your ethical bounds, that\u2019s different.\nI wonder if \u201cdisagree and commit\u201d inside Amazon applies when it comes towards building things that Amazon wants. And I wonder if they live that leadership principle when it comes to dissent or when it comes to allowing for disagreement on things in terms of ethics and not in terms of product development.\nObviously, once you have a regulatory framework, large organizations are going to skate right up to the edge of it, and that\u2019s why regulations have to be very carefully written. But I would have to say that during my time there, I simply did not see anything that I thought was even remotely illegal or unethical. The problem isn\u2019t that. Amazon says that they manage things in a customer-obsessed way, and that is absolutely true. And if you look at what Amazon\u2019s retail side offers, they offer broad selection, low prices, and fast delivery. Well, how could anybody be against those things? Those are obviously good things.\nHaving said that, nothing is free. There has to be a price for everything. And I think I have a broad concern, not just for Amazon in particular, but for our economy and society as a whole, that when you work out the arithmetic there, the experience and life of the powerless is not factored into that arithmetic, and the structure of our society makes that far, far too easy.\nAnd I return to my main point, which is that this isn\u2019t an Amazon problem; this is by and large a societal problem. It comes from the really unacceptable difference in power and wealth between the powerful and the powerless. It\u2019s what was described as the 1% versus 99% problem. And the structure of our society is such that people like those who work in the warehouses have essentially very little bargaining power. Specifically in the United States, they have even less because the regulatory framework in America is so powerfully anti-union. And then what even sharpens the contrast is that in America, your health insurance is tied to your employment. So the prospect of losing your employment is terribly, terribly frightening. And all those things work together to create a situation which I think needs to be changed.\nDid people inside Amazon senior ranks ever talk about these issues? It seems like it\u2019s something that\u2019s being discussed in their politics overall, but I\u2019m curious if it actually gets discussed inside the workplace.\nOh, no, generally not. There was very, very little political discussion. We were, in Amazon Web Services where I worked, we were trying to solve the problem of making IT better by applying cloud technology. And let me tell you, that was a big enough subject to occupy 150% of our time.\nWhat do you think would have happened if you were to bring up the fact that \u201cwe here at Amazon are working in a broader system that does lend itself at times to worker exploitation?\u201d\nWell, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a secret that I was a person with progressive opinions. I\u2019m also a loud-mouthed environmentalist, and by Canadian standards, I am moderately progressive, which means by U.S. standards, I\u2019m sort of a basic, red-toothed commie. Here in British Columbia, the province I live in, we have a provincial government that is not far off where Bernie Sanders is in the States. So, I don\u2019t think anybody didn\u2019t know that I had a lot of progressive opinions.\nOkay. But if you were to voice them, do you think the leadership was by and large concerned, for instance, with worker well-being?\nWell, let me tell you, in the context of AWS, Amazon Web Services, we, because I was a member of that leadership, were extremely concerned with worker well-being. And just an example of that, when Covid came along and all of a sudden we started a massive, large-scale work-from-home experiment, we bent over backwards to make sure that this was working out for people because work from home works for some, but not for others. If you\u2019re a small family living in a small apartment with kids who suddenly aren\u2019t going to school, work from home can be pretty hellish.\nYeah, but what about the retail workers though?\nI have a point here that I want to make which is that we took extreme interest in how this thing\u2019s working out, and we worried a lot about the AWS workers. And I think that illustrates something important. The fact of the matter is that the Amazon Web Services workers are mostly engineers and knowledge workers who were empowered. They were high-paid, and if they didn\u2019t like their job, they could walk across the street and get another one. And so here we have one group of workers who are being taken really excellent care of and another group of workers who are expressing terrible fear and concern about their health and safety at work. Well, what\u2019s the difference? It\u2019s power. Other workers who are empowered get a much better level of treatment from their employers.\nDo you think companies can push change here? I mean, given your discussions with leadership, do you think that a company can say, \u201cThis is how the system works, but we\u2019re not going to operate by the rules just because we can, we\u2019re actually going to do better by workers,\u201d or do you think it\u2019s going to take the government to change them?\nI really wish if I or the president of United States were to talk to the big companies the way I talked to my kids saying, \u201cNow play nice or no dessert\u201d kind of thing, that would work, but it won\u2019t. I absolutely think that it is precisely the role of government and politics to address this kind of situation. And if some of us are concerned with the way that people are being treated in context such as warehouses, then what we need to do is to change the regulatory and legislative framework so that it is no longer acceptable to do that. And I\u2019m sorry, that means getting down and grinding out boring old politics, knocking on doors, finding candidates to support, organizing behind them. Politics is a slow, messy, and, for many people, unpleasant business, but it\u2019s the tool we have for changing things in society we don\u2019t like.\nThat\u2019s interesting. So when you were in Amazon, did you believe in having the government come in and regulate the company? Or was it only after you left did you think that regulation would be the move?\nIn Canada, I\u2019m a supporter of a party called the New Democratic Party, which is currently the government here in my local province, which is pretty well along the lines of the Democratic Socialists in the States. So yeah, I actively gave money, and my family went out and knocked on doors and things like that. So yeah, I\u2019ve been politically active on and off for years.\nBut in terms of actually wanting Amazon itself to be regulated, I guess it would come in terms of being regulated as far as the way that worker protections are implemented overall. But when you were working there, is that something you wanted? You wanted to see the government come and rein it in?\nSo, I absolutely do not want to regulate Amazon. I want to regulate the operation of the larger economy. I think the rules should be the same for all big companies, and I think the rules should do a much better job of empowering the powerless in society. So, yes, I\u2019m an activist. Yes, I would like to see stronger regulatory and legal frameworks. No, I\u2019m not particularly interested in going after Amazon in particular.\nRight. So just capturing Amazon in a regulation that would affect the broader economy. What percentage of Amazon executives do you think hold that perspective?\nBy and large, the technology workers tend to be vastly progressive. In the American context, that means they tend to vote for and give money to Democrats rather than Republicans. Obviously, the higher you move up the food chain, probably the less is true, but I\u2019ll be honest, I never had a political discussion with a member of the senior leadership team. One of the reasons for that is that being in leadership at a large successful company, such as Amazon, Amazon Web Services, is fantastically fun. It\u2019s about the most fun you can have and get paid for. And when you\u2019re doing it, it occupies 110% of your attention. And you might be the kind of person who just simply doesn\u2019t want to think about politics at all because you\u2019re just too busy making customers happy and making the business work. So the rank and file, sure. Rank and file, I\u2019m sure that I was not really a big outlier. Senior leadership, it\u2019s a mixed picture.\nThere are these two different ways people register dissent inside companies. One is they go and they bring their issues internally and try to get it fixed that way. And two is they exit. So why did you choose exit?\nWell, I didn\u2019t. I did both. I did, in fact, raise the issue internally and had some extensive discussions before I left, and the reasons I left we\u2019ve discussed fairly clearly. And for people who want to dive deeper, if you go and Google for the string \u201cBye Amazon, Tim Bray,\u201d you\u2019ll come up with the piece I wrote, which goes into a great deal of depth about that. So, certainly. I felt as a duty as an employee to express my opinion strongly to the right people. And I did that, and having done that, I then left the company.\nWhen you brought those issues up internally, what did people say? Were they like, \u201cTim, what are you talking about? This is sort of the way we do business?\u201d\nWell, unfortunately, those are probably covered by my nondisclosure agreement. And I was a team member, and I trusted and valued my team members, and I just don\u2019t think it would be appropriate for me to go out and dive into the details of that.\nDid you generally come away with an impression thinking that things could possibly change inside Amazon, or did that seem sort of like something that wasn\u2019t going to happen there?\nI\u2019m just not going to dive into that, but having said that, I do believe that as I was saying a little earlier, the technology knowledge worker workforce is by and large a very progressive demographic and has had relatively little involvement with politics historically. We\u2019re starting to see that change. There\u2019s my story. There\u2019s been some activism over at Google. There was an outburst of dissent over at Facebook. I suspect that should the knowledge worker demographic wake up and realize that it has a lot of political power potentially and start exercising it, that could be a really substantial force for a change in our society. So, you asked specifically, do I think Amazon has the potential to change? I don\u2019t know, but I do think that Big Tech has the potential to, as a reflection of the activism of its employees, become a force for change and progress in society.\nBut we also have been through a year of employees standing up and speaking their mind. You look at Google, that\u2019s an analog. A lot of the Google activists have left the company. At Amazon, there are either activists like you who sort of did your activism on the way out or the whistleblowers who ended up getting fired. I\u2019m a little pessimistic that the knowledge workers can get anything done given their track record so far. What do you think?\nWell, I\u2019m a natural optimist, but I would actually disagree with you. I think that five years ago, we had zero employee activism. A couple of years ago, we had a little bit. Last year, we had really quite a lot. Amazon did, in fact, for example, change its posture on climate, the climate emergency. I doubt they would come out and say it was because of employee activism, but I\u2019d be surprised if it was entirely unrelated. I think that the potential for this to grow and get traction, particularly in a year of, in America in particular, profound political disturbance is not trivial. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised at all to see some real game-changing activism going on.\nWell, here\u2019s a question for you. One thing that Amazon is pretty clear about is its obsession with customers. And we talked a little bit earlier about how that means giving people low prices and getting things to them quickly. And I\u2019m curious what would happen if customers got together and started to lobby it, essentially saying, \u201cHey, we\u2019re the customers. Your leading leadership principle is you\u2019re obsessed with us and what we want, and it\u2019s not just about getting the box quickly. It\u2019s about treating workers better, being better stewards in society.\u201d How do you think that would be received inside of Amazon if it was a big enough movement?\nI don\u2019t know. I mean, Amazon is not kidding when they say they\u2019re customer-obsessed and they say that they listen to what the customer is saying. And occasionally we hear people saying, \u201cWell, I\u2019m going to boycott Amazon. I\u2019m not going to buy stuff there anymore.\u201d And you\u2019re proposing a hypothetical scenario where people say, \u201cOkay, well, we\u2019re going to start boycotting Amazon unless we see more evidence of a humanistic outlook.\u201d\nNot a boycott. This is more like you can lobby the government and still be a citizen, essentially saying, \u201cWe might still be Prime members, but we want you to actually respond to some of the values that we see in the world. This is what your customers want.\u201d\nI suppose. I think that broad selection, low prices, and fast delivery at the end of the day speak very, very loudly. And those are good things and things that I certainly support focusing on. I think it was John Adams who first said, \u201cWe live in an empire of laws, not of men\u201d\u2014of course, we\u2019d say people now\u2014but I think that\u2019s true. And I think the most appropriate way to try and change the shape of society is through operating in a rules-based manner and instituting rules that you think everybody can compete equally on the basis of and let the best competitor win. And right now, I think that the facts on the ground demonstrate that the rules tolerate an unacceptable imbalance in power and wealth. And we just need to change those rules. I\u2019m not saying people shouldn\u2019t try and organize the kind of thing you talk about, but my own preference would be for old-fashioned political activism.\nQ: \u201cDo you want to break these tech giants up?\u201d\nA: \u201cOh, absolutely.\u201d\nI think it could happen in both ways, but I\u2019m just curious how you think Amazon leadership would respond if they saw a broad movement within their customers to essentially lobby them as if they were a government and say, \u201cIf you\u2019re customer-obsessed, this is what the customers want. If you\u2019re obsessed about us, you should respond to these concerns.\u201d\nIt would be an interesting conversation, because obviously people would be concerned by saying, well, if we do that, and as a result, we have to extend our deliveries or raise our prices, would they decide to go across the street to Walmart? You\u2019d have to really have sufficient critical mass to address those concerns. And that\u2019s why I think you should go and apply that hammer to Amazon and Walmart at the same time. And the best way to do that is through politics.\nDo you want to break these tech giants up?\nOh, absolutely.\nWhy?\nWell, I think that if you look at organizations, several reasons. If you look at organizations like Google, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, to start with, they\u2019re simply too big. It becomes intractably difficult to operate in a humanist way, either towards your employees or your customers when you\u2019re operating at that scale. Secondly, the tables are stacked. The pattern you normally see with these Big Techs is that they have stumbled across some really great piece of business that throws off a fountain of cash, which they then use to fuel invasions of other sectors, putting the incumbents in the other sectors at a competitive disadvantage.\nI mean, the classic example is web search ads on Google, one of the most insanely profitable businesses that has ever existed, which has enabled them to do a bunch of bad things. I mean, they\u2019re doing office automation with Gmail; they\u2019re doing maps and ads on maps and reviews on maps with maps. They have lots of other businesses. And another side effect of that is that they and Facebook have established a duopoly in the advertising business, which are putting the continued existence of advertising-supported publications at a huge risk.\nIn the case of Microsoft, it\u2019s the continuing cash cow of Office and Windows that throws off this fountain of cash that is used to subsidize Microsoft\u2019s various other business ventures. And I just don\u2019t think that is something that legal frameworks should allow. And, in fact, they didn\u2019t used to. There was an era of antitrust in the United States where that kind of behavior was simply not tolerated. And I\u2019d like to turn back the clock a little bit and go back to that.\nFascinating. Chances you think that will happen?\nI think there\u2019s actually quite a lot of antitrust energy, latent antitrust energy built up in the American populace as a whole. And in general, this affection with Big Business in general and Big Tech in particular, that\u2019s been dramatic. As recently as five years ago, the Big Tech companies were kind of broadly admired and their leaders were sort of hero-worshiped, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true in 2020. I think there is \u2014 my departure and the reaction it got is another small piece of evidence for that. So I think that, depending on how the election goes, I would be really not surprised to see an aggressive ramp up in the strength of antitrust activism.\nWell, we will see. All right. Last question for you before we leave. You wrote this \u201cBye Amazon\u201d post; you\u2019re sitting there about to hit publish. What did it feel like in that moment?\nIt was hilarious. Not so much that moment but a few moments later. So I wrote it over the weekend after I\u2019d left, Friday being my last day, and I published it late Sunday night getting towards midnight. And I have my own little server that my blog runs on, and I was a little worried about the configuration and so on, and so I stayed up until two in the morning after fooling around with the server, just making sure everything was optimized and image loading and all the stuff you normally do. And, forgetting that I was now an unemployed bum, I still had my alarm on for early in the morning. So, well before seven in the morning, my alarm goes off and I wake up, \u201cOh, I don\u2019t have to get up. Wait a second. I should just see, did that get any reaction?

He proposed buying the company\u2019s shares at $54.20 each, a $9 per-share premium, presenting its board with a tough decision.\nMusk is a brilliant businessman. He founded one company that sends rockets to space and another that popularized electric vehicles. But selling Twitter to him isn\u2019t as simple as turning it over to a master builder. Let\u2019s take a deeper look:\n1. This may be a farce\n\nMusk admitted in his SEC filing Thursday morning that he hasn\u2019t yet completed the financing to buy Twitter. He reaffirmed that on the TED stage later in the day. Musk in the past said he had funding to take Tesla private and ultimately didn\u2019t follow through. He may be toying with Twitter, angry that his first attempt to influence it via a board seat didn\u2019t work out.\n2. The most likely outcome is Musk sells his shares\n\nIf the Twitter board calls Musk\u2019s bluff or spurns his offer, he can walk away, sell his shares, and antagonize from the outside while saying he tried his best. Musk is also likely interested in punishing the board and the company for the false flirtation that took place last week. His most likely path is to sell.\n3. Twitter is less valuable if Elon runs it as a private company\n\nPart of the appeal of Musk\u2019s involvement is it turns Twitter into a meme stock, a place where retail investors pour their cash. If private, that aspect goes away, which will make it tough for Musk to get outside investors to go along for the ride.\n4. Twitter should not be a private company\nTwitter should be accountable to the public in some way. It serves a critical public function, and taking it private would make it subject to an individual\u2019s whims. The best way to ensure accountability is for Twitter to remain a public company. Musk, or anyone else, taking it private would be a shame. That being said, Musk is trying to divide the private ownership of Twitter among thousands of people, vs. consolidate it in his hands.\n5. Musk has no clear roadmap\n\nMusk\u2019s said Twitter is \u201csimply not a good investment without the changes that need to be made.\u201d But so far, the changes he\u2019s outlined have been somewhat incoherent \u2014 outside of his call for less moderation, which is something that\u2019s actually made Twitter more money in recent years. Musk\u2019s call for more transparency around algorithmic tweet promotion and demotion is a solid proposal, however.\n6. I have serious questions about Twitter\u2019s leadership after this\n\nThe company welcomed Musk with open arms just last week. It tried to get him on the board. It failed. Now he\u2019s toying with it and threatening to take it over. It\u2019s chaos for employees and investors. It\u2019s fair to ask if Twitter\u2019s current leadership is up to the task.\nTo receive my newsletter, Big Technology, in your inbox every Thursday, you can sign up here.", "comment_count": 1, "like_count": 72, "created_time": 1649950354267, "comment": [{"user_id": "fdd22680024c", "comment_time": 1649950354267, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "e3baf910175b", "comment_time": 1650037532232, "comment": "Fun fact: Elon Musk didn\u2019t even found Tesla he just literally bought the title of \u201cfounder\u201d.

The service is fast-moving, emotional, and wildly unpredictable. So your ad \u2014 depending on the moment \u2014 could appear next to a funny meme or a neo-Nazi flame war. For many marketers, that\u2019s been a reason to stay away.\nTo solve this problem, Twitter\u2019s recently turned to vigorous content moderation. A company that once deemed itself the \u201cfree speech wing of the free speech party\u201d now aggressively polices speech \u2014 sometimes to a fault. As it\u2019s become more \u201cbrand safe,\u201d ad dollars have poured in. Last year, Twitter made $5.08 billion, up 37% from the year before, its best year on record.\nWith its business taking off, Twitter is now poised for a fascinating conflict with Elon Musk, its newest board member and largest independent investor. Musk, who bought 9.1% of the company, is not your standard activist investor. Typically, when people make such moves, they do so with the conviction that they can make money by driving change within the business. But Musk seems more interested in changing Twitter\u2019s product and policy, even if it comes at the expense of its bottom line.\nMusk has, for instance, criticized the content moderation that\u2019s boosted Twitter\u2019s business. As he was buying his shares last month, he said that \u201cfailing to adhere to free speech principles fundamentally undermines democracy\u201d and then asked if a new Twitter competitor was needed. Apparently, he decided to pursue reform from the inside, and this week promised \u201csignificant\u201d changes ahead.\nThough Musk may have a hard time changing Twitter policy, he\u2019ll inevitably be at odds with the company\u2019s business operation if he pushes a content moderation rollback. Few Twitter employees cheered Musk\u2019s involvement this week, and the uncertainty around the business likely factors heavily. This isn\u2019t about politics, as some say, but revenue. Advertisers want comfort. Musk wants Twitter to return to its freewheeling roots. And that places him on a collision course with the people inside the company responsible for making their numbers. The atmosphere inside Twitter could get awkward quickly.\nThere are ways Musk could address his beliefs around speech without changing the current moderation rules. Primary among them would be to accelerate Twitter\u2019s transformation into a decentralized protocol, essentially turning the service into many different Twitters, each with their own rules, allowing you to join the one you want. Twitter is currently working on an initiative called Bluesky to push this forward, though it\u2019s progressing slowly.\n\u201c\u200b\u200bIt will super interesting to see how this accelerates things Twitter has been talking about for years,\u201d said former Twitter communications head Brandon Borrman, on Wednesday. \u201cAlgorithmic choice, open source protocols, decentralization, a biz model that moves away from ads.\u201d\nEven if some advertisers stay away from Twitter due to brand safety concerns, it may not necessarily harm the company\u2019s revenue. The buzz Musk generates could attract more marketers, and some are already salivating at the energy he\u2019ll bring to the company. \u201cHe will exponentially amplify the recent tangible product momentum at the most opportunistic time, given the very public recent challenges at Facebook, Pinterest, and other platforms,\u201d said one marketer at a major brand. \u201cOnly non-serious marketers would pull back on Twitter.\u201d\nMusk\u2019s involvement in Twitter\u2019s speech policies may, in some regards, be needed. The company, for instance, went overboard during the 2020 election, blocking links to legitimate stories about Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop. But getting to a place that\u2019s satisfactory to Musk, those inside the company, and its advertisers will be messy. That said, Wall Street is betting they figure it out. The company\u2019s stock is up 22% this week.\nThe above is a selection from Alex Kantrowitz\u2019s Big Technology Newsletter, a weekly note on tech and society.

It\u2019s not the return of the free market, but it\u2019s something.\nPhoto by @felipepelaquim on Unsplash\nFor years, a chorus of critics has argued Big Tech is too powerful, unaccountable, and anti-competitive. And for years, it\u2019s seemed like they were shouting into a pillow. Antitrust legislation meandered in Congress, the tech giants continued to squeeze their competitors, and they added trillions in market cap in the process.\nBut now, the Big Tech antitrust movement is actually making real progress. On Thursday, the EU adopted the Digital Markets Act, a landmark piece of legislation aimed at restoring the market competitiveness that the tech giants have hindered. One day earlier, Google said it would allow some Android app developers to take payments directly, avoiding its Play Store\u2019s processing and fees. After a long period of stagnation, these moves are breakthroughs.\n\u201cFrom now on, Big Tech companies must show that they also allow for fair competition,\u201d said European Parliamentarian Andreas Schwab on Thursday. \u201dThe time of long antitrust cases is over.\u201d\nThe week\u2019s most crucial reforms promote fairness in app stores, where the tech giants have wielded their power most acutely. Apple and Google\u2019s dominance over app developers has enabled them to charge \u2018taxes\u2019 that no developer would pay in a fair market. To run an app on iOS or Android, app developers routinely pay 30% of their proceeds to Apple or Google, leading to increased prices for users and lower profits for their businesses. But now, the tech giants will have to back off their taxes, either by will or by force.\nThe EU\u2019s Digital Markets Act, for instance, has a provision compelling the tech giants to allow users to install apps from outside platforms. So people in Europe could soon have an option to install apps from either the iOS App Store \u2014 where developers pay the tax \u2014 or go elsewhere and avoid it. This could open up legitimate competition between independent developers and Apple\u2019s native apps, and lower the prices for apps more broadly.\n\u201cEuropean consumers are on the verge of enjoying better protection than U.S. consumers,\u201d said Luther Lowe, who\u2019s spearheading Yelp\u2019s antitrust push. \u201cThe ball is in America\u2019s court to curb the most egregious forms of self-dealing by these trillion-dollar gatekeeper platforms.\u201d\nAlready, Google is starting to implement a version of the EU\u2019s reform globally. On Wednesday, it announced a partnership with Spotify that would allow Android users to sign up for Spotify\u2019s service directly. Spotify will place its payment option right next to Google\u2019s, giving users a choice \u2014 just like the free market.\nThough Spotify will pay Google a fee for the privilege, it was happy to agree to it. The company said it met its \u201cstandard of fairness.\u201d A spokesperson said Spotify would welcome a similar conversation with Apple, but it hasn\u2019t heard anything from Cupertino.\nAs with GDPR, there will be messiness. Implementation of some of the EU\u2019s new rules \u2014 especially around messaging app interoperability \u2014 could be treacherous. But this is what happens when an industry fails to self-regulate. The government can step in and do it for them.\nWe\u2019re starting to see some moves that could\u2019ve warded off the EU\u2019s intervention \u2014 such as Google\u2019s reform with Android \u2014 but it\u2019s looking like it\u2019s too little too late. The tech critics had some valid points. And after seeming ineffective for some time, it\u2019s clear they\u2019re going to land some punches.\nThe above is a selection from Alex Kantrowitz\u2019s Big Technology Newsletter, a weekly note on tech and society.

With the help of a slightly nervous producer who lived a short bicycle ride away, I did the the next on March 13 from my Brooklyn living room, describing my own Lockdown, Day 1.\n(That was the week the World Health Organization declared Covid-19 a pandemic, flights from Europe were cut off, and Americans were urged to stay home. Life suddenly got simpler \u2014 and a lot scarier.)\nNow, exactly one year later, I\u2019m slouching toward immunity.\nI got my second shot on February 27, so my boosted antibodies and primed T-cells are now kicking in. Saturday, March 13 is my second-shot-plus-two-weeks point.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has just ruled that people like me can tiptoe partially out of hiding. If we tread carefully, we can see our grandchildren or hold small dinner parties indoors with other double vaccinees.\nThat\u2019s wonderful news for us.\nBut the news for the country as a whole is anything but wonderful. Though we have dropped from January\u2019s peak, we seem stuck at nearly 60,000 new cases a day. That is twice as bad as the terrible spring surge that drove us all indoors.\nWe are vaccinating a little more than 2 million people a day. In a population of 330 million, most of whom may eventually need two shots, that\u2019s not fast enough.\nI\u2019m vaccinated only because I got ridiculously lucky.\nDuring my last Daily appearance, on January 27, I lamented that, like many of my Brooklyn neighbors over age 65, I could not find an open vaccine slot.\nA colleague who heard that emailed me the next day to say that a few had just opened up at the Brooklyn Army Terminal and if I moved fast, I might snag one.\nI did, and got my first Moderna dose at 2:14 AM on January 29, meandering from one trailer to another in the terminal\u2019s parking lot in the freezing cold.\nHaving listened to and read a lot of other people\u2019s stories, I think I can honestly say that this is the biggest mess of a vaccine rollout I\u2019ve ever covered. It is a Keystone Cops m\u00e9lange of confusion, delays, legal nitpicking and missed opportunities. We could do better.\nSome examples:\nAs the last patient of the night at the Army Terminal, I wandered along the parking lot\u2019s chain link fence looking for a doorway, feeling like a character from Hogan\u2019s Heroes trying to break into Stalag 13.\nAndrea, the nurse who ultimately gave me my shot, very kindly let me stay inside her warm trailer for the 20-minute observation period instead of shivering in the outdoor tent. I wasn\u2019t holding her up: she had four hours to kill until the next patient was scheduled at 6 A.M. She\u2019d brought her Bible to read.\n(A month later, on the day of my second shot, it was raining. The forms we filled in were damp, people huddled under umbrellas outside the shot trailers, and the observation tent wasn\u2019t just chilly \u2014 it also leaked.)\nMy girlfriend volunteers in a New York hospital as one of the greeters at their vaccine clinic.\nAfter inoculating its staff, her hospital began calling in its cancer patients, eldest first. The result was heart-breaking, she said.\nMultiple times a day, fragile 80-year-old patients would arrive with their equally frail 80-year-old spouses, begging for shots for both. The hospital had plenty of vaccine on hand, but it had to refuse because of state rules enforced by steep fines. The elderly spouses were on their own.\nI have friends over 65 who have driven four hours to Utica and five hours to Plattsburgh to get shots. Another signed up through the Duane Reade chain. He got his shot at a pharmacy just a block from his home \u2014 but he had to wait weeks longer.\nPaul, a 53-year-old friend, signed onto a pop-up website that he had been told tracked \u201cleftovers\u201d at vaccination sites where missed appointments meant doses would be thrown away.\nAfter a false start or two, he ended up at the El Caribe Country Club in Brooklyn\u2019s Mill Basin section \u2014 which incidentally plays a pivotal role in the life of Trump\u2019s former consigliere, Michael Cohen, as described in his weirdly engrossing memoir, \u201cDisloyal.\u201d\nAfter being screened at three different tables, Paul was told that leftovers were only for those over 65 or with certain co-morbidities.\nMiffed, he started to leave but was told that, if he waited, there might be more leftovers than eligible patients.\n\u201cWhich I did, and lo and behold, I got vaccinated at the very end of the day as they were packing everything up,\u201d he said.\nPaul\u2019s 17-year-old son got vaccinated at the Medgar Evers College site run by Air Force personnel. He brought his paystubs to prove he was a restaurant worker; no one asked to see them.\nHearing that, a friend of Paul\u2019s went straight over with her daughter. Neither had front-line jobs; both got vaccinated anyway.\nA cousin of mine in his 20\u2019s has friends who are doctor-shopping, hoping for letters saying they need shots because of various medical problems, like asthma. They apparently do not recognize that they don\u2019t need the letters. You can \u201cself-certify\u201d that you have a condition.\nAnother friend has a son at Cornell who is due to get a shot this week because he lives in a \u201ccongregate setting.\u201d The law treats his frat house as the equivalent of a nursing home.\nThis is ridiculous.\nSecond Covid shot 8:42 A.M. February 27, Brooklyn Army Terminal\nAnd the ridiculousness of it puts us in danger. The new variants are spreading fast. It behooves us to outrun them, so that cases don\u2019t go up again and hospitals don\u2019t get crowded again. When hospitals are overwhelmed, survival rates plummet.\nWe need big, organized, dry, warm, well-ventilated vaccine centers running 24 hours a day.\nThey need separate lines for people in wheelchairs, separate lines for essential workers like teachers so we can get schools open again, and a backup plan for missed appointments so that not a single shot goes into the garbage.\nEverybody I spoke to who has managed to get an appointment at Manhattan\u2019s Javits Center has come away happy about the short waits and military efficiency. Perhaps that is the model to follow.\nAnd we need to not let unnecessary rules push us around.\nFor example: you are discouraged from getting a Covid shot if you have had any other vaccine recently. Why is that? Vaccines don\u2019t \u201ccancel out\u201d each other.\nAt the age of two months, in just one visit, a typical American baby gets eight vaccines: hepatitis B, rotavirus, diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, HiB, pneumococcus and polio.\nAs an adult, I\u2019ve had as many as five shots at once in a travel doctor\u2019s office for exotic things like rabies and Japanese encephalitis. Military members get far more.\nIt\u2019s All About Speed\nIn poor countries, nearly every battle fought with vaccines \u2014 whether against yellow fever, cholera, polio or Ebola \u2014 focuses on one goal: speed.\nTo increase speed, doctors are willing to sacrifice almost everything else: careful record-keeping, the doctor-patient relationship, even vaccine efficacy.\nDuring big polio-eradication drives, which routinely vaccinate more than 1 million children a day, teams walk through train stations and border posts asking only two questions: \u201cIs your child under age 10?\u201d And \u201cMay I give him/her vaccine?\u201d The only record-keeping may be that the child\u2019s pinkie nail is inked with a marker that takes a week to wear off.\nWhen people are threatened both by cholera and by fighting and are in full flight, Doctors Without Borders sometimes gives everyone one oral vaccine dose on the spot and then entrusts heads of families with a second set of vials and instructions to take them two weeks later.\nIn 2018, almost 25 million Brazilians faced a fast-moving yellow fever outbreak when there were fewer than six million shots left in the global vaccine supply. As the virus approached the favelas of Rio de Janeiro and S\u00e3o Paulo, the government switched to one-fifth doses and sent mobile teams into the alleys to buttonhole people, fill in minimal paperwork and inject them where they stood. It worked: By 2019, the threat was gone.\nDoctors Without Borders recently completed a study showing that one-fifth doses of yellow fever vaccines save more lives during epidemics than delivering full ones. The protection doesn\u2019t persist as long \u2014 but it lasts long enough to stop the spread, which buys time for everyone to get booster doses later.\nShots for rabies, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis, typhoid fever, tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis, April 2014\nIn my experience, American public health experts place too little trust in their patients. They assume many will fail to get their second doses or will prematurely stop taking precautions.\nIn normal times, that might be understandable. But during epidemics, most people are highly motivated to save their lives and those of their children and parents. They readily follow instructions like \u201ccome back in four weeks.\u201d\nThe easier you can make it for them \u2014 centralizing appointment scheduling, giving out Metro cards or taxi vouchers, letting churches or other social organizations book bloc appointments for members \u2014 the better the chances of success.\nStriving for perfection saps that.\nAnd while vaccine hesitancy is a big problem at the moment, the best cure for it is first-hand knowledge. Anyone who knows two families, and sees the unvaccinated one suffer three deaths while the vaccinated one suffers none becomes a vaccine-seeker. This is true even in the mountains of Pakistan where the Taliban holds sway: mothers who have seen children with withered legs seek out polio vaccine \u2014 sometimes ignoring their husbands\u2019 orders and even death threats. That\u2019s why the polio-eradication campaign tries to hire only mothers as vaccinators; their first pitch is \u201cYes, I vaccinated my kids and they\u2019re safe.\u201d\nOther countries are figuring out that speed is everything.\nOn December 30, facing a rampaging new variant with too little vaccine, Britain asked its citizens to wait three months between doses instead of one.\nSince then, they have \u201cfully vaccinated\u201d only two percent of their population, while we have done 9 percent of ours.\nBut they are almost twice as good as we are at delivering one dose: 33 percent versus 18 percent.\nTheir tactic seems to be working: since Jan. 11, cases in Britain have dropped 90 percent and are still going down. Ours dropped 75 percent and plateaued \u2014 and the variants are still not yet dominant here.\nEvidence is rapidly mounting that one dose of any one of the authorized vaccines provides very strong protection against hospitalization and death.\nThat is the metric that matters. If no one in Wuhan had died or been hospitalized, we might still not have noticed this new bat virus circulating in people.\nOnce you become very unlikely to die or suffer major organ damage, Covid-19 becomes a threatening but almost always survivable disease, like influenza. Catching it acts as your second shot.\nJohnson & Johnson\u2019s one-dose vaccine appears 100 percent effective at preventing hospitalization or death.\nOne dose of Pfizer vaccine, according to Israeli researchers, is 85 percent effective at preventing any symptoms after 15 days have passed; it is probably far more effective against death. Canadian researchers found similar results.\nOne dose of either the Pfizer or the AstraZeneca vaccine reduces hospitalization risk by about 80 percent, even among the frail aged, according to British researchers.\nIt would seem obvious that giving 200 million Americans better than 80 percent protection against death would save more lives than giving 100 million Americans complete protection and leaving 100 million with none.\nAnd, since one dose appears to also lower transmission risk, even more lives will be saved.\nIf we move fast enough, manufacturing may become the limiting factor.\nMoncef Slaoui, the former chief scientific advisor to Operation Warp Speed, has suggested doubling the already available supply of the Moderna vaccine by giving out half doses.\nIn early trials, he noted, 50 microgram doses produced antibody levels just as high as 100 microgram ones; the company went with the larger one because it was unsure how well the vaccine would ultimately work and because it would increase shelf life.\nModerna\u2019s vaccine turned out to be vastly more effective than the company envisioned, and shelf life is a non-issue when speed is vital.\nAnd the fussing over brands is ridiculous. All the vaccines are based on the spike protein. But some Americans have become as brand-obsessed as if they were Prada bags or Cabernets.\nWhy bother? When we get flu shots, do we ask if we\u2019re getting the Sanofi-Pasteur, the GlaxoSmithKline, the Protein Sciences, the MedImmune or the ID Biomedical of Quebec?\nI don\u2019t. I do ask for the more powerful \u201csenior shot.\u201d There are two brands, which work in different ways \u2014 one has extra vaccine, the other contains an immune-system booster. I take whichever is available.\nI also don\u2019t ask whether that year\u2019s shots are 40 percent effective or 60 percent effective. That is a measure only of its efficacy against any infection with one of four different influenza strains (all of which are farther apart genetically than various Covid \u201cvariants\u201d are from each other).\nI get an annual flu shot because it is much better than that at preventing death.\nA 2018 New Zealand study often cited by the C.D.C. showed that, over the course of four flu seasons, with both good and bad matches, flu shots reduced the chances of being admitted to an intensive care unit by 82 percent.\nI\u2019m not afraid of missing a few days of work or of feeling miserable. I very much want to avoid I.C.U.s, which are the approach ramp to the morgue.\nThat \u2014 rather than fussing over side effects, reinfection, asymptomatic transmission or matching second shots \u2014 ought to be our national goal.\nThis is a lethal disease; more than anything else, we need to pull its fangs as quickly as possible. With the biggest threats gone, we can reopen schools, workplaces and restaurants and get the economy moving again. And then we can turn to helping the rest of the world do the same.", "comment_count": 10, "like_count": 491, "created_time": 1615295243362, "comment": [{"user_id": "d58b26425136", "comment_time": 1615295243362, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "b7ef6e86feba", "comment_time": 1615510337789, "comment": "Your reporting has been the beacon I turned to for guidance at every stage of the pandemic.

Not from what I can see now\n\nColumbia University\u2019s medical school just held a week-long symposium on pandemic vaccines, which I attended and spoke at.*\nWe heard from 40 experts, virtually all (other than me) specialists at fighting infectious diseases, from the W.H.O., the C.D.C. and its Chinese counterpart, from Operation Warp Speed, Pfizer and the Serum Institute of India, from the Gates Foundation, the Wellcome Trust and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations.\nIn the end, I was struck as much by what was not said as by what was.\nEveryone agreed that the vaccines were miraculous, that it was a shame that poor countries did not get them in time, that it was tragic that the anti-vaccine movement did so much damage.\nBut almost no one wanted to discuss mandates. No one defended the idea of negating vaccine patents. And no one suggested counter-attacking the anti-vaxxers \u2014 even though they have literally killed millions.\nIn their urge to be liked, public health leaders seem to have forgotten that their vocation was once, like the military, quite a tough-minded profession. Public health leaders were often hated \u2014 because they were expected to curtail the rights of an angry few in order to save the lives of the many. In abjuring that role, they are consigning innocents to die.\nHere are the major points that were made:\nIt Isn\u2019t Over\nWe in America are moving on \u2014 doffing our masks, crowding bars and offices, riding subways again. For those of us who are at least triple-vaxxed or who have survived a bout, the virus now is what Donald Trump and other denialists were claiming it was two years ago: roughly as threatening as the flu.\nBut it may not be finished with us yet.\nWestern Europe is suffering a second Omicron wave, noted Dr. Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust (Britain\u2019s equivalent of the Gates Foundation). Airlines are scrapping flights as crews fall ill. In some countries, like Germany, it\u2019s higher than the first and deaths are rising. We have not yet felt it here \u2014 but we still could.\nAlso, if China loses control of its \u201czero Covid\u201d policy \u2014 which looks increasingly likely \u2014 it will have an explosive epidemic. Although 85 to 90 percent of the country is vaccinated, said Dr. George F. Gao, director of China\u2019s C.D.C., vaccination is low among the elderly, the vaccines are not very effective and almost no one has protection from previous infections. Rapid spread among 1.4 billion people may mean many deaths \u2014 and a host of new China variants. (One has already been found in Jiangsu.)\nOn the other hand, China does not have a large population of partially immunosuppressed people, as southern Africa did because it has so many cases of untreated AIDS. Omicron\u2019s 40-plus mutations probably took place in one person infected for many months, argued Dame Kate Bingham, leader of Britain\u2019s equivalent of Operation Warp Speed. Any variants China produces may have incremental changes rather than wholesale ones.\nAlso worrying: the virus is finding more animal hosts, like white-tailed deer. Every new species could be a route to new variants. (The 1918 flu eventually found its way into pigs, which became vessels for brewing new strains in later decades.)\nDeaths May Be Three Times the Official Toll\nThe \u201cofficial\u201d death toll of the virus is 6 million. The true toll, according to different epidemiological models, is probably between 16 and 20 million.\nDifferent experts viewed this differently. Some felt the world should be congratulated on keeping per-capita mortality low compared to the 1918 flu.\nOthers felt the world has done poorly considering that about two-thirds of those deaths occurred after vaccines were approved.\nDr. Soumya Swaminathan, the W.H.O.\u2019s chief scientist, likened the deadly delay to that of AIDS a generation ago: triple therapy became available to Americans and Europeans in 1996. But it took 10 more years until it was widely available in Africa at affordable prices.\nOne worrisome indication that excess mortality could rise further: shifting over to Covid vaccination has disrupted routine childhood vaccination in half the world\u2019s countries, said Dr. Katherine L. O\u2019Brien, the W.H.O.\u2019s head of immunization. Millions of youngsters may now be unprotected against diseases like measles, whooping cough and diphtheria that are far more dangerous for children than Covid is.\nVaccine Production Great, Distribution Not\nAlthough most Americans are familiar only with Pfizer, Moderna or Johnson & Johnson, the world is actually using 36 different vaccines, 10 of which are W.H.O.-approved. China, India, Russia, Cuba, Iran, Canada, Taiwan and even Kazakhstan have one or more home-grown ones. Despite all the attention lavished on mRNA technology, the vaccine that has probably saved the most lives is the Oxford/AstraZeneca one, according to an analysis by the Economist. It is approved in 176 countries and made in both Europe and India.\nVaccine production has been extraordinary: almost 12 billion doses so far. Before the pandemic, the world made only about 4 billion a year for all diseases. (Most vaccines are for the 130 million children born each year, noted Martin Friede, the W.H.O.\u2019s chief of vaccine technology transfer. The market for adult vaccines, such as shingles and flu, is relatively small.)\nBut distribution has been inequitable.\nEven 12 billion is only half of the total need: If it takes three shots to reliably cheat death, that\u2019s 24 billion doses to protect the whole world.\nOf that 12 billion, less than 2 billion reached the poorest countries. Rich countries have now consumed about 200 doses per 100 people, or 2 shots per person. Poor countries, including most of Africa, have consumed only about 32 shots per 100 people \u2014 one-third of a shot per person.\nNonetheless, uptake has flat-lined. Some countries, including South Africa, asked vaccine makers to stop sending doses because people aren\u2019t taking them.\nThe delay is not just because wealthy countries bought up the early doses. In poor ones, it can be hard to deliver any refrigerated vaccine outside the capital cities because of power failures and shortages of basics like syringes and trained vaccinators. Also, while outright hostility to vaccines is quite low, \u201cvaccine apathy\u201d is high, as Wilmot Godfrey James, a South African social sciences researcher and leader of the symposium noted. In surveys, many Africans said they knew little about the vaccine or felt that other threats they faced \u2014 everything from unemployment to malaria \u2014 were more pressing.\nThe populist solution to shortages \u2014 seizing vaccine patents and handing them over to local companies \u2014 is doomed to fail, numerous vaccine experts argued.\nAny new vaccine may involve up to 20 patents, each with a different licensee, and most aren\u2019t registered except in wealthy countries. The real obstacle is that producing millions of identical contamination-free doses requires know-how that is not patented, deep benches of medical and engineering talent and infrastructure that poor and lower-middle-income countries lack. Even the Serum Institute of India, the world\u2019s largest vaccine maker, seeks out partners for new vaccines instead of trying to build them from scratch, said Dr. Gagandeep Kang, an Indian vaccine researcher. Also, vaccine companies will not create competitors who hope to steal their best customers, argued Moncef Slaoui, the head of Operation Warp Speed; about 80 percent of profits, he explained, come from the world\u2019s richest dozen countries, so a plant that can make 200 million doses for $1 apiece cannot survive without the few customers who want only 20 million doses but will pay $30 each. When countries build their own vaccine industries, as Brazil, Cuba and others have, they end up relying on old technology: vaccine plants must be run and updated constantly. They can\u2019t be mothballed between crises.\nNo argument in favor of seizing patents was made. (Pfizer was one of the symposium sponsors.)\n\u2018Trust Cannot Be Surged\u2019\nVaccines aren\u2019t accepted unless there is trust, all the communications specialists agreed: trust in science, in political leaders, in the vaccine industry.\nBut it must be in place before the crisis. \u201cTrust cannot be surged,\u201d said Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the former C.D.C. director.\nTrusting government, however, is almost antithetical to the nature of democracy. We cling to democracy precisely because it lets us vote out leaders we lose faith in.\nIt is also hard to predict which governments will end up trusted. Some democracies do well at vaccinating their citizens \u2014 Australia, New Zealand, the Scandinavian countries, Canada, Portugal, Chile and Argentina. But so do some autocracies: China, Cuba, Vietnam, the United Arab Emirates. Meanwhile, some of each do poorly. In vaccine acceptance, our democratic United States is below virtually all of western Europe and Japan and on a par with Iran and Saudi Arabia. But the autocracies of the former Soviet Union \u2014 Russia and most of eastern Europe \u2014 do even worse.\nThe defining factor seems to be whether citizens trust their government on health issues. Cuba, for example, may jail political dissidents, but it gives all citizens health care. The U.S. has free speech but leaves millions of Americans uninsured.\nTrust in the pharmaceutical industry is also low in the United States because it charges us the highest prices in the world and its lobbyists stop Congress from fixing that.\n\u201cTrusted messengers\u201d are key to instilling trust. They can be anyone from a family doctor to a religious or sports figure\u2026or even a traditional leader or local shaman. But messaging works best when it comes from the top.\nDr. Frieden held almost daily briefings during the 2009 swine flu, Ebola and Zika epidemics. His Covid-era successor, Dr Robert R. Redfield, held almost none \u2014 and ceded leadership at White House briefings to President Trump, the most untrustworthy messenger imaginable. (Even Trump\u2019s adoring fans reject his advice on boosters.)\nMore than one speaker cited the example of the King of Morocco, who sat at his desk in his undershirt for the cameras as he got his first shot. Morocco and tiny Rwanda (also autocratic but good on health issues) are the most-vaccinated countries in Africa.\nBy way of contrast, Nath\u00e1lia Pasternak Tashner, a Brazilian microbiologist and visiting scholar, described Brazil\u2019s top-down failure. Once a model of successful vaccination, with 90 percent acceptance rates, Brazil had its own industry and no anti-vaxx movement. That was almost single-handedly wiped out by one man: President Jair Bolsonaro, who claimed that Covid vaccines could transmit AIDS and turn people into alligators. After his health minister and some doctors began echoing him, even childhood vaccinations began sinking. Polio immunization, once near-universal there, is now at 68 percent \u2014 risking the return of even that all-but-eradicated virus.\nData Can Be Surged\nAnother element of creating trust is data \u2014 especially big, fast data.\nFor new vaccines, large trials with 50,000 participants engender trust, said Daniel Salmon, director of the Institute for Vaccine Safety at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health.\nFast data is particularly important for countering the lies of the anti-vaccine movement. When Andrew Wakefield claimed in 1998 that measles vaccine caused autism, it took 18 months to produce a single study proving him wrong. During that interim, no one could prove that his Lancet paper \u2014 now retracted \u2014 was nonsense.\nUnfortunately, the U.S. health-care system is weak at producing numbers. In Israel, citizens belong to one of four HMOs who report anonymized data to the health ministry. In Britain, the National Health Service tracks medical records. With datastreams like that, health departments can quickly spot adverse vaccine events like blood clots or Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome \u2014 and can also calculate how common such such events are in subsets of the population. For example, if you know what the background rate of myocarditis is among young healthy males, you can quickly tell whether a few well-publicized cases after vaccination are normal or something unusual and dangerous. Our fragmented American health care system makes that impossible, so we must rely on smaller datasets like military recruits or VA hospitals, which don\u2019t reflect the whole population. We have V-Safe, as Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the C.D.C. director, pointed out, but it relies on voluntary cellphone texts \u2014 not a comprehensive or objective source.\nFaced with an anti-vaccine movement prepared to exaggerate any rumor, this is a serious weakness.\n\u2018Don\u2019t Say Mandate\u2019\nOne issue I was surprised to not hear raised the entire week was vaccine mandates.\nMandates have been saving American lives since George Washington inoculated his troops against smallpox in 1777. A growing mountain of evidence shows they work. They did in 2014, when California got rid of religious and philosophical exemptions to school vaccines after a large measles outbreak that began in Disneyland; vaccination rates among first graders shot up. They worked last year for many hospital systems whose nurses resisted until they were told their jobs depended on it. They worked for New York City\u2019s public employees and for admission to New York City restaurants. They worked for United Airlines and many other employers, including even Fox News. In the end, very few resisters decided it was worth losing their jobs, high levels of immunity were achieved and there was no epidemic of adverse effects.\nAnd yet not a single public health leader all week even mentioned them. The only defender was a politician: Kyriakos Mitsotakis, the Greek prime minister. In an interview with Meg Tirrell of CNBC, he described how he turned around his country\u2019s dangerously low vaccination rate. Greece has one of the world\u2019s oldest populations but by late last year had achieved only 50 percent immunization, one of the European Union\u2019s lowest levels. As a result, it suffered high death rates in both the Delta and Omicron waves. Starting in January, Mr. Mitsotakis said, he decided to \u201cmake life difficult for the unvaccinated.\u201d The government used carrots and sticks, but with a twist: Healthy young adults aged 18 to 25 got the carrot: a payment of 150 euros (about $166) to get a shot. The elderly got the stick: resisters over age 60 were fined 50 euros in January and 100 euros a month after that. Vaccination rates quickly shot up to above the European average.\nCeding The Field\nAnother issue not even raised all week: countering the anti-vaccine movement.\nWhile many experts expressed sorrow at how effectively it had eroded trust in vaccines and how many lives that had cost, there was not a single suggestion that the medical profession actually fight back.\nNo discussion of revoking the licenses of MD\u2019s who oppose safe vaccines, tout false cures or even issue medical exemptions without seeing patients.\nNo discussion of the fact that many of the loudest anti-vaxxers are motivated by money: they sell alternatives like vitamins or ivermectin or they run clinics for \u201cvaccine-damaged\u201d children or they solicit tax-deductible donations for the \u201ccharity\u201d that pays their salary.\nNo discussion of prosecution for spreading lies that kill.\nIn 2010, the British Medical Council revoked Andrew Wakefield\u2019s license for his ethical lapses. In this country, even though more than 90 percent of all hospitalizations and deaths are of unvaccinated people \u2014 including some who have been prescribed worthless treatments, no prominent physicians have yet been disciplined. State medical boards in Oregon, Maine, Connecticut and elsewhere have moved only against a few relatively obscure practitioners.\nThe upshot? All the experts agreed that this would not be our last pandemic. Right now, I hold out little hope that there will be fewer deaths in the next.\n*Disclosure: I was paid a consulting fee by the Program in Vaccine Education of the Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons to sum up the five days of discussion and add my own thoughts, as I\u2019ve done here.\nP.S.

Clearly, Someone Did the Math for Him.\nTrump is losing hundreds of voters a day to Covid \u2014 far more than the margins in the swing states.\nMath is not Donald Trump\u2019s strong point.\nExample: In 1988, he paid $408 million for the Plaza Hotel and spent millions making it gaudier. Seven years later, his creditors sold it for $325 million. And yet he styles himself a business genius.\nGenius or no, he is suddenly doing something very smart: in interview after interview, he endorses vaccines and boosters. He\u2019s even called political rivals who refuse to admit they\u2019ve been boosted \u201cgutless.\u201d\nWhy?\nMy guess is that somebody has done the math for him.\nThe math that says: \u201cUh, sir? Your voters are dying in droves.\u201d\nDoing the math\nBy last June, almost all American adults who got vaccinated voluntarily had had their shots.\nThe Associated Press did a study of all Covid deaths in May and found that 99 percent of them were among the unvaccinated.\nSince then, many other studies have reaffirmed that trend: in September, a C.D.C. study found that 91 percent of deaths were among the unvaccinated. In November, a Texas state health department study put it at 95 percent.\nWho are the unvaccinated? Back in May, they were no doubt a mix of Republicans and Democrats. Early on, for example, many black and Hispanic Americans were hesitant about vaccines..\nBut that trend has shifted. Lots of black and Hispanic Americans came to accept the vaccines and employer mandates forced working Americans of all stripes to get them.\nRecent C.D.C. data cited by Kaiser Health News shows vaccine-resistance highest among whites. Earlier polls showed growing divisions along party and even religious lines (86 percent of Democrats vaccinated vs. 60 percent Republicans; 90 percent of atheists vs. 57 percent of white evangelicals). By September, the pattern was clear, according to David Leonhardt of The New York Times: Covid death rates were about three times higher in counties that had voted for Donald Trump in 2020.\nSince the AP did its study, about 270,000 Americans have died of Covid. If, say, 95 percent of those dead were unvaccinated, that\u2019s 257,000 unvaccinated Americans gone.\nHow many of them were Trump voters? It\u2019s impossible to know, but the Delta wave pushed average daily deaths over 1,000 a day in late August and they\u2019ve stayed there. Those battle lines were clear by September. So it\u2019s a good bet that the vast majority of deaths of the last two waves have been.\nAs of this week, about 1,800 Americans a day are dying of Covid; the C.D.C. expects that number to rise above 2,600.\nVirtually all are adults. If 95 percent were unvaccinated and we assume that 75 percent of those were Trump supporters, that\u2019s 1,300 to 1,900 of his voters being subtracted from the rolls every single day.\nDonald Trump lost Arizona by a mere 10,000 votes. He lost Georgia by 12,000, He lost Wisconsin by 21,000. He lost Nevada by 33,000.\nRight now, about 60 Arizonans, 36 Georgians, 34 Wisconsinites and 14 Nevadans are dying of Covid each day. Seventy five percent of 95 percent of that would be minus 103 Trump voters per day \u2014 just in those four swing states. Week after week. That adds up.\nAlso, there is another factor in the equation. Covid is just one cause of overall mortality. While Republican state legislatures are working hard to suppress the Democratic vote, an invisible opposing hand is working against them: God\u2019s.\nThe top five causes of death in this country, in order, are: heart disease, cancer, Covid, accidents and stroke. They all tend to smite the old, the obese and those who live far away from hospitals, i.e., rural red America.\nIt\u2019s a good bet that Donald Trump has finally seen the arithmetic on the wall. If he is to have even a prayer in 2024, he needs to slow down death rates among his supporters. Hence, the booster-backing.\nIt may be too late, of course. But it sounds like he\u2019s trying \u2014 despite the booing.", "comment_count": 33, "like_count": 1273, "created_time": 1641867888698, "comment": [{"user_id": "d58b26425136", "comment_time": 1641867888698, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "462c4cc14054", "comment_time": 1642271586380, "comment": "Darwinian Gerrymandering"}, {"user_id": "4577fb69a0da", "comment_time": 1642348312285, "comment": "Thanks for doing the math.

Maybe this could be the opening that makes vaccine passports acceptable?\nViruses spread through networks \u2014 and one of those networks is skiers.\nIt\u2019s probably too late to do anything about it. But if we\u2019re ever going to get serious about stopping the spread of viruses (as we tried to do by suspending flights from South Africa on Nov. 26), we do need to look for patterns.\nAnd maybe, just maybe, the fact that rich city slickers are spreading this one could be an incentive for the mandate-resistant parts of this country to accept vaccine passports?\n\nSkiers played a role in the initial spread of Covid-19. That\u2019s happening again with the Omicron variant.\nLook at The New York Times map of which U.S. counties are being hit hardest by Omicron right now.\nIt\u2019s easy to follow: the deeper purple the county, the higher the case count per capita. As you would expect from news reports, the whole Northeast except for Maine is deep purple. So is much of the South, and the Rust Belt as far west as Chicago.\nThere are also major urban hotspots: New Orleans, Miami, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Seattle, Houston, Dallas. This is viral spread in the jet age: Thanksgiving-Christmas travel carried the virus from airport to airport.\nThe Mountain States, however, are fairly pale. They\u2019re still waiting for the Omicron blow.\nWith one odd exception: in each mountain state, there is at least one county that is deep, deep purple. In Idaho, it\u2019s Blaine County. In Utah, it\u2019s Summit County. In Wyoming, it\u2019s Teton County. In Colorado, it\u2019s Pitkin County. In Montana, it\u2019s Gallatin County. In Oregon, it\u2019s Deschutes County.*\nWhat\u2019s the common denominator? They all contain ski resorts. Those are the homes of Sun Valley, Id.; Park City, Ut.; Jackson Hole, Wy.; Aspen, Co.; Big Sky, Mt. and Mount Bachelor, Ore.\nMoreover, some are the same counties that were ravaged in the first Covid-19 wave. In March, 2020, while New York City was getting all the attention, Sun Valley was actually a hotter hotspot. On a per capita basis, its tiny population suffered more illness and death than New York City did. Ski counties in Colorado and Utah were also hit hard.\nSkiers also played a role in the initial spread of the virus in Europe. It\u2019s not entirely clear how the virus got from China to the Alps, though there are business connections between Wuhan and the Italian city of Bergamo, Italy\u2019s hardest-hit city, which sits on the edge of the Alps. Once there, the virus spread to ski towns in the Austrian Alps and from there to Germany. Skiers may also have played an early role in its spread from Singapore to France.\nAssuming this is true, what to do about it?\nThe brutalist response would be to do what we did to South Africa: temporarily stop travel to and from ski towns. But that would cost a lot of hard-working Americans their jobs. And it\u2019s politically unthinkable. The complaints by South Africa\u2019s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, fell on deaf ears in Washington. Complaints from Mountain State governors would not; President Biden needs them.\nA better idea would be to do what resort towns in northern Italy have done in order to safely stay open this winter: If you can\u2019t prove you\u2019re vaccinated or have recently recovered from Covid or have recently tested negative for it, stay home.\nThey use the European Union\u2019s app, which resembles New York\u2019s Excelsior Pass: it displays a QR code that can be quickly scanned. In western Europe, that idea went from unthinkable to accepted late last year, just in time for Omicron. Digital health certificates, aka \u201cvaccine passports\u201d are now common in Europe and Israel as well as in China and Japan.\nThe Biden administration\u2019s rejection of vaccine passports is one of its signature failures in its Covid-19 response.\nAfter months of hesitation, it ultimately came around to imposing vaccine mandates (which are no doubt saving thousands of lives in this late Delta/early Omicron wave but getting no credit for it, including from the Supreme Court.)\nBut now this country has no forgery-resistant way for someone to prove they are vaccinated or immune \u2014 meaning no way to exclude a potential superspreader. (Yes, a vaccinated person can spread Omicron, but probably for less time and with a lower viral load.)\nWhich is too bad \u2014 because right now the red states could be using those passports to slow the import of the virus into their mountain towns. Outward spread from epicenters is inevitable, whether the virus rode in with skiers headed for Sun Valley or bikers headed to Sturgis. Rural states tend to have fewer hospitals with fewer intensive care beds and fewer options when staff members fall ill, so they will soon have yet another wave of overwhelmed hospitals, as New York City is having now.\nWhen will we learn?\n*This one-purple-county trend was very strong in the first week of January.

I\u2019m four years into advocating for my kids at school and one year into my own self-actualization journey, and I\u2019ve learned that even when you are living an autistic experience, it is impossible to perfectly understand, or hold perfect empathy, for someone else\u2019s. Nevertheless, the key not only to autism awareness, but acceptance, is to endeavor to try to understand as best we can.\nEmpathy isn\u2019t a mindset or characteristic, it\u2019s an exercise in actively seeking to understand other people\u2019s experiences. Below are tips for people who work with, live with, teach, care for, or love someone with autism who\u2019d like to grow empathy for them.\nTake it one person at a time\nThe autism advocacy community loves the Dr. Stephen Shore quote, \u201cIf you\u2019ve met one individual with autism, you\u2019ve met one individual with autism,\u201d as a way to describe the diversity of experiences around the autism spectrum. That\u2019s because, while there are common characteristics, including traits you\u2019d mostly likely be able to spot in a room full of autistic people, growing empathy for the autistic experience is best done one person at a time.\nThis doesn\u2019t mean going from autistic person to autistic person and asking them to educate you about the state of autism today, but instead to notice with an open heart and an open mind how they are responding to the world around them, including you, without any expectation of what\u2019s right, wrong, or normal.\nThe spectrum part of \u201cautism spectrum\u201d isn\u2019t referring to a severity scale, low to high, it\u2019s referring to an array, an assortment of traits experienced in different degrees by each individual. Autism also has a lot of co-morbidities relating to physical health and learning capabilities, which co-exist on their own spectrums, so the possible combinations of traits making up each person\u2019s experience is vast.\nSocial media has its issues, but one very easy way to gain understanding of individual autistic experiences is to spend some of your social media time listening to autistic creators. Hashtags like #actuallyautistic and #autisticadult will steer you toward people with firsthand experience being autistic who are sharing their stories to form connections and grow understanding. The key word here is listen.\nThink about your nervous system\nCommon characteristics for autism include sensory issues and needs, not only with the standard five senses but with things like feeling our bodies or sensing our physical presence in the world. The experience is most recognizable when your autistic friend is wearing noise canceling headphones in an otherwise quiet space, or when someone is so overstimulated they melt down. But just because you can\u2019t see their experience of hypersensitivity to bright light, for example, doesn\u2019t mean the overhead fluorescent lights in the office aren\u2019t slowly sucking the life force out of your autistic colleague.\nTo grow your empathy for this particular aspect of the autistic experience, start with considering your own nervous system:\nStart with your 5 senses \u2014 list one thing that gives you great pleasure and one thing that totally disgusts you when you see, hear, taste, smell, or touch it. Imagine or recreate those sensations.\nThink of a time when you were perfectly at ease and list all of the elements involved, the location, people, time of day, lighting, whatever strikes you as contributing to that feeling of ease. Consider how incredible it was for all of those things to align for that perfect moment.\nThink of a time when you were extremely overwhelmed and list the elements involved there. Try to put yourself back into your own emotional shoes in that experience.\nSame thing for an experience of great pleasure.\nThe next time your autistic loved one is having a major sensory experience, like big joy or deep overwhelm, connect that to the feelings you reflected on that represented your highest limit of feeling and imagine it amplified and amplified again. For example, what would it be like if the thing that currently just grosses you out instead triggered your fight or flight response?\nImagine a world where the norm is the exact opposite of what you prefer\nLately, I\u2019ve had a few different experiences with a type of person I\u2019ll call \u201cwell meaning friendly folks.\u201d Maybe you know the type, that upbeat extrovert who cannot possibly imagine someone would prefer not to talk to them, or wouldn\u2019t like a good joke or a chance to meet someone new. They tend to be people who know exactly what brings them joy and just want to share it without discrimination, and either have no clue there are people who really don\u2019t want it, or think people unlike them have something wrong with them that can be fixed with more of what they know is right to like. This mindset is often supported by the fact that what they love is regularly reported to be the norm.\nMany of us do this to some degree when it comes to our preferences, whether they\u2019re the norm or not. And many of us have experienced being made to feel weird or left out because of something we love. But for an autistic person, when the norm is a social expectation they are unable to fulfill, it can be a frustrating and isolating experience.\nTo grow empathy for differences in social experiences, try this:\nChoose an element of your social life you love or loved \u2014 a club or sport, parties, getting to know everyone on your block \u2014 or a social personality trait you\u2019re proud of or well-known for.\nImagine a world where what you love doesn\u2019t exist, is frowned upon, or your trait is considered rude or annoying, but you can\u2019t help but do it anyway.\nThink of how you\u2019d be treated, the ways you might try to hide or adapt your now weird way of being, imagine knowing that the norm is never going to change.\nBe open to adapting your style\nIt\u2019s easy to fall back on the idea that you are who you are and it is what it is. Or, to believe that you are making things better by helping an autistic person learn how to be more \u201cnormal\u201d or toughen up or learn to get along. But believe me when I say most of the rest of the world is already working extra hard at fitting your autistic loved one into a very uncomfortable, often harmful, box. The expectation is most often for the autistic person to adapt in order to make everyone else more comfortable. Research has shown this kind of masking can have seriously detrimental effects.\nTo grow empathy and relieve the stress of autistic masking, be open to adapting your way of doing things to match theirs. That might mean using more direct language, hanging out together but doing different things, or making their safe foods without making a fuss about it. If you\u2019ve been paying attention to their experiences, you\u2019ll know just what to do.\nIf you\u2019ve made it to the end of this article, thank you. It often feels like the greatest risk factor for autistic people is misunderstanding, something we can easily resolve if more people like you were interested in learning how to try.\nLiza Dube is an autistic mom of an autistic kid and certified emotional intelligence coach.

From data and coding for a cause to design and storytelling for a widget, there\u2019s a lot going on behind the marketing scenes. But even with all that variation, marketing has always been based on the same goal \u2014 getting people to do stuff. Repeatedly, if possible. And while there have always been people willing to use underhanded tactics to achieve that goal, savvy marketers know that brand loyalty today takes real relationship building. Enter emotional intelligence.\nEmotional intelligence, the ability to use information about your own and others\u2019 emotions in order to manage yourself and relationships, is a critical skill set for anyone in the corporate world, not to mention the world at large. But marketing professionals need it for more than just getting along with each other.\nUnderstanding Your Audience\n20 years ago, audience understanding meant learning about and embracing your ideal consumer\u2019s behavior before, during and after the moment they may or may not choose your product or service. With the rise of social media, marketing professionals had to figure out a whole new kind of behavior as they were designing the media for that behavior. Now, marketers need to know all of that and be able to develop even more authentic emotional bonds with consumers relating not only to their products, but the state of the world itself.\nAccording to the Havas 2021 Meaningful Brands Report, \u201cDespite growing cynicism, our expectations of brands are at an all-time high, creating a significant expectation gap. 73% of global respondents believe brands must act now for the good of society and the planet, preferring to buy from companies with a reputation for purpose as well as profit.\u201d\nDeveloping and effectively using audience personas takes more than great data (although, yes please to great data, always). Empathy, communication, and self-awareness are table stakes for really getting into the mind of your target audience and then designing products and experiences they\u2019ll respond to in a way that meets complex emotional needs.\nGetting Along With Each Other\nMarketing is complicated. Even a one person business needs a multiple person team to execute a basic digital marketing strategy. Getting everyone on the same page requires its own kind of emotional intelligence. Matching different skills, personalities, experiences, and motivations to a single goal based on a person not necessarily like anyone on the team is some fine-tuned leadership.\nThen, of course, there\u2019s also just getting along with other people at work, not necessarily for the purpose of efficiency or productivity, but just because it makes work better. Happy, excited, challenged, and entertained marketing professionals make things more fun for everyone.\nBeing the Best at Internal Marketing\nPeople expect marketers to be the best at marketing under all circumstances. The most creative. The most persuasive. The best at getting people to do stuff. That includes getting funding from the boss, getting the IT team on board, and getting the company rallied behind the next big plan. What a lot of marketers don\u2019t realize is that even when everyone is in a budget meeting asking for more money, expectations are higher for them to perform with ease.\nThis kind of emotional intelligence is a combination of the other two \u2014 understanding your internal audience, and figuring out how to persuade them to give you what you need while still getting along. It\u2019s the ultimate in interpersonal workplace politics, and marketers are expected to be better at it than anyone else. Whether this is actually true depends on the marketer, however, and how well they understand how to use their emotional intelligence skills.\nThere\u2019s no one way to learn or use emotional intelligence as a marketing team because every team is made up of a unique combination of people with their own unique strengths. When I train marketing teams to use emotional intelligence more strategically, we look at that combination of strengths and focus on leaning into them when possible. Identifying challenges in a team\u2019s ability to reach their goals usually comes down, not to a lack of a particular marketing skill, but to interpersonal issues. By focusing on emotional intelligence as a core skill for marketing professionals, everyone\u2019s unique skills have more room to shine.\nThis article originally appeared on LizaDube.com", "comment_count": 1, "like_count": 2, "created_time": 1647349942271, "comment": [{"user_id": "4beec9fb06d5", "comment_time": 1647349942271, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "3bcdfec92529", "comment_time": 1647384916343, "comment": "Some great points, thanks for sharing!"}], "post_tag": ["Marketing", "Emotional Intelligence", "Leadership Development", "Corporate Culture", "Authenticity"]}, {"author": "Liza Dube", "post_id": "b6d123e9a730", "user_id": "4beec9fb06d5", "title": "Lessons From Two Years As An Entrepreneur", "content": "Lessons From Two Years As An Entrepreneur\nPhoto by Christina @ wocintechchat.com on Unsplash\nWhen I decided to work for myself, I\u2019d just been laid off, was recovering from a traumatic divorce, and had just moved to a new state as a single mom. A few weeks later, the world closed down in the midst of a global pandemic. Which is to say it was chaotic. The only preparation I\u2019d done was a decade of dreaming about dropping out of corporate life forever. I had no plans, just confidence in what I had to offer and an interesting network, so I started there.\nStudies show that 20% of businesses no longer exist after the first year, 30% after the second. That\u2019s a lot of baby businesses still plugging away out there. The lessons I learned my first year, things like finding support and figuring out how to manage my time, were such valuable fundamentals, I share them with my clients now. In year two, however, things got a little more nuanced.\nBuild the business you want to run\nAround this time last year, I realized I\u2019d tried a lot of different types of coaching and consulting business building \u2014 group and hybrid offers for scale, digital ads, courses, productizing \u2014 and there were things I knew I didn\u2019t want to do or be after all that trying. This was phenomenally helpful in figuring out what to do next. I made a list titled \u201cThings I\u2019m Not\u201d and posted it on my office wall. Whenever I felt myself getting lured into the sparkly promises of gurus who figured out The Way To Do Business, I\u2019d check the list, and that was usually enough to bring me back into focus.\nHaving a great idea for a business is one thing, understanding what it will take to get it up and running and make it sustainable without totally hating it is another. And one person\u2019s dream process is just as likely to be another\u2019s nightmare. I\u2019ve worked and networked with quite a few early stage entrepreneurs these past two years, and having a few abandoned products and strategies in those first couple of years was a reassuring theme. Sometimes you have to try something out to realize you hate it and never want to do, or even think about it, ever again.\nIt\u2019s okay to break and heal while you build\nAll that learning while doing takes nerves of steel and the kind of humility you might not expect from a person with enough gumption to start a business in the first place. But being willing to lose money, to fail spectacularly, to boldly declare to everyone you know you\u2019re about to try something unpredictable isn\u2019t easy. And for a lot of people, working for themselves is as much about getting away from some bad stuff as it is building a dream. Breaking down and burning out can happen.\nThe first couple of months of my second year, I was so burned out from years of major life changes and a toxic workplace followed by a year of pandemic business launching, I stopped almost everything. I had a couple of clients booked, I was working with a consultant on a product idea, I wrote the occasional social media post and took a few calls and that was it. There was neither hustle nor grind. A more appropriate description might be a shuffle with the occasional lurch.\nResilience isn\u2019t usually earned the easy way, instead it\u2019s lessons learned through hard times. Burning out helped me with that \u201cThings I\u2019m Not\u201d list I mentioned earlier. And that helped me understand what I really wanted to spend my precious energy on. And that helped me start to heal.\nThere are as many versions of success as there are people trying for it\nI work with everyone from corporate senior leaders to multi-passionate creatives because I am or have been those, and many other things, in my career. And every person I\u2019ve had the pleasure of working with has had a different vision of success. It\u2019s not just creating a business to sell for millions or scale to serve thousands or grow to staff hundreds. It might be starting a business to pay for fun stuff, or become famous, or transition into a new industry, or make the most of a talent. Making money is always part of it, but almost never the only part and in every vision of success I\u2019ve seen so far, the non-money parts are always unique.\nAnd then there\u2019s what\u2019s actually available for success at any given time. When I\u2019m career coaching, I talk about what I call The Venn Diagram of Hireability. There\u2019s what you can do, what you want to do, and what there\u2019s a market for. Success usually comes along when those three things are uniquely in balance for each of us.\nI\u2019ve heard rumors that the third year is when things really start clicking. And while I do have my eye on a few interesting things on the horizon, I can honestly say that making it through two years, these two years in particular, is an accomplishment I will always treasure. It could all change tomorrow and I\u2019d always feel like I succeeded.\nThis article was originally published on LizaDube.com", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 1, "created_time": 1646163109804, "comment": [], "post_tag": []}, {"author": "Michael Beausoleil", "post_id": "53a4e3646ff4", "user_id": "e7722387355b", "title": "California\u2019s Making Toy Stores Gender-Free, and It Makes Sense", "content": "California\u2019s Making Toy Stores Gender-Free, and It Makes Sense\nGrowing up in the 90s was a simpler time. If you went to McDonald\u2019s you didn\u2019t have to worry about choosing a toy for your Happy Meal. The employee would ask \u201cboy or girl.\u201d Answering with the former would get you a Hot Wheels car and the latter would get you a mini Barbie Doll. Now, the employee asks \u201cBarbie or Hot Wheels?\u201d Children are burdened with the task of choosing.\nHot Wheels or Barbie via McDonalds\nWhile this seems like a small and simple transition, McDonald\u2019s is actually the biggest toy distributor in the world. When they make changes, it\u2019s usually a result of a large number of complaints. This means other toy distributors are likely impacted by the same issue McDonald\u2019s faces, but their messaging is less overt. Rather than asking children to ask for a \u201cboy\u201d toy or a \u201cgirl\u201d toy, retailers divided stores into sections for boys and girls.\nIn California, this is about to change. Gov. Newsom signed a mandate requiring large toy stores (defined by 500 employees or more) to have a section for gender-neutral toys. This means places like Walmart and Target will need to have aisles that are not classified for boys or girls. Likely, this will have implications for toy stores and distributors nationally. Marketing, packaging, and retail layouts will need to change to accommodate modern social movements.\nAs California deems this change necessary, the toy industry will need to adapt. The simple transition seems to have significant implications, and it reaches into many sectors of life.\nWhy Is A Genderless Toy Section Necessary?\nIn California, advocates in the LGBTQ+ community want to prevent kids from being forced into traditional gender norms. Children often view the world through a simpler lens, and they may feel misgendered because they receive a pink or blue toy. This can be psychologically confusing and distressing, even though the color of the item has no impact on its functional use.\nTarget Toy Section via passionatepennypincher\nGendering toys can also prevent children from using certain items. While there are some impacts from boys playing with dolls and girls playing with cars, they\u2019re not the negative implications many people believe. Exposure to a large number of toys can help children develop a greater number of skills. Sticking to traditionally gendered toys could prevent boys from developing compassion and girls from learning technical skills. It\u2019s unclear if toddler play habits have any link to eventual sexual orientation and gender identities. At best, the correlation is loose and needs much more study. However, it is clear that parents who interfere with children\u2019s natural play preferences can instill shame and resentment in their children.\nThe California mandate also extends to other items marketed toward children. Products like toothbrushes, soaps, or sunscreens will be marketed as gender-neutral because there\u2019s no difference in product usability. This is an issue that persists into adulthood when women pay a \u201cpink tax\u201d for products. The sensation describes the up-charge for feminized items that are equal or inferior to the same product marketed toward males. So, teaching children to view hygiene products as genderless can save them money later in life.\nIn many cases, gendering products is an attempt for companies to squeeze more money out of parents. When a parent has one child, there\u2019s a decent chance that another is coming. Gendering products would encourage parents to buy more items. If the older child is a girl and the younger is a boy, they\u2019d need to replace items simply for cosmetic reasons. Over time, these standards have become universally accepted. It means parents buy different items for each child during holidays, and companies can change prices based on color schemes.\nGendering toys has been a huge part of American culture. It\u2019s influenced our language: the term action figure was introduced because boys wouldn\u2019t play with dolls. In the short-term, companies can make more money. Now, we\u2019re actually studying long-term impacts, and they\u2019re not worth the cost.\nWho Benefits From Gender-Neutral Toys?\nThe call for gender-free toys isn\u2019t necessarily a call to strip all toys of gender. Our society is heavily influenced by gender, and children see this. So, Disney will continue to produce princess dolls and they\u2019ll still appear to be feminine. The issues fall into two major concerns. Firstly, many toys are assigned a gender when there\u2019s no need. For example, a game of checkers does not need to be placed in the \u201cboys\u201d section. Secondly, children should not be shamed for their selection of toys because this can be developmentally harmful. As a boy growing up, I was receiving advertisements for a \u201cQueasy Bake Oven.\u201d A regular Easy-Bake Oven was too feminine, so I needed to bake gummy worms into my cake.\nGender-free toys. Via kidadl\nAll of this messaging can be confusing for children who just want to play. If a girl wants to play with a dollhouse, it\u2019s fine. It\u2019s an issue for a boy, unless he builds that house out of Legos. Suddenly, this becomes a masculine activity.\nNow, retailers are realizing this is an issue. In 2015, Target started to make some of the aisles in the toy section gender-neutral. They acknowledged that some of the signage was unnecessary and exclusionary. There\u2019s no reason to make one gender feel unnecessarily unwelcome in parts of their store. Yes, this is an alleged response to customer complaints, but Target is also able to benefit. More children will become interested in Legos if they\u2019re all welcome to look at the selection. Likely, Target will be able to benefit from selling more Legos because they\u2019re really expensive.\nChildren will appreciate the freedom to play with toys based on their preferences. Retailers can benefit from selling toys to double the audience, but they need to appeal to parents as well. After all, the parents are ultimately the ones who make the purchases. Many parents recognize that gendering toys is unnecessary, but other parents aren\u2019t ready to accept the changes. This generation has been heavily influenced by gendered products, and they will continue to buy items based on their personal preferences. California has opted to put mandates into effect, but other states like Texas will resist this movement. At least, they\u2019ll give the businesses the power to display merchandise without government regulation.\nRetailers should have no real reason to oppose the changes. This might be an example of profits overlapping with progress. All they need to do is allow more young, impressionable eyes on their toys.\nAre Toy Stores Becoming Genderless?\nIn 2019, Mattel introduced a line of \u201cCreatable World\u201d dolls. The dolls themselves did not have a gender assigned to them. Children were able to dress the dolls as they pleased, and there were plenty of masculine and feminine clothes available. Mattel introduced this line in addition to Barbie Dolls, and now children had more options.\nvia Mattel\nThis is akin to the changes in the toy section. Boys and girls will continue to have their own sections, but the gender-neutral section will also exist. So, parents don\u2019t need to worry about their sons accidentally stumbling across a Barbie. She\u2019ll still be in a different aisle.\nCalifornia\u2019s law will exist because toys are unnecessarily gendered. We all know the world is still heavily divided by gender, and children will see this on a daily basis. So, children will still find wrestling action figures in the \u201cboys\u201d section. TV ratings will tell us that WWE has a male-dominated audience (though many females watch as well), so this influences the promotion and sales of their toys.\nThe mandate in California will require Target to do what they\u2019ve voluntarily done for the past 6 years. They will sell the same products to boys and girls because gender isn\u2019t a factor in those sales. So, Play-Doh will be sold in a section devoid of gender. Both boys and girls use Play-Doh, and there\u2019s no reason to keep it in the \u201cgirls\u201d section; even if the Doh is pink.\nIf the closure of Toys R Us has told us anything, toy stores were already in trouble before California proposed a genderless section. If the state wants to create a more inclusive environment, the stores will adapt. Children will quickly understand that they\u2019re able to play with gender-free toys and they won\u2019t have a hard time navigating these changes. We\u2019re far more likely to see parents take issue with these changes. Children will go into the store, get their toys, and move on with their lives.", "comment_count": 3, "like_count": 134, "created_time": 1634533436927, "comment": [{"user_id": "e7722387355b", "comment_time": 1634533436927, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "b9e5393eccb4", "comment_time": 1639973245659, "comment": "This is something that benefits all kids, not just transgender ones.

What\u2019s going on?\nI\u2019m starting to hear an echo across many of the channels I subscribe to on YouTube. There\u2019s a level of frustration because creators are still putting in the effort, but viewership seems to be going down.\n\nI\u2019ve listened to a number of upset YouTubers, and you have to wonder if people stopped caring about their videos rather than the platform as a whole. Then, you look at other forms of media like music videos and movie previews and it seems to confirm viewership has decreased.\nEven if you\u2019re not a creator, you need to wonder what\u2019s happened. Is YouTube losing its steam, or is there another explanation behind the decline?\nAre People Really Leaving YouTube?\nAs of 2022, the number of YouTube users in the US hovers around 200 million. This is an increase from prior years, and the number is expected to grow. So it really doesn\u2019t seem people are abandoning the platform.\nNumber of YouTube viewers in the United States from 2018 to 2022, estimating 210 million in 2022. Via Statista\nIn fact, YouTube Premium has also been growing. In 2021, the platform reported having 50 million subscribers, an increase of 20 million from the prior year. This is an important sign of growth because it demonstrates that users aren\u2019t just giving time, they\u2019re spending money. So it will attract future creators and allow the existing ones to dip into the potential earnings.\nWith the demonstrated increases in viewership, YouTube is also observing how people watch content. It\u2019s actually one of the platforms that isn\u2019t exclusively looking at mobile devices for growth. YouTube is now a source of TV content, and more people are streaming videos on their televisions than ever before.\nMost subjective data suggests YouTube is getting bigger and that will continue. For every minute YouTube exists, hundreds of hours of content are uploaded. Numbers tell us the platform is growing, so why does it feel like it\u2019s shrinking?\nWhat\u2019s Happening At YouTube?\nIn 2016, Adele\u2019s Hello music video amassed a billion views in 87 days. The song was a huge hit, but YouTube played an important role in its rise. In 2022, Easy On Me was Adele\u2019s big comeback. Both songs spent 10 weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100, yet Easy On Me isn\u2019t anywhere near a billion views. In March 2022, about five months after its release, the song only has 260 million views.\n\nOf course, Adele is just one example, and she doesn\u2019t prove anything. Her viewer count is a worldwide tally, so her success in the US only means so much. But when her views decrease while other creators are complaining about a decline, something must be happening.\nBut there is a possibility that YouTube can become more popular and creators are seeing a decline in viewership. This means the platform is shifting directions, and creators will need to adapt if they want to be successful.\nVideos Are Getting Longer\nObjectively, this is the simplest explanation and it would make the most mathematical sense. More viewers on the platform, but view counts are getting lower. If the video length is increasing, this means people will consume fewer videos in a period of time.\nOnce upon a time, YouTube didn\u2019t allow users to upload videos longer than 10 minutes. That boundary was pushed until it was completely removed. As a result, the average length of a video increased each year, particularly after 2014. As that number increases, people are going to start watching lengthier clips, but consume fewer.\nAdd this to the fact that YouTube is pushing live streams and hosts movies, and there\u2019s potential for viewers to spend hours on the platform but only contribute one view.\nYouTube Is Promoting TV Streaming\nNo, YouTube is not transforming into a traditional television network, but it wants to keep those networks off of your screens. More TVs have the ability to stream YouTube than ever before, and the platform is going to reward creators who can be viewed in the living room.\nYouTubeTV on a TV. Via WhatToWatch\nIt\u2019s clear that YouTube wants to be connected to your TV. In March 2022 the service obtained the rights to stream ad-supported TV shows, akin to Tubi TV. But YouTube is different than Tubi because it offers more than just ad-supported shows. By teasing viewers with real TV, they\u2019re hoping these people will become paid subscribers to a service like YouTube TV.\nClearly, these paid options aren\u2019t designed to help vloggers and home-grown channels. While YouTube couldn\u2019t exist without its core content creators, it also can\u2019t grow without revenue coming in. Now, more styles of content will be promoted, and the algorithm is going to favor content that aligns with its future goals. Long-form content and high-quality videos are going to be treated favorably, and that also means some channels will feel the impact of shifting objectives.\nViewers Want Other Content\nAt its core, social media algorithms promote content that\u2019s engaging and will get views. YouTube started as a user-centric video upload site and that attracted a lot of vloggers, and those are the creators I have followed for years. If they\u2019re not getting views, it likely means they haven\u2019t uploaded content that resonated with the new generation of viewers.\nIf we look at the trending videos on YouTube, we\u2019ll often find some clips from talk shows and a decent number of pranks, but the most common videos fall into the gaming genre. Younger audiences seem to be into reaction-style videos and live stream content. If you\u2019re just vlogging and living life, you\u2019re not likely to get views from young viewers.\nMaking YouTube videos is easier than ever. You don\u2019t need any equipment beyond a smartphone, and there are lots of options out there. The market is very saturated, so creators need to differentiate themselves. New channels are likely to start their YouTube journey with a niche in mind while preexisting channels will need to pivot and rebrand if they want new audiences.\nIs YouTube Really Losing Views?\nIf you look strictly at the public-facing numbers, it\u2019s hard to deny that channels are losing views. Music videos for some of our biggest songs are only receiving a fraction of the views an equivalent song would receive in 2017.\nBut this might also be a case where we need to compare apples to oranges; the videos that were popular five years ago aren\u2019t as popular in 2022. The methods of obtaining content are also changing. People still stream music, but they might not be using YouTube. Like most digital trends, creators will either need to adapt or get left behind.\n\nIf you hear a creator complain about losing viewership, they\u2019re most likely not being dramatic. Older viewers are likely moving on and newer viewers aren\u2019t as interested. People who don\u2019t adapt to the changing landscape will struggle to find success in a new climate.\nThis doesn\u2019t mean YouTube is dead or people don\u2019t care about it. In fact, the platform is offering more than ever. The number of options has made it impossible for viewers to consume everything they want to watch, so some things won\u2019t get viewed.

When you have dollars, more people start crawling into your life: everyone from Uncle Sam to your old college friend to a representative calling from Citi Bank with an exclusive promotion. In those moments, you start to realize that having some money can translate to problems.\n\nFrom \u201cMo Money Mo Problems\u201d via Bad Boy Records & Arista Records\nMoney problems aren\u2019t reserved for the rich, in fact, they might be more impactful when you have modest savings. So you\u2019re not a bad person for feeling financial pressure as you make more money. It\u2019s normal, and being aware of these risks can keep you from losing the money you\u2019ve earned.\n1. Your Income Is Getting Taxed\n\nI would tell anyone to have taxes withheld from their income, even from a young age, even if they only anticipate receiving a couple of thousand dollars a year. Of course, everyone knows their income is going to be taxed (unless you live in one of the states that don\u2019t tax their income), but reality hits you in the face when you watch your paycheck dwindle.\nBut we all know taxes are inevitable, so why is this such a problem? Well, now budgeting becomes a game. The amount your company says you\u2019ll receive, your actual salary, isn\u2019t what gets deposited into the bank. When you factor in taxes, insurance, and retirement savings, it can feel like you only see half of the money you earn. This makes every attempt to take your money more frustrating and painful.\n2. You Need to Determine How to Invest\nCongratulations, you\u2019ve covered all of your necessities. Now, you have a little bit of money left over. While there\u2019s the temptation to spend it, there\u2019s also an angel on your shoulder encouraging you to save it. Likely, you\u2019ve heard to invest your money because it can earn interest and hopefully allow you to retire one day. So you need to come up with a plan, and the burden likely falls on your own shoulders.\nIf you\u2019re lucky your company will have a 401K or some type of retirement plan, and that can be an easy choice for investing, especially if there\u2019s employee match. If you\u2019re left to make your own decisions, the number of options can be very intimidating. You can look at \u201chigh\u201d yield savings accounts, stocks, or trendy cryptocurrency. Usually, the safest routes take a lot of time to see the reward, but the ones promising the fastest reward tend to have the highest risk.\n3. Businesses Start To Target You\n\nAs you get older, your lifestyle begins to change and you fall into stereotypes of adulthood. This can include buying a home, having control over your finances, or owning a car. Once you prove you can make these types of moves, you\u2019ve also proven you\u2019re a suitable customer. One day you\u2019ll get your mail and realize you\u2019re digging through credit card advertisements and fliers for home security systems.\nIn one regard, this should be a badge of honor; companies know you\u2019re valuable. More than that, it\u2019s just annoying. Solicitations are getting really crafty, and under the pile of pre-approvals and ads, you have real bills to pay and documents to sign. If you overlook one thing, you\u2019ll be at fault, not \u201cSleeptight Home Security.\u201d\n4. You Suddenly Have More Friends\nThere\u2019s an idea that when you have a lot of money, you suddenly get super popular. This might be true if you win the lottery or star in a movie, but the average Joe won\u2019t be so cool. However, you will start getting invitations to go out more. Not because you\u2019re more interesting or people like you more; it\u2019s because you can pay the bill. People want to go out with others who can afford to participate in activities, and if you\u2019re paying your share, you\u2019ll become a suitable guest.\nNow, you need to make decisions that will either impact your savings or your relationships. As you get older and take on more responsibilities, your life becomes an endless list of decisions. This means you\u2019ll need to prioritize your personal wellbeing or you\u2019ll need to decline some fun activities so you can focus on long-term goals. Eventually, these decisions will benefit you, but in the moment they can be quite painful.\n5. You Can\u2019t Maintain Your Lifestyle\nOnce you have a constant stream of money, you\u2019re going to want to improve the quality of your life. It\u2019s hard to keep working and never take advantage of your earnings, but you need to pace yourself. Before you double the size of your apartment or upgrade to a smartphone, make sure you can sustain this lifestyle.\nOf course, you can\u2019t deny yourself of everything, but it gets very expensive to keep up with trends. This will slow your progress when saving for a big expense, and it will be very damaging if you lose your income. At that point, you won\u2019t just lose your upgraded quality of life, you\u2019ll also need to compromise or accrue debt to get necessities.\n6. Time Becomes More Valuable\n\nWhen you\u2019re young, it feels like you can spend your days pursuing hobbies or just lounging around. Now, those boring days sound like a dream, and a lot of your time is used to earn money or acquire skills. Conceivably, your time now has a price on it. When people tell you to wait or waste your time, it can feel like they\u2019re devaluing you as a person.\nAlternately, this might be one of the areas where you decide to splurge. Saving yourself some time can be worth an upgraded cost while wasting time can be an expensive decision. This can improve the quality of your life when you learn to decline events you won\u2019t enjoy or bypass hassles with premium experiences. It also becomes painful when people feel they\u2019re the center of the universe and your time isn\u2019t important.\nSome Problems Are Good Problems\nYou might not be broke, in fact, some people would say you\u2019re doing well. This doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re immune to money problems. Once you start to have a little bit in your savings, you need to protect it. So, you\u2019re going to encounter some complications along the way.\nThis also proves you\u2019re a work in progress, but you\u2019re progressing in the right direction. In many regards, the start of your career and financial growth can be the most painful time. You\u2019re making a lot of changes, and it can take a lot of effort to keep moving in the right direction.\nWhen you see someone coming after your money or your success, pat yourself in the back. Then, keep working to improve your financial situation. Recognize that any type of progress comes with its own set of problems. When you gain wealth, you absorb some money problems, but it also gives you some power; it\u2019s your responsibility to use this power to keep growing rather than party it away.", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 0, "created_time": 1646023734108, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Money", "Saving", "Finance", "Personal Finance", "Personal Development"]}, {"author": "Michael Beausoleil", "post_id": "f9652617d9df", "user_id": "e7722387355b", "title": "When We Where Young: Will It Be Fyre Festival 2.0?", "content": "When We Were Young: Will It Be Fyre Festival 2.0?\nWhen I was young, I had an iPod filled with music by Avril Lavigne, Paramore, My Chemical Romance, and other \u201cemo\u201d acts. My music taste has changed (at least a little bit) since then, but I\u2019d be lying if I said I didn\u2019t return to these songs every so often. Clearly, I fall into the prime demographic for the When We Were Young Festival.\nWhen the line-up was announced, I have to admit I was impressed. Almost all of my favorite emo and pop-punk acts were on the roster, and I could see them for a single ticket. It was like putting my iPod on shuffle, except it\u2019s a real festival.\nWell, the festival is real, right? While many emo fans were super excited, a lot of people approached the event with skepticism. When the band All American Rejects posted a tweet saying \u201cApparently we\u2019re playing with ALL the bands\u2026\u201d people viewed the message as proof of deception and disorganization, bringing memories of the infamous Fyre Festival.\nScreenshot of The All-American Reject\u2019s tweet.\nAre we being duped into another Fyre Fest? Or are we ready for a rockin\u2019 trip down memory lane equipped with guyliner and skater shoes?\nWhen We Were Young: Fyre Festival 2.0?\nDespite some concerns, it seems very unlikely this festival will be a rerun of the Fyre disaster. There are too many artists and companies behind the project to make it such a catastrophic failure. But this doesn\u2019t mean it will be a homerun success. In fact, there\u2019s a possibility this festival has its own issues to deal with.\nThe Artists Have Spoken About It\nCheck out the headliners, people like Avril Lavigne and My Chemical Romance have promoted the show on their Instagram pages, while Bring Me the Horizon and Paramore have spoken about the show on Twitter. Despite what All American Rejects have alluded to, artists are invested in the show.\nAvril Lavigne posting about When We Were Young\nThe Fyre Festival did have some big names on their roster, like Blink 182, Migos, and Major Lazer. The line-up was smaller, but some of the artists pulled out of the show hours before they were set to perform. In theNetflix documentary \u201cFYRE: The Greatest Party That Never Happened,\u201d Blink 182 only backed out because they felt they wouldn\u2019t have suitable resources to perform.\nIf artists want to get out of When We Were Young, it\u2019s not going to be as easy. The show has organizations behind it with more authority than Ja Rule.\nLive Nation\nIgnore all the artists who are named on the poster, the most legitimate name associated with WWWY is Live Nation. Unlike Fyre, this isn\u2019t just some experiment, it\u2019s a major opportunity for the company. Concerts have been struggling, and Live Nation hasn\u2019t had a good experience with the shows that have happened.\nLive Nation\u2019s promo\nLive Nation also works with Ticketmaster, which is a reputable ticket brand. While this doesn\u2019t necessarily speak to the legitimacy of the WWWY festival, it does instill some confidence in ticket buyers. The company takes a stance on fraud and allows individuals to resell tickets. So people might be paying an up-charge if a show sold out, but at least they know the tickets are real.\nAbove all else, Live Nation needs a success, and this is an opportunity to shine. The company was attached to the Astroworld tragedy, leaving people to question their ability to handle major concerts and festivals. WWWY might be their best chance to demonstrate their ability to run a safe festival. Let\u2019s be honest, the target demographic for this festival is probably decade older than Travis Scott\u2019s shows.\nWith Live Nation supporting the show, WWWY is in fairly capable hands; certainly much more competent than Fyre Fest\u2019s organization.\nIt\u2019s Las Vegas\nWWWY takes place at the Las Vegas Festival Grounds. It\u2019s a known venue for large gatherings like the iHeart Music Festival. Fyre Fest took place on a remote, private island in the Bahamas. Organizers had to build the accommodations, venues, and stages. In Vegas, that stuff mostly exists already.\nTents at the Fyre Festival. Photo via Splash News and GQ\nWhen organizers pulled the plug on Fyre Fest, attendees struggled to find a way out. WWWY is in Vegas, and there are plenty of places to stay. Sure, there are some places where people would rather not stay, but it\u2019s a very different destination than an \u201cexclusive\u201d island in the Bahamas. If you\u2019re stuck in Vegas, there are tons of fun places to explore and no shortage of hotels with reasonable accommodations.\nSo What\u2019s the Worst That Could Happen?\nAs of February 2022, all signs point to the show happening. That doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t potential obstacles, especially in our current health climate. Many concerts have been canceled or postponed, but it seems venues are starting to adapt. Recently, Coachella and Stagecoach dropped all COVID-related precautions. Attendees won\u2019t need to be vaccinated, they won\u2019t need a negative test, nor will masks be required. If you\u2019re going to the show, you\u2019ve assumed the risk.\nThis will give WWWY a blueprint to follow, or an example of what not to do. Health guidance is still pending, and it\u2019s scheduled to be released in September, 2022. However, attendees have already been warned that they\u2019re assuming risks when the go to the show.\nMost likely, the show will go on if the health climate remains fairly stable. We\u2019re also at the point where organizers have accepted the likelihood of COVID\u2019s presence at the show. Artists and employees have to follow health protocols, meaning some people could get sick and there\u2019s a good chance some acts will drop out of the show.\nPromo for Adele\u2019s show at Caesars Palace via Radar\nBut you never know. Adele allegedly postponed her residency because of pandemic-related issues. Things can happen, and there will be hurdles to overcome. Organizing a show in modern times is going to have many variables that humans can\u2019t control, but this isn\u2019t going to be the disaster we saw at the Fyre Festival.\nThe worst case scenario would be canceling the show due to the pandemic. In this case, Ticketmaster might need to issue refunds. Money will be lost, but people aren\u2019t going to be stranded without basic necessities. It\u2019s Vegas; not always ideal, but leaps and bounds better than the Fyre disaster. But Live Nation has too much to lose. They\u2019ll fight to prevent the worst case by any means necessary.", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 1, "created_time": 1644115185555, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Music", "Festivals", "Business", "Marketing", "Rock"]}, {"author": "Benjamin Davies", "post_id": "eec2b3b1782e", "user_id": "d4132ba487a", "title": "5 overused phrases that make me irrationally annoyed", "content": "5 overused phrases that make me irrationally annoyed\nAs a UX Writer, I spend a lot of my time experimenting with voice and tone in writing.\nOften, when I\u2019m tasked with writing copy for a specific user flow, I\u2019ll also be sent across brand guidelines, copywriting style guides and examples of text from the marketing team. This all helps give me a clear idea of the voice, and the brand\u2019s unique personality that should shine through in all contexts whether marketing or deep within the user journey.\nThis is different from the tone. If the voice is the personality, the tone is the mood. For example, if I\u2019m writing an error message, I imagine the user would feel frustrated. Depending on the context for the error, choosing a playful tone might just annoy them further and give them a negative impression of your product (unless you\u2019re Slack, in which case if my error message isn\u2019t playful, I\u2019m going to be feeling all kinds of disappointed). A more serious and direct tone might be more appropriate.\nWhat does this have to do with 5 phrases that I find annoying? Well, overused phrases become clich\u00e9s, and the more users read them, the less of an impact they have.\nA lot of the time, such overused words become overused in the first place because they are excellent at conveying a specific voice. But when it goes too far? I\u2019d argue that they have the opposite effect. Rather than injecting your copy with personality, they can make it sound weak and familiar, meaning your voice is lost (hence my ramble about what voice means at the beginning).\nAnd for more highly-strung users who have the patience of a tired toddler on a sugar-free detox like me, they can elicit reactions of disproportionate annoyance, increased blood pressure, and a lot of general huffing and puffing. (Yes, this is a disclaimer that this list is based on my personal opinion, and also I tend to be a smidge dramatic when it comes to reacting to words).\nAnd another disclaimer \u2014 I\u2019m not stating which companies my examples are from in most cases, nor am I out to shame these companies. Every writer and company has examples of overused language, so it\u2019s purely to illustrate contexts.\nWithout further ado, here are some words that I feel like I\u2019ve been seeing a lot everywhere and read as clich\u00e9s in my mind. I\u2019d love to hear any phrases you\u2019ve had the same reaction to!\nSOMETHING SOMETHING VIBES \u2728\ud83c\udf43\ud83c\udf1f\ud83e\udd1e\nLet\u2019s kick off by me thoroughly showing my age. What even actually is a vibe? Why do I automatically say \u201cthank you\u201d when people send me vibes on WhatsApp? Do vibes contain calories? Can a vibe be a bad thing? Are vibes deeply ironic and only taken seriously by a minority of vibe-less individuals?\nI prefer my vibes shaken, lightly salted, and caffeinated tbh.\nI lied. I\u2019m not a stranger to vibes. I have been known on occasion to send strangers on Twitter good vibes when they say nice things about my Medium posts, for example. However, \u201cvibes\u201d are bloody everywhere.\nI had a look on Google Trends to see if it\u2019s possible to pinpoint the start of the \u201cvibes\u201d movement, and it seems possible:\nShout out to all those vibing in 2004, OGs.\nI\u2019m not sure what happened in 2015 that caused the upward spike (indeed nothing good at all seems to have happened in 2015\u2026), but vibes have been around long before, and the meaning has remained consistent.\nThe examples above are all taken from emails from a range of brands ranging from work to lifestyle and groceries, and in each case, it\u2019s clear \u201cvibes\u201d is a more playful and arguably slightly more tangible way of expressing some sort of feeling.\nBut when you think about it, what\u2019s being expressed here? It\u2019s something hard to express. However, \u201cvibes\u201d feels like a cop-out. If your desired voice is \u201cvague\u201d, then by all means go for it, but it\u2019s time to try putting those feelings in other words.\nOtherwise, in 10 years, we\u2019re going to have entirely replaced all feelings of any kind with the word vibes, and that\u2019s going to go like this:\nGot some new shoes today, total new shoe vibes. But it\u2019s raining outside, rainy day vibes. Maybe I\u2019ll just stay home tonight and get a Dominos, pricey pizza vibes for rainy evening vibes. Oh, and I need to try and fix my toilet later, send plumbing vibes. And can you believe it someone just tried to call me who even does that anymore Vodafone vibes am I right.\nI also enjoy this take on \u201cvibes\u201d, written shortly after the 2015 \u201cvibes\u201d boom.\nNO EMPLOYEES, JUST ROCKSTARS \ud83c\udfb8\nYes, this is a bandwagon, and I am jumping on board because I keep seeing \u201crockstar\u201d everywhere. It began with start-ups and tech companies over-using it in job descriptions.\nAt some point, someone decided that \u201crockstar\u201d is an acceptable synonym for \u201cthe best\u201d, thus \u201chiring the best\u201d became \u201chiring rockstars\u201d, and \u201cwe need someone very talented to join our company and we can\u2019t pay that much but you need to eat, sleep, live, breathe and sneeze our brand\u201d became \u201cwe need a rockstar\u201d.\nAnd then it started bleeding out of job ads into general job vocabulary. Here are some headlines from professional publications and job posts (and yes, I didn\u2019t blank out \u201cInternwise\u201d as a company in that second because it\u2019s worryingly common to label unpaid internships as \u201crockstar\u201d positions and that is absolutely not OK. In fact, bad vibes to any company labelling unpaid internships as \u201crockstars\u201d).\nWhat if I\u2019m more of a pop star singer-songwriter than a rockstar \ud83d\ude22\nFrom an employee branding perspective, \u201crockstar\u201d was probably intended to make positions sound more exciting. And the trouble is, if your position needs words like \u201crockstar\u201d to sound more exciting, it sounds insincere. And if it sounds insincere, you lose credibility and end up putting off professionals who may otherwise have been interested.\nWords like \u201crockstar\u201d and its cousins \u201cninja\u201d and \u201chacker\u201d may be putting off whole groups of people, i.e. women and minority groups.\nFor job titles, surely the title is enough, and for other cases, why do we need to go beyond \u201cbetter than good, rockstar levels of good\u201d.\nIn my past job as a Product Manager, I remember listening to a talk from some other PMs talking about how to be a Product Rockstar, describing some vague set of soft skills that wouldn\u2019t traditionally be associated with rockstars, at least not in my opinion.\nWhat do you think of when you hear \u201crockstar\u201d? For me, I think of Tina Turner. Icon, but I don\u2019t see her particularly enjoying the process of prioritising a backlog in Jira with over 2000 tickets, some inexplicably dating back to before Jira was even a thing.\nFor some companies, \u201crockstar\u201d has become a word for an idealised employee, fitting their own definitions, e.g.\nYou regularly sell out large arenas to people who pay to listen to your music and then trash a hotel room after.\nWhy not consider how you want to come across as a company, and focus on descriptions that are sincere, authentic, and not potentially offputting to more than 60% of the population? And in case you\u2019re interested, read more on the issue with \u201crockstar\u201d in job adverts specifically here.\nWHERE? AT YOUR FINGERTIPS \ud83d\udc50\nFull transparency: this phrase made the list when I realised I had used it several many times in one flow for a client. Searching around, I realised it\u2019s become pretty ubiquitous, especially in marketing comms.\nIs it just me or is the word \u201cfingertips\u201d starting to make you uncomfortable?\nThere\u2019s something unsettlingly physical about the phrase \u201cat your fingertips\u201d, but it might be my personal propensity to take language very literally. What\u2019s at my fingertips right now? My credit report, apparently. And the world\u2019s best dishes. And the world of music, radio and podcasts. And EVERYTHING. *hyperventilates*\nWhen I went back to edit the text I had written, I realised I defaulted to \u201cat your fingertips\u201d whenever I wanted to describe how easy something was, or what opportunities it would afford the user, and it had become a crutch for making these things simple to write about. It\u2019s not always easy to articulate the true value to the user behind something, but just like with \u201cvibes\u201d, \u201cat your fingertips\u201d starts to be vague.\nAnd more than that, it seems to often be used in combination with other classic clich\u00e9s, such as in the last example shown above. \u201cEverything\u2019s all in one place, at your fingertips.\u201d Normally, I would just scan through this and not really read this, as it\u2019s familiar and clich\u00e9d, but reading in detail, is this not the same sentiment repeated twice?\nIn tHeSe UnPreceDeNted TiMes\nYes, Covid-19 was world-changing and perspective-shifting and generally traumatic. Was it unprecedented? There are arguments on both sides. Some say no, as humanity has experienced pandemics before, such as the Spanish Flu pandemic at the beginning of the 20th century. Some say yes because the context for this pandemic is a world in which there\u2019s more mobility and a higher proportion of people living in urban areas.\nRegardless, one thing was a certainty in 2020 \u2014 that you\u2019d read the word \u201cunprecedented\u201d at least 23 times a day.\nI need someone to make a Chrome extension that replaced the word \u201cunprecedented\u201d with the word \u201csh*t\u201d.\nCertainly in 2020, things were unprecedented. And especially in an email situation, it felt odd to say the cursory \u201cI hope you\u2019re keeping well\u201d without specifying \u201cin these unprecedented times\u201d because it felt like you were ignoring the sky basically falling and society collapsing.\nAnd while there have certainly been a bunch of other terrible unprecedented world events since 2020, we need to stop and ask:\nIn a time where everything is unprecedented, is anything actually therefore truly unprecedented?\nWhereas before, \u201cunprecedented\u201d because part of the vocabulary of writing with an empathetic and aware voice, it has quickly fallen into the realm of clich\u00e9.\nGOTTA HUSTLE\nCome closer, because I need to tell you something and I don\u2019t want others to hear. OK, I\u2019m going to whisper this.\n2 years ago, I started a side-hustle. I started moonlighting and spending every evening after work consulting as a Product Manager and UX Writer. And then last year, I quit my 9\u20135 and made my 5\u20139 my new 9\u20135, and my side-hustle became my main hustle.\nWhat\u2019s alarming to me now is the sheer amount of times I read this exact thing from others every single day, and how suddenly everyone a) needs to have a side hustle and make it massively successful and earn 6 figures from it and b) is writing about side hustles as a side hustle (my brain hurts).\nIf you say \u201chustle\u201d ten times in a row, it stops sounding like a real word.\nWhen did everything suddenly become a hustle? Back in the day, I sweat hustle used to mean swindling people out of money or doing something a little illicit and shady. Suddenly, it feels like anything you do outside of your main source of income is a hustle.\nI read this article about the true meaning of hustle, and it was a bit of an \u201caha\u201d moment. Kirstyn LaRee says:\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to call it what it is \u2014 a business.\u201d\nNow tone-wise, I think people (coughGaryVcough) started talking about \u201chustling\u201d because it sounds exciting. Something different, not ordinary, something you put passion into, something you put energy into for a big payoff at some point.\nHowever, with the amount we talk about hustling nowadays, it\u2019s become a pressured thing. I mean, in the examples above, watercolour painting is conflated with hustling. It\u2019s gone too far, and it\u2019s all too pressured.\n\u201cHobby\u201d, \u201cpassion project\u201d, \u201cconsulting\u201d, \u201cfreelance work\u201d, or even \u201cside business\u201d may not sound quite as sexy or energetic, and lack that same feeling of movement as is implied by the word \u201chustle\u201d, but they\u2019re much more accurate, less pressured, and don\u2019t run the risk of carrying the same negative connotations as \u201chustle\u201d.\nWhich clich\u00e9d phrases get your blood boiling?\nThis is my list, and writing this was also a reminder to myself to try and avoid relying on buzzwords and clich\u00e9s in writing or to add personality to text.

Any game-obsessed teen who poured countless hours into the Sims in the early 2000s has probably heard this phrase countless times. It\u2019s how the Sims greet each other \u2014 and is one of the few Simlish phrases to have a set meaning.\nOne of my favourite parts of the Sims was always the way they spoke. In between avoiding kitchen fires, spine-chilling burglaries and failing to keep my Sim kids out of military school, I imagined whole personalities for my sims based on their utterances. Sometimes they would sound exasperated, so I\u2019d let them watch TV (what a benevolent teenager-with-a-god-complex I was). At other times, they\u2019d suddenly sound flirty mid-conversation, and a few interactions later would be getting married.\nHowever, Simlish was \u2014 and still is in the current Sims 4 iteration of the game\u2013nonsense. So I decided to take a little nostalgic dive into the Simlish language and consider what impact it has on the overall UX of the Sims.\nWhat is Simlish?\nSource. Her voice is\u2026 an acquired taste?\nLet\u2019s zoom out briefly and mention what Simlish actually is. Simlish is the official language of the Sims Nation. And by language, we mean gibberish.\nCreator of the Sims Will Wright considered several different possibilities for how Sims should speak, and we\u2019ll look into why he chose Simlish in detail from a UX perspective in a moment. While there\u2019s no official confirmation anywhere that Simlish at least draws inspiration from any real language, some think that they can hear traces of Filipino, Irish, Navajo and Ukrainian. In fact, we know that Will Wright experimented with Sims speaking some of these languages directly, so it\u2019s possible that sounds from each made it into Simlish.\nFor the original Sims, voice actors Stephen Kearin and Gerri Lawlor improvised all Simlish sounds, playing with intonation and tone and yes, making up a lot of the language on the spot.\nI remember thinking that Simlish sounded like Dutch, that was until I heard Dutch actually being spoken. Some of my friends reckoned it was some sort of corrupted English, but there are a lot of sounds in Simlish that don\u2019t exist in English. Check out this video if you want to hear what \u201ccorrupted English\u201d could sound like.\n\nFor comparison, here\u2019s Katy Perry recording \u201cLast Friday Night\u201d in Simlish, because apparently, Simlish is a niche genre of pop music:\n\nQuite different, wouldn\u2019t you agree?\nSimlish masks repetition in the game experience\nWhen I tell you I probably spent 500 hours playing the Sims, I\u2019m probably severely underestimating. And I\u2019m sure if you played the original Sims on a Windows 95 machine too, you\u2019ll know that\u2019s no mean feat due to the game glitching out and the frame rate dropping to 2 (frames per minute, not per second).\nAt its core, Sims is simple. You build a house, tell your sims to cook meals, go to work, and use the toilet, they ignore you and instead set fire to themselves. While there are a ton of possibilities when it comes to ways of building or paths your sims can take, there\u2019s a tonne of repetition.\nYou know what would make this repetition even more apparent? If every time your Sim was hungry, you heard them complain \u201cOI I AM HUNGRY FEED ME\u201d. Or if every time they\u2019re about to wet themselves, they scream \u201cI HATE YOU FOR MAKING ME, AN ADULT SIM, WET MYSELF THIS IS DEGRADING.\u201d\nRepetition gets a bad rap in the gaming world, and for good reason. It\u2019s boring. no one wants to spend hours doing the same thing over and over without variation without much payoff. However, as with any product, games come with a learning curve.\nIn the Sims, you need to learn how to take care of your Sims, how to balance competing needs at once, and how to make sure they don\u2019t accidentally starve to death. You learn this by living the same day over and over, doing the same actions until you learn that it\u2019s quicker to cook certain meals than others, meaning your Sim is more likely to get to work on time. Or that the best time of day to instruct your Sim to shower is after work because before work they\u2019ll need to prioritise fulfilling their hunger need. Repetition is valuable because it helps you learn how to succeed in the game.\nWhile there are multiple ways to mask repetition and make it enjoyable for users (check out this article for some excellent examples), one way is to infuse the experience with surprise.\nIn my opinion, Simlish does exactly this. You see, if the same phrases in English were used, Sims talking would quickly feel repetitive and boring. However, Will Wright found that using a made-up language made it harder for gamers to recognise any patterns in speech, meaning that each time your Sim exclaims something in gibberish, it feels new and fresh.\nAnd on the off chance that you do happen to spot any repetitions in Simlish? Well, then you feel like one of the Sims. Hello, total immersion!\nSimlish gives gamers the scope to create their own narratives\nMore than 2 decades after the release of the original Sims, it\u2019s obvious why it\u2019s so beloved as a gaming franchise. Yet when Will Wright first came up with the idea, it was met with scepticism.\nThe Sims was born from SimCity, which is a city-building simulator. Much like the Sims though, SimCity is about giving players the freedom to do what they want and build in whichever way takes their fancy. There\u2019s no defined end goal, and no way to definitively win the game. That\u2019s up to each player\u2019s interpretation. For me, success meant building a massive city and then having fun destroying it with tornadoes. (Don\u2019t judge \u2014 I know you used to remove the pool ladders in the sims. We\u2019re the same.)\nA game without a definite way to win was a pretty controversial idea back then in the 80s, and it took a while for Wright to find investors.\nWhen players were able to get their hands on simulation games though, it was clear that part of the appeal was coming up with their own narratives. From a psychological standpoint, we humans love nothing more than crafting a good old narrative from just about anything. Why? It helps us make sense of the world, exercise our imaginations, think through hypothetical scenarios and consider consequences. (I recommend this paper as an intro if you want to dive into the topic a little deeper.)\nAt its core, Sims lets players partake in exactly these things. And in newer versions of the Sims, there\u2019s an unimaginable range of options, so no two Sims will ever likely have the same narrative. But how does this relate to Simlish?\nWell, Simlish being nonsense, you can interpret it however you want. If my Sim has just gotten home from work and utters something, I might think \u201cSHE\u2019S EXHAUSTED\u201d and tell her to go watch TV to unwind. Someone else might think \u201cSHE WANTS TO GO ADOPT SEVERAL PUPPIES\u201d and go off to the pet shop. Simlish plays into the ability for players to craft their own narratives for their play, which would be lost if any real language were used.\nSource. Regardless of how you interpret this, we\u2019re all that woman with the coffee in the background giving him the side-eye.\nGoing beyond just the sounds, Simlish is often represented visually in the games with random symbols in speech bubbles. If your Sim has an urgent need or is disturbed by something (like a fire or another Sim singing badly on a stage), the symbol carries an obvious meaning. In other cases, such as the maths thing in the screenshot above, it\u2019s completely random and also up for interpretation.\nPlus, these visual cues make Simlish accessible to those with hearing impairments. Or those who play with the sound off because they forgot their headphones and they\u2019re meant to be working but they\u2019re writing about the Sims instead. (Remember, inclusive design such as this helps everyone, say it with me.)\nSimlish solves localisation complexities\nI have a background in localisation, so I\u2019ll be the first to tell you how essential it is for any context. I\u2019ll also be the first to tell you that it can be expensive and difficult to do well.\nOne of Will Wright\u2019s reasons for choosing Simlish was that it wouldn\u2019t need to be localised. In picking a gibberish-based language, he would avoid needing to localise the speech of the Sims, which would be expensive and technically tricky.\nThis also interestingly means that players of Sims in different languages have the language of the Sims in common with one another, which is pretty unique \u2014 in which other contexts could that ever be the case?! Whether you\u2019re an English, Ukrainian or Manadarin native, Sims sound the same, which makes the whole world of the Sims feel that much more inclusive and immersive.\nI think in part that\u2019s due to the relationship between language and culture. To quote Dr Angela Carpenter, a teacher of the foundations of language creation at Wellesley College, \u201cLanguage exists in a culture, but at the same time, they\u2019re inventing a culture.\u201d For example, in Japanese, there are multiple different forms of verbs used to convey politeness and formality that can indicate whether someone is superior or not, or a peer, reinforcing the culture of politeness, formality and deference to superiors in a range of situations.\nThe world of the Sims is colourful, eccentric and at times, absurd, so a language comprised entirely of wildly intonated gibberish is therefore not only suitable but reinforces the in-game culture.\nIn conclusion, *mutters gibberish*\nWhile on the surface, Simlish is mildly amusing, there\u2019s a lot of thought behind its implementation in the Sims series, and it undeniably strengthens the gameplay and is one of the reasons the Sims are so beloved.\nCheck out this video to learn more about how Simlish was created, and just for fun, here\u2019s another pop song in Simlish courtesy of Lily Allen:\nYena fwuupa sweeeeeeeeeee *deletes pool ladders*\nUntil next time, sul-sul!", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 50, "created_time": 1650033025387, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["UX", "Games", "The Sims", "Product Management", "Design"]}, {"author": "Benjamin Davies", "post_id": "6500a2f295ca", "user_id": "d4132ba487a", "title": "Fancy a drink? A UXer\u2019s first impression of 5 dating apps\u2026", "content": "Fancy a drink? A UXer\u2019s first impression of 5 dating apps\u2026\n(Yes, the title made me cringe too.)\nLet\u2019s start with a couple of disclaimers\u2026\nFirstly, is this clickbait? No. Today, I was talking with some Product Marketing colleagues about messaging and first impressions and was looking through the app store for some inspiration. After all, around half of visitors to your app store page make the decision to download based on their first impression. So that\u2019s why I decided to share a couple of \u201cfirst impression\u201d reactions to some app store pages.\nIn this context, \u201cfirst impression\u201d encompasses a couple of things \u2014 the title and name of an app, the logo, the first few screenshots, and maybe also the review count and star rating. This excludes things like the description and complete set of screenshots, anything that requires scrolling to see.\nSecondly, why should this interest UX folk? I\u2019m interested in what we can learn from these first impressions. After all, if you\u2019ve got just a few seconds to make a good first impression, you\u2019ll have put a lot of thought into the way you\u2019re presenting your app.\nPlus, this is all part of the user journey \u2014 and it can\u2019t continue unless they decide to download, so it\u2019s essential to understand and optimise. (Check out this as a nifty little intro for the subject of \u201capp store optimisation\u201d if you want to learn more).\nThirdly, I think it\u2019s always interesting to look at different contexts and types of apps. While I\u2019m not the target user for these apps (#matesnotdates), I\u2019m interested in seeing what I can learn. Plus, unlike a lot of apps, anyone looking to download a dating app already has a clear use case in mind.\nSo, let\u2019s get to dating on the Play Store (yes, on browser, not on mobile, because I want to see more at once)! (Cringe)\nThe classic: Tinder\nMore like \u201cMatch. Awkwardly wait for the other one to message. Give up hope.\u201d\nI did try out Tinder when I was at university. (And as a closet homosexual in a very small university town with about 3 potential matches within a 100km radius, I can\u2019t say I had much success.) Back then, it was new and exciting \u2014 and it seems to still be the leading dating app.\nAs for my first impression? I was struck by the simplicity of how it looks. No fussy background colours, simplified UI snapshots of the app, and just three words to read on the screens, all backing up the title which states that Tinder is \u201cDating Made Easy\u201d.\nWith the simplified UI in the screenshots, the focus is firmly on the core of the app: the people! We have the full-screen photo of Amanda on screen 1, an example of a match and conversation on screen two, and then more matches and conversations, which gives me confidence that there\u2019s a good range of people to be met here.\nNow, the headline \u201cMatch. Chat. Date.\u201d puts me in two minds. On the one hand, it presents the whole user journey in the most simple terms possible. I know what actions I\u2019ll take as a user to get that \u201cDate\u201d outcome. Plus, seeing \u201cMatch\u201d here made me suddenly realise that it\u2019s called \u201cTinder\u201d in the first place as a play on the word \u201cMatch\u201d meaning one thing in dating and also a stick you set fire to, hence the flame logo. (Maybe I was just slow on the uptake there?)\nOn the other hand, I\u2019ve seen this \u201c3 basic verbs\u201d type of phrase in a lot of places, especially in the app store. Compressing the journey into three words does back up that \u201ceasy\u201d claim in my mind. However, it could sound overly simplified and frank.\nIn terms of a first impression? There\u2019s such a little amount of text here that I can passively read it all, meaning I don\u2019t need to squint and spend any time or effort on reading headlines. Indeed, if it gets to the stage where I\u2019m actively reading, we\u2019re beyond the first impression stage.\nThe disrupter: Thursday\nThey\u2019re going to do a dating app just for \u201cHackney\u201d next.\nI\u2019ve seen Thursday a lot on LinkedIn recently. They\u2019re doing a stellar job when it comes to employer branding, as there has been a LOT of chatter about how fun and different they are. It fits \u2014 they\u2019re here to change the dating game, so they\u2019re going to need to be a disruptive team to accomplish that. However, I didn\u2019t look too much into them, so I didn\u2019t know what the concept was.\nIs the concept clear to me from my first impression? Yes. I mean, the name \u201cThursday\u201d is a strong hint, but then I see the first headline \u201cThe day for dating\u201d, and I get that this is about going on dates on Thursday. (I\u2019m unsure why the logo is a \u201cU\u201d, though? It gives me upside down Udemy\nAside from the concept, the colours then immediately give me \u201ccool alternative vibes\u201d. Super pale pink and black seem like an unconventional combination for a dating app, so I instantly think \u201cah, this is for cool kids\u201d (followed by \u201cso not for me, I\u2019m not cool enough\u201d, but as I mentioned, I\u2019m not here for dating. I\u2019m here to learn \ud83d\udc85).\nThis is then backed up by the pictures on the second screen, presented as polaroids. Because cool people take polaroids, obvs. However, this is where my first impression goes from \u201cis this for dating?\u201d to \u201cis this for partying?\u201d. The photos look like drinks and clubs, but not what I\u2019d associate with dating necessarily.\nAnd as for the other components? There\u2019s a little too much going on here for me to take in everything in that initial second. To take a lesson from Tinder, there could be an addition to the app name to give more info there, and the headlines could be more concise to make it possible to passively read, as there\u2019s a lot of text here.\nHowever, the text does then give more background on the app. And I appreciate how in the third screenshot, there\u2019s that line \u201cI just want to meet someone in a bar\u201d which mirrors exactly what their ideal user might be thinking at this stage. Cleverly, it\u2019s in a different hand-written style font, just to emphasise that this is what I am thinking.\nThe professional: Bumble\nWhere the bees at?\nI am familiar with Bumble \u2014 I tried it out when I moved to London to meet people, so I can\u2019t give a true first impression.\nHowever, as a previous user, I instantly think \u201cWhere have the bees gone?\u201d (And then I think \u201cWere there even bees to begin with?\u201d, followed by \u201cI could really go for some honey on toast now\u201d.)\nBumble takes a similar approach here to Tinder, showing very simple versions of their UI and placing focus on the people shown, and their title makes it clear that this isn\u2019t just for dating.\nOne thing I particularly like here is their headlines. Unlike Tinder, there\u2019s more text to read, although the headlines are still short and easy to digest. However, to make it even easier to take in the main points, they\u2019ve highlighted the core value props in black, making them instantly stand out. So when I look, I instantly see \u201creal people\u201d, \u201cright matches\u201d, \u201cfirst move\u201d and \u201c24 hours\u201d without needing to scroll.\nWhat does that remind you of? That\u2019s right \u2014 Tinder with their simplified user journey. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve got here, with a little more complexity given the \u201c24 hours\u201d part of the concept, but it\u2019s very clear and wonderfully concise.\nThe you-already-know-what-we\u2019re-about: Grindr\nI am screaming at the \u201cTalk flirty to me?\u201d followed by the 6-second audio message.\nYes, I have used Grindr, and yes I didn\u2019t have the best time there. However, everyone knows what Grindr is really about, so it\u2019s not surprising that the word \u201cDate\u201d is missing entirely from this listing.\nFirst impression? I\u2019m reminded of Tinder again \u2014 simple one tone background, simplified UI, and three words. Simple! I suspect this is a case of apps in the industry emulating the most successful one to get a piece of the action, but it\u2019s not surprising when you think they\u2019re presenting all the info you need in as clear a way as possible to give you the right first impression.\nI\u2019m struck here by the language used. Like Bumble and Tinder, the simplified UI shown shows off the people, but \u201cBrowse\u201d as that first action I see makes me think \u201cWow, THAT many people\u201d.\nThe spooky: Boo\nBoo the ghost is too cute for me to write anything sarcastic here about, sorry.\nI\u2019d never heard of \u201cBoo\u201d before, but instantly as an introvert, I was drawn to the shy little ghost.\nMy first impression? To be honest, there was a little too much here for me to take in at once, so my eye went to the third screen with the little ghosts at the top \u2014 I would love to see the little mascot featured more.\nIn common with most of the other listings we\u2019ve looked at, they\u2019ve simplified the UI, and it looks very clean and simple. One thing that did catch my eye was the Korean line of text from the chat here, and I thought initially the screens hadn\u2019t been localised. When I looked closer, I noticed this was done on purpose though to show off the fact that Boo has an international user base.\nFor the headlines, they\u2019ve got a classic technique with the most important information in bold, with supplementary info underneath, but in most cases, I don\u2019t think the additional text is needed. Reducing would make it quicker to comprehend here, though I do like the \u201cMeet like-minded souls\u201d line from the first screen, relating back to the ghost in a cheeky subtle way.\nOne thing to mention is just to be aware of the fact that screenshots do cut off \u2014 depending on your mobile device, you might only see the first 2 and a half screens, or 3 and a half on a desktop as is the case for me in the screenshot, so it makes sense to have an impactful word or something that can be understood easily alone.\nYou can see in the screenshot, I can see \u201cX-Ra\u2013\u201d on the half of the fourth screen that\u2019s visible without scrolling. In the context of a dating app, that\u2019s probably not what you\u2019d want me to see and come to my own judgement on, especially if it\u2019s off-brand (hey Grindr \ud83e\udd2d no judgement). It actually says \u201cX-Ray Vision into the soul\u201d, so a little more innocent than I thought, but not necessarily any less confusing. I am intrigued.\nWhat can we learn?\nTo sum up then, here\u2019s what I learned:\nLess text can be more effective. If you can sum up the user journey in a few words, it will be easier and quicker to understand and potentially make a user\u2019s first impression more accurate. Plus, don\u2019t write what you can show.\nSimplify the interface where you\u2019re using it to show your app. This could apply to anywhere in the user journey, including carousels to explain how things work, and FAQs \u2014 not just the app store. Show what needs to be shown and avoid cluttering the screen with unnecessary information.\nSimple backgrounds for the win. I didn\u2019t focus on this so much but notice the lack of gradients or patterns in all of the screenshot backgrounds? Helps when you don\u2019t want your first impression to be sensory overload.\nAnd if you want to learn more, check out this piece on making the most of app store visuals to make a good first impression.", "comment_count": 1, "like_count": 2, "created_time": 1649089486032, "comment": [{"user_id": "d4132ba487a", "comment_time": 1649089486032, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "90f225e5a36f", "comment_time": 1649171509957, "comment": "maybe for the \"u\" in Thursday?"}], "post_tag": ["UX", "Marketing", "Product Management", "Apps", "Messaging"]}, {"author": "Benjamin Davies", "post_id": "b3c29d52063", "user_id": "d4132ba487a", "title": "5 cool examples of social proof in action", "content": "5 great examples of social proof in action\nWhenever I\u2019m looking for a new app to download, there\u2019s one thing that instantly impacts my decision before I even look at the screenshots: the star ratings.

In the app store, the reviews from others and whether or not they think the app is worth it help me decide whether or not to also try out the app.\nCountless experiments and examples have proven the power of social proof in marketing and UX contexts, from long lines outside Apple shops on the day a new iPhone is released to McDonald\u2019s boasting that they\u2019d sold over a hundred million hamburgers on billboard ads in 1958 (check out this article for more on these examples and lots more)\nHere, I want to share a couple of cool examples from the world of UX that I\u2019ve come across recently\u2026\nThe classic: testimonials as social proof from Gener8\nGener8 is a browser that allows users to accumulate points for any data they share while on the internet, exchanging these for rewards in a marketplace. It made quite a splash recently on the British version of Dragon\u2019s Den, getting investment from 4 out of 5 investors and being branded as \u201cthe best pitch ever\u201d. It\u2019s not just the idea that resonates, however \u2014 social proof has been leveraged throughout the onboarding experience to allay any fears that the concept is too good to be true and nudge users to download.\nBe like Andy, Elizabeth, Isabella AND Eloisa and download!\nOn their homepage, we can see three testimonials from individuals describing how they successfully exchanged points for rewards. The first testimonial even starts with the line \u201cI was initially sceptical of Gener8\u201d, which matches my thoughts as a potential new user precisely, so it\u2019s been chosen to specifically reassure me that this is the real deal.\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that these reviews come with a location and a picture, even adding the surname initial, just to add an extra layer of credibility. This helps the reviews come across as genuine, as of course, it would be easy to fake positive feedback. (And if you do fake positive feedback as social proof? Well, your users will realise their false impression was wrong and won\u2019t trust your brand, so don\u2019t do it.)\nWhile testimonials and reviews are a tried-and-true classic when it comes to providing social proof, there\u2019s another little detail on this page. See it? In the bottom left-hand corner, there\u2019s a little notification informing me that Eloisa from Southwark signed up an hour ago. As I spend longer on the page, I see more pop-ups with more people, never repeating. This doesn\u2019t just show me that others are making the decision to download, but it creates a sense of FOMO, nudging me to decide without being too aggressive.\nThe community: you\u2019re not learning alone with Duolingo\nOne of the best parts of Duolingo is how many people use it. It\u2019s one thing to be well known as a learning brand, but another when so many people you mention Duolingo to have their own stupid sentence story from that time they tried to learn Dutch with Duolingo four years ago when they went on a date with that woman from Rotterdam. Duolingo doesn\u2019t keep its community hidden.\n(If you have read my other articles on Duolingo, yes, I am obsessed.)\nThis is the screen from the sign-up process where you choose your language, and not only do you see the impressive selection available, but you see how many people are learning each. It\u2019s impressive that even the smallest and newest languages like Esperanto and Navajo have nearly 300k learners.\nFor me as a user, this helps Duolingo come across as more credible. If so many people are learning these languages, surely they can\u2019t be wrong? It also highlights that whichever language I pick, I won\u2019t be alone \u2014 and for me as a language nerd, tempts me to learn languages I\u2019d never previously considered (hello Klingon), purely because it\u2019s astonishing how many hundreds of thousands are learning them.\nThe collective impact: planting a forest with Ecosia\nEcosia is a not-for-profit search engine that dedicates all of its profits to climate-saving action, with over 80% going towards planting trees. While you browse, you can see a counter of how many trees your searches have resulted in being planted, immediately showing you that you\u2019re doing good while doing something you do every day \u2014 surfing the internet.\nSo\u2026 let\u2019s go for a billion by the end of the year?\nThis is similar to Duolingo, but rather than focusing on the number of users, the social proof here comes from the size of the impact the current userbase has had. In case I had any doubts about whether or not Ecosia does result in trees being replanted, this huge number is reassuring (someone would have noticed if 150 million trees had not been planted surely).\nPlus, even if I think before downloading my individual contribution will be small, I can see that the sum of all individual contributions is impressive, even if I don\u2019t know how many users are responsible for this.\nThe effect? I am very eager to install the extension and contribute. Then I can proudly say I contributed 3 trees to this impressive total.\nThe partners: check out what3words\u2019 existing partnerships\nwhat3words aims to make it simple to describe and share any location on the planet using a unique combination of just 3 words, accurate to a square measuring 3m x 3m. Less \u201clet\u2019s meet at the tree next to the bench down the path from the overflowing bin where there\u2019s the group of teenagers drinking Red Bull\u201d, more \u201cI\u2019m at ///scuba.clip.fired\u201d. It has been integrated into other products including cars, emergency services and logistics.\nYes, they listed their own app first. Priorities.\nThis is more social proof in a B2B context. Rather than specify the number of integrations, they let the integrations speak for themselves, listing them on this catalogue-style page. And the screenshot doesn\u2019t quite show you the scale \u2014 there are hundreds.\nFor any company potentially interested in integrating with what3words, there are two lines of social proof going on here. The first relates to the use case. You can filter by use case with the pills at the top, and this already shows you that there is (or isn\u2019t) an existing partnership in your vertical. Secondly, and most obviously, you can then see just how many companies have already done the integration, and learn more about how each of these works.\nIf you\u2019re not so familiar with the concept or not sure how integration might work from a B2B perspective, you\u2019ve then been provided with proof of exactly that. Arguably listing hundreds of examples may mean a lot of people simply go and have a scroll, maybe noticing a couple of familiar companies, but even seeing the volume of partners listed is reassuring.\nWord-of-mouth gone wild: too many users for Clubhouse?\nDoes anyone remember February 2021 when everyone was speaking with Clubhouse it was almost annoying, but at the same time, it made you desperate to get a coveted referral and see what the hype was about? (Unless you\u2019re an Android user, in which case sucks to be you.)\nSocial Proof + Exclusivity = TOO MANY USERS \ud83e\udd2d\nThe way Clubhouse used social proof is hard to manufacture: it came in the form of word-of-mouth. And this came from their exclusive invites system. To join, you needed to be invited. Once you were on, you\u2019d get 2 invites, and be prompted to share them as shown above with anyone who\u2019d be a \u201cgreat potential addition to Clubhouse\u201d. It felt highly exclusive, and although ultimately it was easy to get an invite due to the sheer volume of people joining, it still made you feel special.\nAnd that meant one thing: everyone talking about it. People who had joined told others what Clubhouse was like. And because it was exclusive, they often painted a rosy picture of exciting audio discussions with industry experts, something magical and unattainable to those outside of it (might be exaggerating this here, but it did feel like this at the time). Plus, there were discussions about who they would refer.\nFor anyone on the outside, there was speculation about what Clubhouse was like and talk of who to ask for connections. If social proof encompasses the power others can have on influencing our decisions to do something or try out a product, Clubhouse achieved this and then some.\nThe downside? They were a little too successful with acquiring users. Over 10 million by the end of February 2021. And they were unable to keep up with updating the app with desperately needed discovery and search functionalities. Oh, and the Android app wasn't released until months later. Check out this article for more insights, it\u2019s a fascinating case study.\nMore examples?\nShare any examples you\u2019ve come across recently in the comments, and check out these articles for more inspiration and background on social proof in marketing and UX:\nFor more background: Social Proof: What It Is, Why It Works, and How to Use It\nFor marketing: The Psychology of Marketing: 18 Ways to Use Social Proof to Boost Your Results\nAnd for UX: How to design a social proof user experience", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 8, "created_time": 1648489755151, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["UX", "Marketing", "Product Management", "Behaviour", "Design"]}, {"author": "Anne-Marie Slaughter", "post_id": "643b44782e09", "user_id": "7ed247f6c763", "title": "On Sparrows and the War in Ukraine", "content": "On Sparrows and the War in Ukraine\nPhoto: Mathew Schwartz / Unsplash\nThe song sparrows are back. They fall into the category that birders call \u201clittle brown jobs\u201d: small birds that are mostly brown and seemingly indistinguishable from one another, especially moving fast through leaves or grasses. In fact, the song sparrow has a very distinguishable dark spot in the center of its chest; it is one of the easiest sparrows to identify. And as you might expect from its name, its song lifts the heart. It captures the joy of a spring or summer morning in the grasslands \u2014 perched near the top of a long stem in a meadow trilling away. It is also one of the first birds to come back in the spring, at least where I live in New Jersey. In mid-March, I suddenly hear the song outside my window and know that the season is turning at last.\nThe deeper reason that I love the song sparrow, however, is that becoming a birder is in part learning to care about sparrows \u2014 a genus that is nothing but \u201clittle brown jobs\u201d and is the second most populous in the world. When I am watching one, I often reflect on the ways in which birding has taught me to look more closely and find beauty in unexpected places. The handsome brown and buff stripes on the head, the delicate dark streaks on the side of the breast, the dark feathers that neatly outline the throat and always make me think of a drooping 19th century mustache.\nThe sparrow also occupies a place in religious and secular iconography that is in inverse relationship to its size and ubiquity. Many of us can quote some version of a Biblical verse that says \u201cnot a sparrow falls but God notices.\u201d The actual verse, from Matthew, is rather less poetic. The meaning, however, is the same: that an omniscient and omnipotent being pays as much attention to the least of us as to the most: the richest, the most important, the most powerful. The gospel hymn \u201cHis Eye Is on the Sparrow\u201d captures the sentiment and the joy it can bring (click on the link to hear Whitney Houston\u2019s version):\nI sing because I\u2019m happy;\nI sing because I\u2019m free;\nFor His Eye, his eye is on the sparrow,\nAnd I know, I know He watches over me.\nAll of which brings me to the war in Ukraine. At one level, we are back in the 20th century, worrying about nuclear war between superpowers. Or indeed in the 19th century, in which great powers all had spheres of influence in which they could essentially do what they liked (James Monroe established the Monroe Doctrine with regard to the entire Western Hemisphere in 1823, when the United States was not yet 50 years old). All the pronouncements about the reinvigoration of NATO and the return of the \u201cfree world\u201d versus the autocracies focus us once again on great power politics as the currency of international relations.\nYet we live in a world in which we can see every single house on earth through Google maps or an official satellite feed. In which every one of the 6 or 7 billion people on earth who own a smartphone, depending on your calculation, can photograph and text about what is happening to them on the ground. In which global businesses can inflict as much economic pain on Russia as government policies, based on their own revulsion, or that of their employees or stockholders, at Russian aggression and deliberate targeting of civilians. In which the plight of millions of refugees and internally displaced people is as vivid to us as the bombing of buildings and the tread of tanks.\nIn short, where once we watched a war by marking the advance of armies marked with pins on a map, today we can see the toll of each bomb and shell on individual families. The killing of a child, the separation of loved ones who will not see one another again, the conflagration of a house \u2014 all of these things have always happened in war, but we could not see them except in snapshots from war correspondents traveling with armies. Yet each person, each family, each community has its story, stories that we cannot and should not bury in the abstractions of \u201cRussia versus Ukraine,\u201d \u201cthe West versus Russia,\u201d or \u201ccombat deaths versus civilian deaths.\u201d These people and their stories are the sparrows of the world.\nAs weapons stall, President Biden and other leaders are individualizing the conflict, focusing on the accountability of one man. Putin is responsible; imagine if he and all his generals were certain that they would have to answer for their war crimes just as thieves and murderers have to answer for crimes they commit in countries governed by the rule of law. That was the hope that animated international lawyers and human rights activists in the 1990s, when countries and civic groups working closely together established the International Criminal Tribunals for the Former Yugoslavia and for Rwanda, and ultimately the International Criminal Court. Russia, China, and the United States refused to submit to the Court\u2019s jurisdiction, however, precisely for fear that their warriors could be prosecuted.\nYet we now have the ability to collect evidence with individualized precision, through photographs, communications, and digital forensics. It is perfectly possible to design institutions and processes that can be trusted to bring at least the worst offenders to account, before global or regional tribunals comprised of judges from enough different countries applying strict enough standards to minimize the risk of political manipulation. In such a world, Putin could have been brought to account after his invasion and annexation of Crimea, or else been confined to Russia with henchmen increasingly afraid to carry out his orders.\nThat is the direction in which the world was moving before 9/11. It is where the world should move if we are to create a true 21st century global politics, a politics that recognizes not only the value and power of states but also of individuals \u2014 individual citizens and government officials \u2014 in ways that allow us both to harness their power and resources and to hold them accountable. We have technology that allows us to see both the eagle and the sparrow; it is time to develop the institutions to match.", "comment_count": 5, "like_count": 277, "created_time": 1649018963117, "comment": [{"user_id": "7ed247f6c763", "comment_time": 1649018963117, "comment": "On Sparrows and the War in Ukraine"}, {"user_id": "bb8d1bdf0153", "comment_time": 1649031442399, "comment": "Brilliant Anne-Marie.

I am completely committed to the intellectual independence and integrity of our work; it is the foundation of our reputation. I have racked my brain for the last two months, and certainly over the last two days, as to what I, in consultation with my leadership team, could or should have done differently about the departure of Barry Lynn and Open Markets from New America. At its core, this was a personnel issue that I knew others would see as a program issue. The way I saw it, I had three choices: I could keep an employee who had repeatedly violated the standards of honesty and good faith with his colleagues, including misleading me directly. I could fire him outright and try to find a leader for his program, which would force both his funders and his program staff, many of whom were young rising stars who both Barry and I have mentored, to choose between us and him. Or I could try to work with Barry to negotiate a cooperative spinning out of the Open Markets program, as we have done with a number of other programs.\nI chose the third option, one that was much better for Barry than an outright firing would have been. We have spent the last two months negotiating an exit agreement in good faith, contacting the program funders about the transfer of funds to what Barry described as the independent \u201cOpen Markets Institute,\u201d and ensuring that his staff would have a smooth transition. This was no \u201cexpulsion\u201d of his team; quite the contrary, our biggest concern was precisely that these were New America employees to whom we had real obligations and regretted losing. Moreover, we had prepared a statement announcing the spin-out that emphasized our respect for Open Markets\u2019 work, which New America has incubated and supported for almost a decade. Work that has included plenty of attacks on corporations that have funded other parts of New America. We were having productive conversations with Barry as recently as Monday.\nI write today, however, not to restate New America\u2019s position, which you can find here and here, but to look at the deeper tensions that anyone must face who tries to run an institution committed to intellectual independence, public debate, and a genuine diversity of views but who must also actually raise the funds to support that institution. New America was founded in 1999 in part to address the public problems that would be created by the massive disruption of the Digital Age, as one of our founders, Michael Lind, wrote about very clearly back in the 1990s. Much of New America\u2019s early money came from Silicon Valley. James Fallows, who was way ahead of many of his journalistic peers in covering tech, was our first board chair. He had become friends with Eric Schmidt when Eric was still at Novell and recruited him onto our board. Eric then went to Google and later became our board chair. He had been a personal friend of mine from other circles; he played an important role in convincing me to take the CEO job at New America. He has been very generous to New America and we are proud of our association with him, regardless of changing political fashions. Google and many other tech companies have also provided funding over two decades, supporting a lot of terrific work on issues that are absolutely central to the kind of country we will be in an age in which we live and work and shop online as much as we do in the physical world.\nAt the same time, we have bragged from the beginning, using various adjectives, that we are an independent, heterodox, iconoclastic place. Barry Lynn and Michael Lind have long argued about economic concentration; a year ago we held a debate between Barry and Michael for our staff on Hamiltonian versus Jeffersonian views of the economy. In the coming months, one of our programs is hosting several events about the dangers of monopolies. I am no stranger to situations in which a fellow or a program staff member writes something that directly contradicts the views of another program in ways that has upset a funder. It has happened a number of times in the education space, where funders and researchers have very strong views; in cybersecurity and privacy, where some of our international security experts have quite different views than the privacy champions of our Open Technology Institute do on what are legitimate security measures.\nIn the academy, where I spent the first 20 years of my career, the answer is simple. The university pays the salaries of professors. Donors know that academic independence is sacrosanct, even though they routinely fund new centers advancing subjects or even sets of views that they are partial to. As a nonpartisan think tank, one that prides itself on not being politically predictable, we uphold the same standards of intellectual independence. But we do not pay our researchers\u2019 salaries. Grants do \u2014 from foundations, individuals, and, increasingly, as the funding space gets tighter and tighter, corporations. We tell all of our donors that they cannot control the results of what they fund; we do not do contract research. But we also develop and maintain relationships with our donors as does any nonprofit institution.\nSo there\u2019s the tension. In practice, with an employee who had already surprised his colleagues unpleasantly \u2014 and many would say dishonestly \u2014 in the past, it meant that I wanted to see a press release before it went out. That is the reason that the Open Markets statement went up and then was taken down. It was posted before I had a chance to give it a final review. Indeed, I was talking to Barry about it on the phone when it went up. I have never \u2014 nor would I ever \u2014 censor anything, but I might ask questions about accuracy or tone. And, in this case, I wanted to give the funder a heads up that it was coming and send it over ourselves. That seems like a defensible minimum courtesy that an institution can offer its funders: we\u2019re about to do something you are really not going to like, but at least we are telling you about it. I recognize that the best journalists operate on a different principle \u2014 notice seems to imply interference. But we are not a newspaper, yet we try to uphold the best journalistic standards in our writing.\nGoing forward, these are the kinds of issues that we at New America will be engaging deeply and explicitly, asking ourselves how precisely we need to spell out the norms of what kind of behavior program directors can expect from other program directors \u2014 all of whom work hard to raise funds and maintain good, honest, and transparent relationships with donors \u2014 and what kinds of commitments we can make to our donors about notice and even right of response. It is also fundamentally about what kind of institution we want to be. We are not a university; we believe that we are a community of colleagues. We have a social compact and a special New America way of doing and being. How do those things factor in?\nI had to make a tough call. I still believe I made the right one consistent with our history and institutional values. However, I have also been reflecting on the choices we made in the rush of a big story that suddenly revealed that we were not in fact negotiating a cooperative spin-out with Barry Lynn but were in fact on the other end of a carefully prepared campaign, one that was already generating thousands of tweets and emails. In an effort to express New America\u2019s position quickly in 140 characters, I said that Ken Vogel\u2019s New York Times story was false.\nThe heart of my disagreement with the New York Times story is a passage that strongly implies a timeline where Eric Schmidt contacted us before we took Barry Lynn\u2019s statement criticizing Google offline, implying causality. That timeline is wrong. More broadly, many of the story\u2019s facts and selective quotations were presented in a way that gave the strong impression that we told Open Markets it had to leave because of pressure from Google. Again, this is simply not true. Still, the blanket claim that the entire story was \u201cfalse\u201d contributes to the kind of degradation of our national discourse that I often publicly lament. New America tries to uphold the best journalistic traditions, including verbal precision backed by evidence. At a time when it is critical to uphold the integrity of the news media, I regret my tweet.\nIt\u2019s been a challenging week for everyone at New America. Nothing we say is going to convince the many people who want to believe a David versus Goliath story of Barry Lynn versus big bad Google. On the contrary, Barry\u2019s new organization and campaign against Google is the opening salvo of one group of Democrats versus another group of Democrats in the run-up to the 2020 election, at a time when I personally think the country faces far greater challenges of racism, violence, a broken political system, and geographic and partisan divisions so great that we are losing any common sense of what we stand and strive for as a country.\nAssuring an open and competitive digital economy is a critically important issue, one that New America will continue to work on. We will continue to work on issues of education, work and family, national security, political reform, the future of work, and how to take advantages of the opportunities of digital technology directly by putting engineers side-by-side with policymakers. We will continually reflect on how best to reconcile the differences and tensions inherent in our work, while insisting on both intellectual independence and norms of honesty and good faith in our relationships with one another. But for us, organizations like us, and the media who cover us, let\u2019s start by speaking truth, even when it\u2019s complicated and messy and hard.", "comment_count": 23, "like_count": 335, "created_time": 1504306359772, "comment": [{"user_id": "7ed247f6c763", "comment_time": 1504306359772, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "575a1dfa789a", "comment_time": 1504309698472, "comment": "Dang, you were right.

On average, only people who make $150,000 a year or more say they value doing work that is important to them. Everyone else prioritizes an income that is stable and secure. Yet fewer than half of Americans earn a stable amount every month.\nEven those who are doing well today are understandably nervous about the future \u2014 and they believe, perhaps mistakenly, that their prospects for the future are better than the date suggest. (Take their views of their children: 73% think their kids will earn more than they do, yet fewer than half do today.)\nIn all four futures, we must address our slowing economic vitality \u2014 a dynamism that has, contrary to popular belief in the technology industry, not been accelerating. Sustained investment in technology by all sectors will need to be part of the solution, and slowing or avoiding technological change is a misguided attempt to put genies back into bottles.\nAcross all scenarios, we need an economy that offers more and better work to older people \u2014 with each passing year, there will be more and more older people willing and able to work, perhaps in non-traditional jobs.\nAcross all, we need to figure out how to land the rewards of work in places all across the country that are left behind.\nIn the \u201cGo\u201d and \u201cJump Rope\u201d scenarios, we continue our frenetic pace of work and need to figure out the relationship between workers and their employers \u2014 changes to how governments regulate different kinds of work and new social safety nets among others.\nIn the \u201cKing of the Castle\u201d and \u201cRock-Paper-Scissors\u201d scenarios, we need to urgently \u2014 even more urgently than today \u2014 raise the floor for those who are worst off.\nDebates about the future of work that are based on predictions should remember John Kenneth Galbraith\u2019s reminder that \u201cWe have two classes of forecasters: Those who don\u2019t know \u2014 and those who don\u2019t know they don\u2019t know.\u201d\nWe don\u2019t know, and the debate over what will happen (\u201cwill the robots take all the jobs\u201d) is distracting us from dealing with technology\u2019s effects today.

It is based on the soon-to-be-released findings of Shift: The Commission on Work, Workers, and Technology, a joint project of New America and Bloomberg to understand the future of work.\nThe future of work presents plenty of fodder for visionaries, both dark and light. But it is not so far away. After spending the past year convening leaders in every sector of American society to imagine the future 10\u201320 years out, we have realized that examples of multiple possible futures are already evident in the present. And no matter what the future holds, we have to face some choices today.\nRepresenting New America, I teamed up with Roy Bahat, the head of Bloomberg\u2019s venture fund, to launch a project that would get past the endless debates about no jobs versus an idyllic leisure-filled future. Instead of embarking on a futile quest to make accurate projections (where you can find people telling you only 10% of jobs will be automated, 47% of jobs, or literally every job, depending on where you look), we asked: what can we learn by just imagining the different scenarios that arise if we look at both sides of the coin? We called our effort Shift: The Commission on Work, Workers, and Technology.\nWe started with basic economic facts, some of which contradict the conventional wisdom. Technology leaders love to say that change is accelerating, but by many economic measures, that\u2019s simply untrue. We\u2019ve seen a decades-long decline in the rates at which Americans switch jobs, move long distances for a new job, or (most important) start businesses. The explanations for this decline vary, from high housing costs to regulatory burdens to care obligations, but the trend is clear and worrisome to many. It is one of the factors behind increasing geographic polarization: a number of thriving city hubs pulling away from rural areas and depressed cities.\nMoreover, for all the focus on technology as the principal driver of the future of work, the human factor is just as important. We are aging fast; by 2024, nearly one-quarter of the workforce is projected to be 55 or older \u2014 more than double the share in 1994. Indeed, the McKinsey Global Institute estimates that global aging will be so severe that we will need all the robots we can create and all the humans to be able to achieve the growth we need.\nWe then asked our Shift commissioners \u2014 a lively mix of leaders from multiple sectors, bringing together labor, civic, religious, academic, entrepreneurial, and more traditional business perspectives \u2014 two basic questions. (1) Will there be more or less work in the future? (2) Will work continue to be in its traditional form, full-time jobs, or separate into more \u201ctask\u201d work (like short-term contracts, part-time gigs, or other alternative arrangements)?\nMore than 100 Commission members met in five cities over the course of seven months. Their answers to these questions generated 44 colorful and concrete work futures, some positive and some negative. We distilled the common themes from these visions into four basic scenarios, which we are releasing today at the Milken Institute Global Conference. (We plan to release the full report on our findings later this month.)\n\nIn two of these scenarios, we will continue to work mostly in jobs, one where there\u2019s less work available in total (what we called the King of the Castle Economy, a winner-take-all game) and one where there\u2019s more work available (the Go Economy, where you can keep building as long as you want).\nIn the two scenarios where work evolves mostly into tasks, one has less work for us to do (the Rock-Paper-Scissors Economy, where we continue to compete in short spurts), and one more (the Jump Rope Economy, where individual workers can control the pace and pattern of their own careers, as long as they keep jumping).\nYou can find our detailed write-up of the scenarios here.\nContrast, for instance, the two scenarios in which there\u2019s more work to go around. In the Jump Rope economy, that work comes in little bits, requiring us to imagine new career paths, new ways of learning, and new social safety nets. In the Go world, our traditional jobs remain, and we need to work to ensure their benefits are available to everyone in our society. What we do with benefits, public assistance, business culture, and more will need to vary depending on how the future unfolds.\nAs interesting are the ways the scenarios are all the same. We learned that no scenario is inherently good or bad \u2014 we heard dystopias and utopias imagined for each. Every scenario requires real work from every sector of society \u2014 business, technology, civil society, academia, culture, government at all levels \u2014 and none will solve themselves. We will need, under any scenario, a new American identity that values the work society needs done, whether or not anyone is willing to pay for that work. Imagine a whole set of purposeful projects, from raising a family to mentoring young people to working in a community garden \u2014 all valuable work but not necessarily connected to income.\nElements of each of these scenarios are happening today. Almost all of them spell considerable uncertainty for almost all workers in comparison with the stability of widely available Industrial Age 9-to-5 jobs. Even in a world of more work and more jobs, the qualifications necessary to get and keep those jobs will likely change rapidly. And in a world of tasks, even where those tasks supplement jobs, decoupling the provision of benefits from specific employers will be essential for many workers.\nThe goal of the Shift Commission is to move the public conversation about the future of work forward. We encourage participants in that conversation to grapple with more realistic and varied visions of multiple possible futures. We also urge leaders and citizens to start thinking and acting now to create the public and private responses we need to ensure that the Digital Economy will work for everyone.\nTo conclude, consider some of the more positive futures, drawn from some of the specific examples our Shift Commissioners envisioned. Imagine a world, maybe in the task-based Rock-Paper-Scissors or Jump Rope economies, of \u201cEveryone a Coach.\u201d Sports coaches, of course. Vocal coaches, rock climbing coaches, gardening coaches, tech coaches, coaches for any activity in which continuous improvement is possible and desired. School coaches. Work coaches. Career coaches. Life coaches. Streams of data, about our own performance and that of others, will measure progress in just about everything we want to do. Teachers are one and done. Coaches are forever.\nOr consider, in any scenario, the idea of a \u201cTear-Down Squad.\u201d What happens to strip malls when e-commerce takes over for goods, and personal services can come to us? (Except for our favorite salons, which might be concentrated in renewed but much smaller downtowns.) What of all those office buildings, in a world where people hot-desk and work out of coffee shops? One of our members described the buildings and old infrastructure that need to be torn down in Atlanta alone. Tearing down the old means making way for the new, even if the new is a park, garden, or affordable housing. It is all part of the circular economy, which is another potential source of many jobs we cannot envisage today.\nStill another possibility, in the Go economy, is \u201cMasterCraft.\u201d Craft beer is exploding, led by Master Brewers, and it may just be the beginning. Etsy has expanded far beyond unusual holiday gifts to a marketplace for human creativity \u2014 arts and crafts. Now imagine a world in which Master Bakers, Master Builders, Master Masons, Master Carpenters and many others come back, plying their trades in high-end and highly local versions, often aided by 3D printing. The White House has announced its desire to see apprenticeships expand from 500,000 to 5 million. That many apprentices will need masters. As mass production makes room for customized production in food, shelter, and clothing \u2014 three of humans\u2019 most basic needs \u2014 and as higher education becomes something that happens in workplaces as well as schools, we could see the emergence of a 21st century guild system.\nThe care economy, the circular economy, and the craft economy are all possible. So too are much bleaker futures. We cannot sit back and wait for the future of work. We need to imagine and shape it now.\nAnne-Marie Slaughter is president and CEO of New America.

Pause, stop lies, save lives", "content": "Sharing online? Pause, stop lies, save lives\n\nSickening violence against innocent civilians in Ukraine has shocked the world and left many feeling helpless. But there are many ways we can help Ukrainians. Online especially, we can hinder the spread of harmful lies.\nDisinformation monitors say fake and misleading content about Ukraine is flooding the online sphere. A range of bad actors are exploiting the huge demand for news about the war, circulating old and misleading content to warp our understanding of events. They are getting millions of views. Disinformation actors aim to create confusion about perpetrators and a state of information paralysis. Scammers are exploiting public sympathy for financial gain or even worse, taking advantage of vulnerable refugees.\nVideos are particularly affected. Clips of past conflicts and even computer games are being passed off as on-the-ground reporting, often appearing alongside appeals for donations. In one case, a video filmed in Palestine in 2012 claimed to show a girl confronting soldiers in Ukraine.\nIn this polluted information environment, even the smallest actions by online users can have massive impacts. Sharing or commenting on a distorted content, even in good faith, can lend credibility and add to the tsunami of misinformation about Ukraine.\nSocial media platforms are taking steps to block or flag fake posts and their creators, but harmful, outlandish content is still breaking through. As individuals, there are some simple steps we can take ourselves to stop false information and conspiracies in their tracks.\nFirst and most importantly, we can learn to recognize the tell-tale signs of disinformation. If something looks odd, we can take a moment to verify content before passing it on to others. It\u2019s really that simple.\nBut recognizing false content can be harder in the heat of the moment. Often, fakes go viral because they trigger our deepest emotions \u2014 anger, fear, compassion. Most of us know we can\u2019t believe everything we see online, but if a post gets us worked up, we might share it without checking whether it\u2019s true.\nDisinformation about Ukraine is everywhere. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to keep a cool head online. So, next time you\u2019re about to react to or share some urgent-seeming update, stop. Take a breath and ask yourself these simple questions. If any content seems at all suspicious, don\u2019t share it.\n\n1. Who says?\nTake a very close look at the account that shared the post. Read their profile, search for their name online. Can you find any evidence that this person is qualified to share information about the situation in Ukraine? Are they a trusted expert on the region, or a news reporter on the ground? Or are they just another user \u2014 celebrity or not \u2014 sharing emotive content? If a friend or trusted contact shared the content, still check the original source. Be aware of bots \u2014 often very new accounts with few followers, or parody and other fake accounts. Though not a catch-all for disinformation spreaders, a blue tick beside the name means the user\u2019s identity has been verified.\n2. What do they say?\nDisinformation is cynically designed to reach a wide audience. One warning sign is if a post seems too desperate, using too many hashtags or throwing in unrelated trending keywords. Look at the language. Does it seem emotive, hysterical even? Are there sections in all caps, are there exclamation marks? If so, alarm bells should be ringing. Keep asking yourself, what is the poster trying to get you to do? Make sure you can identify the time and place a video or photograph was taken, ensuring the narrative aligns with the facts. Using Google\u2019s reverse image search can show if the image is actually from another context; YouTube Data Viewer can do the same for videos.\nIf someone is asking for donations, be especially careful. The war in Ukraine is generating millions in humanitarian funding from the public, but also creating opportunities for scammers. To avoid scams, be sure to donate only to recognized organizations before you part with any money.\n\n3. Do sources agree?\nDoes the post author name a reliable source for the information? If they don\u2019t, consider asking them for one. If they can\u2019t verify the information, they may take it down. Do your own search online. Are there lots of news articles about what you are seeing? Seek out and cross check the information against reputable news sources. Many media outlets now have dedicated fact-check teams, including Reuters, The Associated Press, BBC, and Agence France-Presse. See if they have already debunked the content as a fake. With images, look out for missing date or geographical information. Consider double checking the source using Google\u2019s image search function.\nIn this information war, we can all be online peacekeepers. By taking a breath before sharing on social media, and also encouraging others to pause, we can allow the facts to dominate in the fog of war.\nCheck out the following guides for more in-depth advice on how to spot and stop lies.", "comment_count": 1, "like_count": 10, "created_time": 1649878307598, "comment": [{"user_id": "beceee51050b", "comment_time": 1649878307598, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "30fb0f623247", "comment_time": 1649911353184, "comment": "Yes even here on Medium"}], "post_tag": ["Ukraine", "Disinformation", "Misinformation"]}, {"author": "Melissa Fleming", "post_id": "d15dbc463079", "user_id": "beceee51050b", "title": "Time to ditch our dirtiest addiction", "content": "Time to ditch our dirtiest addiction\n@UN/ R. Kollar\nOur addiction to fossil fuels is risking nothing less than life on earth. As if that wasn\u2019t enough, our reliance on coal, oil and gas undermines our ability to stand up to aggressive regimes. With prices soaring, these dangerous fuels aren\u2019t even cheap. We already have a way out \u2014 it\u2019s time we took it.\nSwitching to clean energy was always sensible. Now it\u2019s a no-brainer. Renewable power generated by the sun and wind doesn\u2019t emit harmful greenhouse gases that cause global warming. It also frees nations of relying on foreign fuel imports. And, after initial investments, the costs are low.\nWe know the stakes couldn\u2019t be higher. The climate emergency is already here. Our planet has already warmed by around 1.2 degrees, and the devastating effects are everywhere. Climate disasters forced 30 million people to flee their homes in 2020 \u2014 three times more than the number displaced by war and violence.\nThere is much worse to come if we fail to limit warming to within 1.5 degrees. This week, the UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) issued the world with a final warning, with the world\u2019s top climate scientists saying we must act \u201cnow or never\u201d to secure a liveable future on the planet.\nUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said that \u201clitany of broken promises\u201d had put the world on a \u201cfast track to climate disaster\u201d \u2014 a planet ravaged by unbearable heat, rising seas, deadly storms, water shortages, and mass extinction. The science is clear, he added, we are \u201csleepwalking into climate catastrophe.\u201d\nBut we are distracted. Just as we reach this critical juncture, multiple geopolitical shocks are undermining our resolve to tackle emissions. Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine has caused turmoil on global energy markets, sending major economies scrambling to replace gas as prices soar and threats are made over supply.\nThe crisis has seen many nations backtracking in the wrong direction, falling back on coal \u2014 the most polluting of all fossil fuels \u2014 to meet energy needs. This quick and dirty fix is driving global energy-related carbon emissions to record highs, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).\nWe can\u2019t afford this misstep. Our window of opportunity to stave off the worst outcomes is closing. The 1.5 degree goal remains just within our grasp. Reverting to coal is tantamount to abandoning it. It\u2019s not too late, but we must act now. And we really have our work cut out.\nOn current commitments, carbon emissions are projected to climb by almost 14% this decade, with most of that down to coal burning. Governments are reneging on pledges, even as the world hurtles towards tipping points that could trigger cascading and permanent damage to our only home.\nThe IPCC says global temperatures will stabilise when carbon emissions reach net zero. To keep 1.5 alive, emissions must fall by 45% by 2030, and we must achieve carbon neutrality by mid-century. If we triple the speed of the energy transition, and shift investments from dirty fuels to clean, we still have a chance.\nThe UN has been resolute in calling for change. We have no choice but to urgently phase out coal and massively increase investment in renewables. We must come together to do so, with a global coalition of wealthier countries and global finance helping nations make the switch to clean energy.\nGoing green makes economic sense too. The cost of renewables have plummeted, making solar now the cheapest electricity source in history. And the benefits don\u2019t end there. A recent US study suggested renewables could help avoid blackouts, create millions of jobs, and improve public health.\nOne thing is clear from recent events. Our addiction to fossil fuels makes us more vulnerable to geopolitical shocks. The IEA says there will be more turbulence to come unless we fix the broken global energy mix. The current crises must drive us forward into a carbon free future.\nThe case for renewables has never been stronger. They can help secure our energy supply, free us from our dependence on aggressors, and protect economies from global shocks. We have the power to regain control. We have the power to secure the future of life on earth. The time to do so is now.", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 169, "created_time": 1649285286110, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Climate Change", "Climate Action", "Renewable Energy", "United Nations"]}, {"author": "Melissa Fleming", "post_id": "d184261c8ca7", "user_id": "beceee51050b", "title": "Bombing the world\u2019s breadbasket", "content": "Bombing the world\u2019s breadbasket\nWheat fields in midsummer (August) in Ukraine, Oblast Lviv \u00a9 Raimond Spekking / CC BY-SA 4.0 (via Wikimedia Commons)\nFor the past month, the world has watched in horror as civilians suffer and die in Ukraine. They are being shelled in their homes, sheltering in freezing basements, and fleeing under fire. Yet even as we try to support Ukrainians and end the war, we cannot forget the vulnerable elsewhere. The Russian invasion is causing pain far beyond Ukraine\u2019s borders. A global hunger catastrophe is looming.\nWithin Ukraine, millions are suddenly facing hunger as food supply chains collapse and cities are left without supplies or aid. Seeking to replace those commercial supply chains, the World Food Programme (WFP) has pre-positioned bulk food rations outside cities under fire. It has so far delivered 12,000 tonnes of food, all sourced from within Ukraine.\nExports of food from Ukraine have ground to a halt, and the impacts are already being felt around the world. Long known as Europe\u2019s breadbasket, Ukraine produces a considerable amount of the world\u2019s food \u2014 including more than half of the WFP\u2019s wheat supply. This area of the Black Sea basin exported 12% of all calories traded globally. Let that sink in. It is now a war zone.\nIn these far from normal times, nothing is getting out. Ukrainian ports are closed, and Russian grain and fertilizer deals are on pause because of sanctions. WFP estimates 13.5 million tons of wheat, and 16 million tons of maize are frozen in the two countries. Already, vulnerable people are feeling the burn.\nThe first to be hit are those that rely directly on the region for their food. Forty-five African and least developed countries import at least a third of their wheat directly from Ukraine or Russia. Of those, 18 countries import at least 50 percent from the region, including Burkina Faso, Egypt, the DRC, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen.\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t stop there. The war has sparked turmoil on global grain markets, sending prices soaring. This comes as extreme weather events, conflict, the pandemic and inflation were already driving global food prices to what the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) says is an all-time high. The implications of wheat price hikes alone are shattering.\nTens of millions of hungry people rely on the WFP\u2019s wheat stores, from Ethiopia to Afghanistan, Syria to Yemen. Rising food prices have already forced the agency to cut rations after the average cost of WFP operations rose 36% since 2019. Related turmoil on energy markets has prompted fears things are set to get even worse.\nThe scale of global hunger is already eye-watering. After decades of success in reducing food insecurity, recent years have seen a reversal of those trends.\nThe WFP says 811 million now go to bed hungry every night, while the number of people facing acute food insecurity more than doubled \u2014 from 135 million to 276 million \u2014 since 2019. A total of 44 million people in 38 countries are on the edge of famine.\nThe crisis will hit people already suffering in unimaginable ways. In Yemen, where a horrific civil war has brought death and disease on a devastating scale, people will have even less to eat. For those in Lebanon, whose past years have been blighted by grinding financial and political crises, the Beirut port catastrophe, and the pandemic, price rises will spell further misery for untold millions.\nThe war in Ukraine will tip many more people around the world over the edge into hunger. That\u2019s why UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres has called the invasion of Ukraine \u201can assault on the world\u2019s most vulnerable people and countries.\u201d A month into this war, its full impact has not yet been felt, and it is only set to get worse. We need to respond, now.\nEven without Ukrainian and Russian exports, the problem seems to lie with distribution rather than supply. There is enough food for everyone in our world. But distribution and logistics issues become an even greater challenge when global supply chains are already overstretched and many air and land routes blocked. Meanwhile, rising prices mean the World Food Programme has to stretch its food budget. If funds are not topped up, it will have far less to distribute to the hungry.\nThe UN is mustering its forces to find ways to head off the worst of this perfect storm. Mr. Guterres has set up a multi-agency Global Crisis Response Group on Food, Energy and Finance to coordinate the global response to the worldwide impacts of the war in Ukraine. The Group will provide analysis and make recommendations to avert large-scale crises in the food, energy and financing sectors.\nAs its first urgent policy recommendation on the food crisis, the group is calling on countries to prevent hoarding and speculative movements that would further threaten supply. It is urging all nations to keep their food markets open and to cease trade restrictions and export bans. This is the only way to avoid the same \u2018global scramble\u2019 that we saw in the race for COVID-19 vaccines.

Chopped liver, hard-boiled egg with saltwater, charoset with horseradish and matzo, matzo ball soup, gefilte fish, brisket pot roast, coconut macaroons, and citrus candies. A classic American Ashkenazi lineup, always served on the same china and table linens. And because my grandmother purchased almost everything from a deli or made it from a box, the individual courses never changed. Veganizing my grandmother\u2019s menu requires making some substantial changes. At the same time, it presents an opportunity to learn about each dish and figure out how to make them on my own.\nMe and my Grandma Ruth in her kitchen\nThis menu is vegan and also does not include kitniyot, which are legumes and other seeds that Ashkenazi Jews traditionally do not eat during Passover. Most vegan Passover recipes ignore the kitniyot restriction (which has been overturned in the Reform and Conservative communities), but I am leaving them out here so that these recipes can be used for any Passover seder. Use olive oil or refined coconut oil, as most other vegetable oils are considered kitniyot. I am not a rabbi or anything like that so don\u2019t take me as your authority for what to use if you\u2019re not sure!\nThese recipes are designed to work together and employ many of the same ingredients. You can chop a bunch of herbs at once to use for the gefilte fish, matzo ball soup, and pot roast. Potato starch stands in for eggs in a few of the recipes. You can use tapioca starch instead but you\u2019ll want to double the volume. One 11-ounce box of matzo, run through the food processor, should give you 2 cups of matzo meal. Each recipe makes enough for 4 people. Almost everything here can be prepared a few days in advance.\nFresh herbs feature heavily throughout. They add a lot of flavors and are symbols of Passover and springtime, so I suggest sticking to fresh herbs as much as possible rather than using dried ones.\nMock Chopped Liver\nChopped liver is a common appetizer for Jewish holidays and nut-based vegetarian versions have been around for a long time. Adding lentils or beans is a great way to make it creamy, but since they fall into the kitniyot category I have used cashews instead here. This mushroom and pecan pat\u00e9 taste much better when made a day or two in advance. If you make it right after your charoset you can just reuse the food processor without washing it.\n1 cup pecans or walnuts (soaked)\n1/4 cup cashews (soaked)\n2 Tbsp oil\n1 sweet onion\n1/2 pound button mushrooms\n1 clove garlic\n1 tsp salt\n1/8 tsp mace or nutmeg\n1/4 cup dry white wine\nFreshly ground black pepper, to taste\n1 Tbsp fresh parsley\n1 Tbsp fresh tarragon\n1/8 tsp kala namak (optional)\nSoak the pecans and the cashews for several hours (separately) or boil them for a few minutes, then drain them and discard the water. Bring a skillet to medium-low heat with half the oil and add the onion. Allow the onion to caramelize by stirring it occasionally over the course of about 15 minutes, while you loosely chop the mushrooms. You can speed the caramelizing process up a bit by adding a pinch of baking soda. Once the onion has started to brown, scoot it to the outer edge of the pan. Add the other tablespoon of oil and the mushrooms to the center of the pan and saut\u00e9 over medium heat until the mushrooms start to brown. Add the salt, mace, and a clove of crushed garlic. Once the liquid from the mushrooms has evaporated, add the wine and let it reduce for a few minutes. Turn off the heat and allow the mixture to cool slightly.\nTransfer the cooled onion and mushroom mixture to a food processor with the drained cashews and black pepper. Pulse until it forms a creamy paste, then add the pecans and pulse until they are ground up but still crumbly. Scoop the pat\u00e9 into a bowl (lined with cheesecloth if you want to invert it and serve it as a mound) and refrigerate. Allow it to come to room temperature before serving and garnish it with chopped fresh parsley and tarragon. If you like an eggy chopped liver you can sprinkle it with some kala namak too.\n\nAvocado with Salt Water\nThe key element of this simple course is a bowl of saltwater, meant to symbolize the tears of the enslaved Jews. You dip a sprig of parsley or some other herb into the water before eating it. Evidently, some families use potatoes as the thing to dip; mine always used hard-boiled eggs. I always hated eggs so I just stuck to parsley. When I went vegan my family gave me a whole avocado with my bowl of saltwater, which was a big improvement. The avocado could be dressed up with some customary greens and bitter herbs into a simple salad: sliced avocado + chopped endive and parsley + sliced red onion, with a ramekin of saltwater for the traditional dipping. This vegan Passover egg also looks pretty fun, if eggs are your thing.\nHillel Sandwich with Charoset\nThis is the part of the seder where you make little sandwiches with matzo. Inside goes a huge slice of raw horseradish and a smear of charoset, which is a spiced fruit and nut spread that symbolizes the mortar used by enslaved Jews. Charoset is generally vegan. Ashkenazi versions usually incorporate walnuts, apple, and cinnamon. Some recipes use honey, which can easily be replaced with another sweetener. In this charoset, I have adapted a vegan floral apple honey recipe to use the traditional apples in a different way. Depending on when Passover falls and what climate you live in, this might give you a chance to incorporate some springtime blooms.\nCharoset:\n2 medium-sized green apples, roughly chopped (peels on)\n1 chamomile tea bag\n1 cup of unsprayed flower petals such as dandelions, roses, elderflowers (optional)\n2 Tbsp sugar\n1 tsp lemon juice\n1 cup golden raisins\n1 cinnamon stick\n4 cardamom pods, smashed\n1 cup walnuts (soaked)\n1/4 cup sweet kosher wine or grape juice\n1/8 tsp salt\nSoak the walnuts for several hours or boil them for a few minutes, then drain them and discard the water. Boil 1 cup of fresh water and steep the chamomile tea and other flowers in it until it begins to cool. Pour this tea, together with the petals, into a food processor with the chopped apples (discard the teabag). Blend. Strain through a fine-mesh strainer into a saucepan. Feed the strained apple mush to your companion animals. Add the sugar, lemon juice, raisins, cinnamon, and cardamom, and bring to a boil. Simmer until the mixture reaches a thick jam-like consistency. Discard the spices. Transfer the mixture back into the food processor and process until smooth. Add the strained walnuts, wine, and salt. Pulse until most of the walnuts are chopped. This is best made a day ahead.\n\nMatzo Ball Soup\nThere is no lack of egg-free vegan recipes for matzo ball soup. My brother, pictured below eating a matzo ball, uses methylcellulose as the binding agent. Many vegan recipes use tofu, while others use aquafaba, flax meal, or potato or tapioca starch. Chia seeds work the same as flax seeds and are not considered kitniyot. I like to keep it simple with potato starch. Baking powder makes the matzo balls puff out as they simmer. Most baking powder contains corn starch though, so use one that is labeled kosher for Passover.\n\nMatzo ball soup requires a really flavorful broth, something most vegan recipes achieve by adding chicken-free bouillon. But these usually get their flavor from yeast extracts and don\u2019t appear to be kosher for Passover. I also like to add a pinch of MSG, which theoretically should be kosher for Passover but is not always clearly labeled as such. So I use simpler ingredients in this recipe. Straight vegetable broth has too earthy of a flavor, but coconut water provides a subtle sweetness. And making the matzo balls with a seasoned vegan \u201cschmaltz\u201d imparts more flavor and color into the broth as they cook.\nBroth:\n1 onion, peeled and halved\n1 small fennel bulb, stalk and fronds only\n3 large carrots, peeled and chopped\n3 ribs celery, chopped\n1 large parsnip, peeled and chopped\n3-inch piece of ginger, sliced\n1 bulb garlic, halved\n1 small sheet of kombu\nstems from cilantro, parsley, and dill\n1 tsp black peppercorns\n2 cups coconut water\nsalt to taste\nPut everything in a slow cooker or stockpot and cover with 6 cups of water. If using a slow cooker, slow cook on low for 12 hours. For the stovetop, cover the pot and bring the pot to a boil and then reduce it to a simmer for an hour or two. Strain the broth once cooled. When it comes time to simmer the matzo balls, add salt to taste, starting with 1/2 teaspoon.\nMatzo Balls:\n3 Tbsp oil\n1 tsp coriander seeds\n1/8 tsp mace or nutmeg\n1/4 cup chopped onion\n1 cup matzo meal\n3 Tbsp potato starch\n1 tsp baking powder (double-acting, kosher for Passover)\n1/2 tsp salt\n1/4 tsp pepper\n1 cup seltzer water\nHeat the oil in a small pan and add the onion, coriander seeds, and mace. Saut\u00e9 for a few minutes, then strain the oil and discard the solids. This is your vegan schmaltz.\nIn a large bowl, combine the matzo meal, potato starch, salt, and baking powder. Give it a good mix with a fork, then pour in the seltzer and schmaltz. Mix the batter lightly until just combined. Refrigerate the batter for at least half an hour to allow it to suck up the moisture. Once chilled, the batter should be drier than cookie dough, with just enough moisture to hold it together. If the matzo balls are too wet they will disintegrate in the pot.\nRoll the chilled batter into 8\u201312 balls. Bring your broth to a boil. Add the matzo balls and reduce the heat to a low simmer. Cover the pot and simmer for half an hour. To serve, remove the matzo balls with a slotted spoon and pour the broth through a fine-mesh strainer. Garnish with fresh chopped cilantro, dill, parsley, and fennel fronds.\n\nGefilte F\u2019sh\nEvery year at the seder my mom would reminisce about back when she and my dad were first dating and made gefilte fish from scratch. I always imagined it as a pretty gory ordeal, and reading recipes seems to confirm that. My grandmother served the kind that comes in a jar. I have had success making a vegan version with okara, the pulp leftover from making soy milk. Other recipes tend to replace the fish with chickpeas, tofu, or potato. I tried jackfruit, which was a little too dry, and lion\u2019s mane mushroom, which worked well but is rather expensive and a tad squidgy. So here we combine the two for our shredded fish mixture.\n2 small carrots\n1 sheet kombu\n1 bay leaf\n2 Tbsp dry white wine\n1/2 lb lion\u2019s mane mushroom\n1/2 can jackfruit (14 oz can)\n3 Tbsp oil (divided)\n1 1/8 tsp salt (divided)\n1 small onion\n1 small parsnip\n1 small fennel bulb\n1/2 lemon, juice and zest\n1 Tbsp each chopped fresh dill, parsley, and tarragon\n1/4 cup matzo meal\n2 Tbsp potato starch\n2 tsp dulse flakes\nblack pepper to taste\n1/8 tsp allspice\n1/8 tsp agar powder\nSlice one of the carrots into at least 8 coins at a diagonal, break the sheet of kombu into pieces and drain the jackfruit. Place them in a saucepan with the bay leaf, white wine, and 1 cup of water. Cover and bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Tear the lion\u2019s mane mushroom into pieces and saut\u00e9 it in a tablespoon of oil with a teaspoon of salt. Cook them until they release their liquid and it evaporates. When the jackfruit has softened, use a slotted spoon to transfer it from the pot into a mixing bowl. Mash it with a potato masher. Check on the carrots periodically and remove the pan from the heat once they are soft.\nCoarsely chop the onion, remaining carrot, parsnip, and fennel and pulse them in a food processor until finely chopped. Add the jackfruit and cooked mushroom along with the juice and zest of half a lemon and the dill, parsley, and tarragon. Pulse briefly to combine. In your mixing bowl, combine the matzo meal, potato starch, dulse flakes, black pepper, and allspice. Use a spatula to transfer the veggies and mushrooms into the bowl and mix everything together. Refrigerate for an hour.\nForm the chilled gefilte fish mixture into 8 \u201310 oval patties (I used an ice cream scoop). Pour a tablespoon of oil into a baking pan and coat the bottom. Arrange the gefilte fish in the pan and drizzle the remaining tablespoon of oil on top of them. Bake for 40 minutes at 350\u00b0, turning halfway through if the bottoms are getting crispy, and then allow to cool.\nWhile they are cooling, strain the water from the saucepan into a measuring cup. Top the liquid off with water until it is a full cup. Set the carrots aside and discard the kombu and bay leaf. Return the cup of liquid to the saucepan. It should be cool at this point, which is necessary for the agar to set properly. Stir in the agar and 1/8 teaspoon of salt. Bring to a boil, covered, and then reduce to a simmer for 5 minutes. Allow the liquid to cool a bit before pouring over the patties. Garnish each piece with a carrot slice. Serve at room temperature with prepared horseradish (chrain, below).\n\nChrain:\n1 medium beet\n2 inches of horseradish root\n1 Tbsp lemon juice\n1 tsp salt\n1/2 tsp sugar\nGrate the beet and horseradish and combine them with the remaining ingredients.\nPot Roast\nMy grandmother made her pot roast with brisket, which is obviously not vegan so we\u2019re going to use portobello mushrooms instead. You can also replace the brisket with jackfruit, in which case I suggest boiling the jackfruit in water and crushing it slightly with a potato masher before adding it to the pot.\n4\u20136 portobello mushrooms\n2 lbs red or gold potatoes\n1 lb carrots\n1 medium-sized onion\n2 Tbsp oil\n1 oz dried porcini mushrooms (optional)\na few cloves of garlic, minced\n2 tsp salt\n1 tsp black pepper\n1 tsp rosemary\n1 tsp thyme\n1/2 tsp smoked paprika\n1/4 tsp allspice\n1/4 tsp mace or nutmeg\n1/2 cup sweet kosher wine or grape juice\n2 cups vegetable broth\n2 Tbsp tomato paste\n2 Tbsp brown sugar\n2 Tbsp potato starch\nchopped fresh parsley for garnish\nQuarter the portobello mushrooms. Peel the carrots and potatoes and chop them into large chunks of similar width. Slice the onion in half and remove the outer peel.\nHeat a 6-quart dutch oven over medium-high heat and add the oil. Once the oil is hot, add the mushrooms and let them sear for a minute or two. Reduce the heat to low and add the garlic, salt, and spices. Once the water from the mushrooms has evaporated, add the wine. Stir together the vegetable broth with the tomato paste and brown sugar and add it to the pot along with the potatoes, carrots, and porcini mushrooms.\nCover the pot and bring it to a boil. At this point, you can either transfer it to bake in the oven at 350\u00b0 for around 2 hours, or turn down the heat and let it simmer on the stove. Stir it every half hour or so to help everything cook evenly. The thickness of the carrots will determine how long it takes.\nOnce the carrots have softened to your liking, whisk the potato starch into a couple of tablespoons of cold water and add it to the pot on the stove. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer until the gravy thickens. You\u2019ll want to serve this right away (garnished with a little parsley) as the potato starch gravy can get gloopy if left too long.\n\nDessert\nTraditionally the last thing eaten at a seder is the afikomen, which is a piece of matzo. In my family, this was a special piece of Shmurah matzo, which is round, extra-dry, and more expensive owing to having been observed by rabbis from the moment the wheat is harvested. That was the dessert, so it feels weird to put a normal dessert on a seder menu. But my grandmother did put out sweets, namely Manischewitz macaroons and fruit slice candies. It seems that the candies are actually vegan, as they are made with agar rather than gelatin, but they don\u2019t seem to sell them where I live. Instead, I made some candied oranges to go with my macaroons.\n\nMacaroons:\n1 can coconut milk\n3/4 cup sugar\n1/4 cup potato starch\n6 oz (2ish cups) shredded coconut flakes\n1/2 cup matzo meal\n1/8 tsp salt\nSift all the dry ingredients together in a mixing bowl and stir in the coconut milk. Refrigerate the batter for half an hour, then use a cookie scoop to scoop it out onto baking sheets lined with parchment paper. Bake at 350\u00b0 for 20\u201325 minutes or until the tops begin to brown\nCandied Oranges:\n2\u20134 oranges\n2 cups sugar\n10 black peppercorns\n3 cardamom pods, smashed\n3 cloves\nIn a medium-sized pot, combine the sugar and spices with 2 cups of water. Bring to a boil. Meanwhile, wash the oranges and slice them, using a mandolin if you have one. Place them into the boiling pot of syrup and reduce the heat to a simmer. Simmer for about 40 minutes or until the white pith of the orange becomes translucent. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the oranges to a cooling rack or a piece of parchment paper. Strain the syrup to use in tea, cake, charoset, or anywhere else you might use a flavored syrup. Let the oranges dry for at least 24 hours. You can speed up the process by putting them in the oven at 200\u00b0. Dredge the dried oranges in more sugar if desired.\n\nI hope that these recipes have inspired some ideas for your own Passover cooking.

In that moment, everything became clear. To me, he was obviously saying that Russia is coming to kill the Ukrainian nation and culture.\nIt\u2019s classic fascism: \u201cWe are going to establish order at your place \u2014 with military help.\u201d\nOn the 24th, I went to work at my private medical facility to wrap a few things up. I\u2019ve been a surgeon since 1984. I currently work in two fields: emergency reconstructive and plastic surgery. I\u2019ve lived my whole life in Mariupol. I went to college here and work here.\nWhen Russia first attacked Ukraine in 2014\u20132015, I was offering medical help to the Ukrainian Army. Later, I came back to normal life and my private practice. But with a neighbor like Russia, and a front line only 30 kilometers from the city, I knew it was too risky to invest money in any private business in Mariupol.\nA few months ago, I was reading up on current events in social media and realized we were moving in the direction of war. So, I prepared my exit backpack \u2014 it stood nice and ready, and by the end of the day on February 24, I picked up my surgical instruments, drove out to the military hospital in the closed part of the city, and offered my help. The head of the facility knew me very well, and they were happy to have me there.\nI was performing surgeries by the next day. The injured kept coming. Generally, I would work on the heavily wounded. I tried to save some people\u2019s lives, others\u2019 limbs, and some just needed hope that they\u2019d get better.\nAt first, they would bring in only the injured soldiers. Those soldiers would be processed in an observation hall and then moved to one of three places: X-ray, patient rooms, or one of five operating tables.\nWhen a few injured soldiers from the front lines were dropped off at once, everyone available got to work. Up to eight people would work on one soldier. First, you\u2019d have to cut through their clothes (which is not simple, with the frost outside). Then, anesthesiologists would get to work, and then teams of surgeons.\nWe worked fast to not lose patients, especially at the first stage; they were coming in with low blood pressure, shock pain, and heavy bleeding. Many soldiers came with modern NATO tourniquets (that super-cool tool saved the lives of many Ukrainian soldiers in our hospital). Most of them are highly trained in how to apply those tourniquets \u2014 and applied they were, massively. Later, doctors had to sort out where tourniquets were actually needed or not.\nMedical workers treat a man, wounded by shelling, in a hospital in Mariupol, Ukraine, Friday, March 4, 2022. Photo: AP Photo/Mstyslav Chernov\nI\u2019ve been a surgeon for 38 years. I\u2019ve seen a lot in my career, but so many wounded, and so severely \u2014 never. Almost all the injuries were fragmentation wounds, and all of them were different. Bomb explosions, mines, grenades. Embedded, through-and-through, single, and often multiple wounds.\nShelling tore off people\u2019s arms and legs, so we were doing a lot of amputations. If the fragments hit the stomach we did resection, taking out part of the intestines to save a soldier\u2019s life. Sadly, a fragment to a skull meant a bad prognosis.\nThere were mutilated faces. Missile fragments had turned jaws into a mixture of teeth and bones; sometimes, the fragments went through the neck.\nOne 20-year-old soldier had part of his larynx torn out. When they brought him in, his head was hanging down, otherwise, he would have choked on his own blood. It was a miracle he made it to the hospital. We intubated him, folded up his larynx, then he was hooked to a tracheostomy tube. And that kiddo made it! Even better, he was walking around later, hugging the medical staff. He couldn\u2019t talk anymore, though; he lost his vocal cords.\nThere were serious injuries to pelvic organs. Two soldiers were brought in, fists holding pressure on their wounds. Their friends had their arms inside the pelvic wounds, stemming the blood flow. We were able to save those two.\nI performed five restorative surgeries on hip and shoulder arteries. In a different situation, patients faced a risk of losing their limbs, but we managed to restore blood flow there.\nI heard the stories from wounded soldiers \u2014 not only from Azov Regiment, there were not even half of them there \u2014 but from marines and other units of the Ukrainian military. They knew they were doomed, and had no illusions of anyone coming to get them out. Yet, not even once did I hear despair in their words. They understood very well that they had to sacrifice their lives and destroy the enemy, as many as they could, to secure our victory. Death did not scare them.\nEvery day on the job, the circle around Mariupol tightened. Local hospitals suffered from a crazy number of injured civilians. There was a shortage of medical supplies and helping hands. Civilians kept coming when they heard our military hospital still operated. We opened the gates, let everyone in, walking or driving, and tried our best.\nNot even once did I hear despair in their words. They understood very well that they had to sacrifice their lives and destroy the enemy, as many as they could, to secure our victory.\nThe need among civilians to seek out our hospital was increasing day by day.\nI heard, and saw with my own eyes, brutal stories. One young woman, less than 20, was sitting in her room, reading a book. She came to us, her face covered with a shawl. I took it off, and she was missing half a nose, her upper lip, and her teeth. I restored her upper lip and fixed her nasal breathing. Everything else will require a complicated reconstruction process after the war is over.\nAnother time, two kids were brought in. Fragmentation injuries. An 11-year-old girl died in 20 minutes; we saved the other.\nWhy did it happen to them? Because they lived in Ukraine.\nThe war made it clear that Russians didn\u2019t come to fight Ukrainian soldiers, but to bulldoze our land. When it came to Mariupol, all major electrical lines were destroyed first. Next, all of our water supplies were bombed. Finally, all the infrastructure and cellular towers were ruined.\nIt\u2019s possible to live like that for two to three days \u2014 but when you don\u2019t hear news, and you\u2019ve gone five days separated by constant gunfire from loved ones who live just a few blocks away, a terrible psychological pressure sets in.\nLooting started on the 28th. Eventually, every store, no matter what they sold, was robbed. The city turned into a garbage pile. I blame the city administration for much of this.\nHaving said that, I was impressed with the cops. Those who stayed to defend our city under artillery fire were pulling people out from under the ruins, driving them to the hospitals, securing the means to heat the hospitals. It\u2019s scary work.\nGlory to all the defenders who are fighting for our Ukrainian land and nation, I bow down to you!\nWhen the enemy opened chaotic fire on the city, he didn\u2019t care where the military was. The high rises standing in the way of pushing deeper into the city didn\u2019t stop Russian killers from firing.\nAir bombing by Russian aviation intensified every day. When the city gets hit by a 500 kg bomb, every living thing in a 100-meter radius dies from the impact. All the window frames in the nine-story buildings nearby would be smashed, something would catch fire, and the trees would turn into 3\u20134-meter stumps. This is the horror of war in the 21st century.\nTanks were pounding from their cannons. The injured people, once in the hospital, told me that tanks were hitting 2\u20133 kilometers out for the sake of killing as many soldiers and civilians as they could.\nOne day the rear of the building next to mine was hit. The impact tore a 1.5-meter hole through the ninth floor. The outside wall was simply smashed into the building. Several apartments turned to rubble. The strike split the building in half.\nAt the time of such massive destruction during the blockade, I started to hear people using a new word: \u201caccumulators.\u201d These are improvised hiding places for people with nowhere else to hide, like gyms or shopping mall basements, or the bomb shelter in our former theater. Some people ran to these places from destroyed parts of the city, some from destroyed buildings or bomb shelters. Local administration sent food and water to these \u201caccumulators,\u201d and people stood in line to get into them.\nA woman holds a child in an improvised bomb shelter in Mariupol, Ukraine, Monday, March 7, 2022. Photo: AP Photo/Mstyslav Chernov\nI tried to get home every day to make sure my wife was okay. In this war, she was making food and fire to keep warm with our neighbors. We had some food, so she decided to cook and bring meals to the soldiers in our hospital. She wasn\u2019t afraid of any kind of work, be it psychological help to our patients or nursing assistance.\nMy wife told me a story: She once came out of the hospital and saw a 16-year-old kid, just standing there, shaking. He was walking down the street with his dad when a bomb killed his father. My wife talked to him, comforted the kid the best she could, and went back to work.\nSometime later she came out again. The boy was bent over his father\u2019s body on a stretcher, rubbing his hands together and asking: \u201cWhat will I say to mom now\u2026 ?\u201d\nAfter some time, dead bodies were laying around the city.\nOn March 8, I happened to be on duty with the hospital chief. By then the number of casualties had increased significantly, so we talked about the first mass graves. We didn\u2019t look for documents to confirm, we just buried people to avoid unsanitary conditions.\nA man carries his child away from the damage by shelling a maternity hospital in Mariupol, Ukraine, on March 9, 2022. Photo: Evgeniy Maloletka/AP\nBy this point, airstrikes were becoming more frequent, and my wife couldn\u2019t go out anymore. The risk of death was too high.\nEarly in the morning on March 15, three rockets hit our hospital. One exploded in the reception area and heavily injured a soldier. The next night, on the 16th, the artillery style seemed different, and there were fewer hits from our side. That\u2019s why, early the next morning, I decided it was time to leave the hospital.\nI drove to pick up my wife, unaware of the ambush Russian soldiers had set up along the road. We noticed them later, as we took the same road to leave the city. Thank God they didn\u2019t seem interested in us. My guess is they were waiting for an attack from our soldiers. We simply got lucky.\nI stopped by my mom\u2019s place to say goodbye. She is bedbound, and my sister looks after her.\nThere were no organized evacuation routes, so we had to get out on our own. To make it past multiple Russian checkpoints on the road to Tokmack, we deleted everything on our cellphones. It helped that I was a Mariupol resident \u2014 plus, I\u2019m over 60. People my age get bothered less.\nI am in Stockholm now, visiting with my family. After leaving Mariupol I really wanted to hug my kids and grandkids.\nI plan to return in a week.\nI do not want to live in a Russian colony. The essence of a colony is the same: a tzar who thinks everyone else is a slave. From the beginning, Ukraine has built a foundation formed on democratic principles. Your voice can be heard here, you can express yourself. To what extent we live up to these ideals is a separate question. But we have freedom of speech, and you can express your thoughts in whatever language you speak \u2014 be it Ukrainian, Russian, or Greek.\nThe only problem is that I\u2019m over 60, so I can\u2019t join the military forces of Ukraine.\nBut I will find a use for myself in this war.", "comment_count": 93, "like_count": 8337, "created_time": 1649016420568, "comment": [{"user_id": "f9fd07c8c84d", "comment_time": 1649016420568, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "e6f146b40a1b", "comment_time": 1649369403146, "comment": "I also thank you for your service to humanity.

Tiny little thing, dissatisfied with everything. These days my sister, despite going through it all, says that she is the happiest person because she has everything!\nPhoto: Valeria Gurskaya\nNow six of us will get back on our feet in Vinnytsia and decide on the next move. No matter the place, there\u2019s no feeling of complete safety anymore. That\u2019s all over.\nIn Mariupol, I worked at a chain beauty supply store, and my husband was out to sea for a year. Typical port city situation. There were five of us: dad, mom, my two younger sisters (one was nine months pregnant), and me.\nThe streets\nPhoto: 0629ua\nWhen the war started, small subdivisions and villages outside of the city were occupied rapidly, all at once. Fighting was raging on the routes out of the city, so we couldn\u2019t react, form a column, and evacuate.\nPhoto: 0629ua\nWhen electricity and water went out, people stopped coming to work. Instead, their stores were broken into. People were looting, stealing food and supplies, things they needed and didn\u2019t. Mad Max universe.\nStore windows everywhere were covered in blood. People were fighting the looters with fists and stones, pushing one another to get the last bread and water. All that was happening in the midst of shooting, mine explosions, and airstrikes.\nPhoto: Demenkova Anastasiia\nYou\u2019d go into a store, and the planes would come. You\u2019d hear rockets whistling, mines exploding. People falling to the ground, covering their faces and ears. My hands were shaking nonstop.\nThe scariest part was when the gas went out. It was -10\u00b0C outside, snowing. All the trees were wet. It\u2019s hard to make fire with that. People started bringing out old tables and chairs to make fire for meals. Other old furniture was burned to stay warm.\nPeople managed somehow to find food and share it with one another. Our family is big. We had to come outside often in order to cook and feed everyone.\nThere was a bomb shelter next to us, though it was actually basement storage for a gym. When 1,000 people from a nearby village were evacuated and placed there, it was maxed out. The planes would come, and we would run there, but they wouldn\u2019t let us in. They told us to hide in buildings, under fences, anywhere else.\nBy this point, buildings were already destroyed. We were breathing dust and smoke. The snow was falling mixed with ashes.\nPhoto: Demenkova Anastasiia\nWe never knew where the flying was coming from. We heard a loud shot, then whistling. You only have time to react and drop to the ground, open your mouth, close your eyes, and cover your head.\nOne time my dad and I got caught under fire while we were trying to get some water for the family. Fear made me cry. The first thought is \u201dwe are going to die!\u201d The second, \u201cGood thing I will die fast, it\u2019s better than getting crippled and dying in agony.\u201d But my dad said:\n\u201cYou can\u2019t cry now; you won\u2019t see where to run to.\u201d\nI was living through it: every shooting, every day, until March 17.\nBuildings\nThe buildings around us were burning up like a box of matches. How are you going to call the fire department when there\u2019s no connection? How are you going to put fire out if there\u2019s no water?\nPhoto: mariupolnow\nWhen a missile hit a building, people ran. Bedridden or pets stayed and burned alive.\nOther old people, who stayed in Mariupol and couldn\u2019t walk or run fast enough, refused to eat. This way, they could die faster and not burden their families.\nAt night it wasn\u2019t so scary. Our building had no windows anymore, but the temperature inside was 4\u00b0C; in the basement it was 2\u00b0C. So, we tried wrapping ourselves in blankets and getting some sleep on our beds. At least one person kept watch and listened at all times. If we heard them yell \u201cplane!\u201d we ran out.\nIt was scarier during the day. Missiles were flying from everywhere. One spot would get hit with up to five at a time, and the building would explode with people inside.\nOur building got hit for the first time on March 5. The shelling from the missile wounded a little girl from the first floor, tearing off her glutes. A woman was brought in from the second-floor walk-up, her legs broken in all places, hanging like spaghetti.\nPhoto: Demenkova Anastasiia\nEver since I was a child, I\u2019ve always wanted to be a surgeon. I was preparing for it up until the ninth grade. But my parents didn\u2019t have enough money to send me to medical college. I did manage to work at a private clinic as an administrator. Often, I would help the surgeons during operations, sometimes handing them instruments, sometimes just observing the process. I learned this way.\nMy neighbor, Zhenia, is a surgeon. Together we administered first aid, tried to stop the bleeding. We applied splints and bandages, gave painkiller injections. Then we asked volunteers to transport the wounded to the hospital, which was 500 meters from our building. Those who went there didn\u2019t come back; their cars were shot at, and the guys stayed at the hospital.\nOnce, at noon, the corner of a neighboring building got hit with a rocket. The shock wave broke windows in the apartment across from ours. The schoolteacher who lived there had her legs crushed to a pulp. Her daughter was shaking and screaming: \u201cSomeone help!\u201d\nI was close by, so I ran out. Her legs were ripped to pieces, blood everywhere from damaged arteries. She was 87 years old and conscious the whole time.\nMy neighbor, the surgeon, came running also. We managed to lay some splints and bandages, carried her to the ground floor, and took her to the hospital.\nWhen the cleanup started, the air raids stopped. Russians came in.\nLater came the fear and shame. Russian soldiers, after seeing people around the walk-ups, began throwing food and cigarettes at them, right into the dirt, in a degrading way. Same food and cigarettes they\u2019d stolen from our stores. And people took it, like dogs, stuffing their pockets with grain, because it was the only option left.\nThe hospital\nPhoto: mariupolnow\nWe asked Russian soldiers:\n\u201cWhat about the wounded?\u201d\n\u201cGo to the hospital,\u201d they said, \u201cif you are not afraid.\u201d\nSo, Zhenia went, calling after me: \u201cLet\u2019s go, they need people there.\u201d\nWhat am I going to say, \u201cno\u201d?\nOn the way to the hospital, we found a pharmacy, which was closed. We stocked up on morphine for the wounded, anti-inflammatory products, some insulin, all needed in the war zone, not your typical over-the-counter stuff. Zhenia knew where to look. We took everything and dragged the bags to the hospital.\nThe wounded people whose buildings were bombed were in the hospital basement. The hospital itself was pretty much no longer there: no windows, no wards.\nThose who were still alive were sitting next to the half-dead. Nobody had water. The air smelled like dried dirty blood and something burned. Half the people were whimpering, half were screaming for help. But nobody could help because there was nothing to help with!\nPhoto: mariupolnow\nOne man had his face torn from his skull. They simply put it back with staples, like a staple gun. He was sitting and smoking. The doctor came up to him. I thought he was going to say \u201cno smoking allowed here,\u201d but he asked for a cigarette instead.\nMy neighbor, the schoolteacher, didn\u2019t make it. The hospital didn\u2019t have supplies for general anesthesia, only local was done. Her heart couldn\u2019t handle it.\nHer daughter stayed with the body for three days afterward because of the nonstop airstrikes. She simply couldn\u2019t return home.\nZhenia and I went to the surgery unit. No one was asking for my credentials anymore.\n\u201cAre you afraid of blood?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\nWe changed our clothes and started bandaging wounds. I was checking the injured in, disinfecting the wounds with Betadine, assessing the damage, and assisting the surgeon with cutting the old casts, cleaning up the wounds, getting out shrapnel.\nAmidst all the work, we forgot about curfew. When we came out of the hospital, Russian soldiers were outside. They told us we weren\u2019t allowed to go anywhere.\nPhoto: mariupolnow\nWe were in a state of shock. Zhenia has a wife and a child at home, and I had my entire family waiting for me. We knew they\u2019d all lose their heads with worry.\nSo, we took a chance: dropping our jackets in -10\u00b0C weather, leaving white scrubs and gloves on, waving first aid kit and white kerchiefs in our hands, we ran 500 meters, hoping we wouldn\u2019t get shot.\nWhen we saw the soldiers, we fell on the ground yelling, \u201cWe are doctors, please don\u2019t shoot!\u201d\n\u201cAlright, move along.\u201d\nThis is how we ran back through the district where everything was still on fire, with house pets left behind screaming from buildings that had stopped burning and stood like lifeless boxes.\nLies\nLooking at burning Mariupol, we thought: If we got hit this bad, it means that Kyiv is no more, and Ukraine is no more. Old folks\u2019 radios were catching only Russian stations. They were saying all is well in Mariupol, and that most civilians were evacuated. This was not true!\nThe biggest lie of all was that the earlier bombed maternity hospital had no women in it. It did. Pregnant women and women giving birth. They had their legs blown off because they couldn\u2019t run out fast enough.\nSoon, we learned about a cellphone connection by the Kyivstar building in the city center. A huge crowd gathered there.\nI went with my pregnant sister. She is not very mobile, can\u2019t quickly drop to the ground and cover her head. We went carefully, ran a bit here and there. Then soldiers opened fire in the center. We hid under the stairs, and stayed there for three hours, in the frost, before the shooting quieted down some.\nPhoto: Gurskaya Valeriya\nAll we learned was that the mayor requested a cease-fire so that rescue teams could work and fix the damages in two days. But we understood that no one was left in the city to fix anything, and very possibly were all dead.\nOn the road\nAt some point, one of the Russian soldiers noticed my pregnant sister and warned us, \u2018\u2018You\u2019d better leave the city.\u201d\nPhoto: Demenkova Anastasiia\nSo, we learned of a humanitarian corridor and left two days later. But those who stayed were trapped in the grinder because Russian soldiers never stopped shooting and bombing the city.\nEvacuation was simpler for us than for others. When people noticed that my sister was about to give birth any moment, they often allowed us to skip lines.\nTo get to Zaporizhzhia, we had to go through the checkpoint in Berdiansk \u2014 which was temporarily occupied by the Russian army.\n\u2018Where are you going?\u2019 They asked.\n\u201cVasilyevka,\u201d we answered. Because if we said Zaporizhzhia, no one would let us out. Russian soldiers were telling us that if we were going to Zaporizhzhia, the Ukrainian army would shoot us there.\nWe didn\u2019t believe it, took a risk. From Vasilyevka, Ukrainian soldiers picked us and others up in organized columns.\nPhoto: Valeriya Gurskaya\nOur online friends and acquaintances helped us out in Dnipro. The man who gave us his apartment went to stay with his friends for three days, letting us use his place.\nAs we were driving through Ukraine and people learned we\u2019d come from Mariupol, their faces turned white, eyes wide open. Those who\u2019d evacuated Mariupol were considered an anomaly, ghosts who\u2019d lived through hell.\nAfterward\nAfter living through what we\u2019ve lived through, I realize that no one in our family is in the right psychological state. We are constantly yelling, turned into something wild.\nIf we see bread in the store, we have to get it. Any shot, bang, or a siren, and I can\u2019t breathe, I keep thinking: The window is here, I need to drop over there.\nYou can\u2019t heal from that in a year \u2014 or even two, or three. We are going to die with this trauma; it\u2019s a part of our DNA now.\nYour priorities change at a snap of a finger. Everything you were running after half your life is now worth nothing. I dropped everything and left. My husband just told me, \u201cGod, how happy I am, that you are alive and didn\u2019t get hurt.\u201d\nThe first thing I ate was bread. I drink water like it\u2019s going out of style and I still can\u2019t get enough of it.\nPhoto: Demenkova Anastasiia\nLegacy\nWhen we came through the big cities, we looked for maternity hospitals right away. Vinnytsia has many prenatal centers. Staying in town overnight, we were supposed to leave for Lviv in the morning.\nBut at 4:00 a.m., our plans changed quickly; we called a cab and rode to the maternity hospital. I started looking for a place to live in Vinnytsia and found a really nice flat: The owner had left to see her mother in the Czech Republic and left me the keys.\nPhoto: Gurskaya Valeriya\nThe first words out of my father\u2019s mouth were, \u201cthe sixth floor and too many windows, it\u2019s not safe.\u201d\nAt the maternity hospital, the doctors checked in my sister and did their job top-notch. Local authorities provided humanitarian aid for the baby: clothes, diapers, and such.\nVinnytsia accepted us beautifully. Right now, we need to see our husbands. They will have to get to us after being out at sea. My niece will get stronger, and then we will be on our way. But where? Who needs us?\nIn Ukraine, everybody helps everybody. We are so strong in spirit that we are ready to give the shirt off our backs to one another. Who needs us abroad?\nI don\u2019t know how we are supposed to live now, and how long we have. But if there is a chance to leave a legacy after we\u2019re gone, I\u2019m taking it. Even if it\u2019s just a digital legacy. The internet will keep it forever. That digital footprint will keep a part of my soul, my family, and the people who lived through it all, and those who didn\u2019t.\nPhoto: mariupolnow\nThen no one will ever forget about them.", "comment_count": 61, "like_count": 5598, "created_time": 1648670543010, "comment": [{"user_id": "976c2683a6ba", "comment_time": 1648670543010, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "e06d2e754f45", "comment_time": 1649344203756, "comment": "You are so brave!

Far from it.\nEspecially in today\u2019s tight labor market, amid the Big Quit, where businesses struggle to fill job openings, the best employees have more power than they might realize. Good companies and smart bosses always want talented, engaged, self-motivated, empowered employees who like their jobs and will stick around for the long haul, helping the company avoid the considerable costs and uncertainties of hiring and training replacements. Now, with more people choosing not to work or being more selective about their job choices, all while inflation is cutting into the real value of paychecks, U.S. analysts expect a period of outsized wage and salary hikes. This year could see the largest overall pay increases since 2008.\nSome workers will get bigger pieces of that larger pay pie. So how can you position yourself to benefit from this opportunity?\nFrom my 30-plus years of experience as a manager and executive in private, non-union companies, I\u2019ve gained considerable insight into the minds of the muckety-mucks who determine your fate and how to get what you want out of them.\nBut it\u2019s not easy.\nWomen, in particular, face unique challenges when negotiating for a raise, promotion or other compensation, says Kathryn Valentine, founder of Worthmore Strategies, which helps women navigate their negotiations. Whereas men may negotiate aggressively on their own behalf, a similar approach by women can generate a backlash rooted in the discomfort and fear felt by their male boss, Valentine says in an insightful interview published on Protocol. She suggests women take a negotiation training course, noting that LeanIn.org offers free options.\nI agree. And that in mind, what follows aims to acknowledge the many challenges of advocating for yourself while recognizing that there are good bosses and awful bosses, and you\u2019ll need to consider your individual situation when managing your boss.\nBe indispensable\nIt all starts with this. In hiring hundreds of people over the years and working hard to retain them, the \u21161 trait I valued was not mere skill or hard work but a broad mix of qualities that makes one person indispensable, another replaceable. There\u2019s no recipe for this, but here are the ingredients:\nWork hard and enjoy what you do.\nRelish responsibility and jump in to help whenever needed.\nKnow your job and stay educated about changes in the field.\nAim to be the best you can be, of course, but be humble about it.\nBe a positive, productive team member and help your colleagues succeed.\nCommunicate well up, down and across the chain.\nIf you\u2019re not sure how you rank on each of these necessary traits, ask your boss. Neither of you should be afraid of an honest, constructive discussion about your strengths and weaknesses. We all have a bunch of them.\nTake on the mundane tasks\nIf ever an employee wanted to raise my ire, the quickest way was to groan over doing the simple, sometimes boring tasks that are often foundational to a business \u2014 stuff they view as beneath them. I\u2019ll take respectful dedication over ego every single time.\nWhen I was a newspaper graphics editor and manager back in the 1990s, we were the pride of the paper, cranking out informative, colorful infographics that only well-trained visual journalists could produce. We were proud of the value we created for the paper and our role in informing the public. None of us wanted to do the tedious and uncreative locator maps that were needed daily. So we all shared that duty on an informal rotational basis \u2014 even my boss, who headed up the entire art and design team and could have justified not getting his hands dirty, did his share.\nWhether you\u2019ve just been hired or you\u2019ve been with a company for years, jump at the chance to take out the trash or clean the dishes in the break room or train a newbie. And don\u2019t look for a blue ribbon or a gold star. Just do the work. It\u2019ll be noticed.\nSpeak up and be honest\nYou don\u2019t want your boss to lie to you or withhold information that would help you do your job. Likewise, if you know something that would help you get work done more efficiently or otherwise benefit the company, say so.\nIt was very frustrating to me as a boss to uncover a problem or opportunity months after someone else spotted it but was reluctant to speak up. You were hired not just to perform a set of routine tasks but also to think, provide input, and speak the truth.\nIf you don\u2019t think your boss wants to hear your ideas, ask yourself if you\u2019ve really tried, and if you\u2019ve been insistent.\nFrom middle management on up, bosses spend a lot of time pretending they know what they\u2019re doing so that everyone else will perceive them as competent. In reality, a boss might be good at some things, not so good at others \u2014 just like you and me. Never does any given boss have all the good ideas. Always should a good boss want to hear good ideas, wherever they come from.\nComplain considerately\nYou\u2019ve heard it before: \u201cDon\u2019t come to me with a problem, come with a solution.\u201d That\u2019s rarely easy, often not even the best advice, as it can leave serious problems buried for no good reason. But give the notion some thought before you spout your complaint. If you can\u2019t come up with a solution, try to frame the issue as \u201ca challenge I need help solving\u201d instead of \u201cthis big dumbass nightmare that has my blood boiling.\u201d\nGood bosses welcome considerate questions, courteous suggestions and constructive criticisms. Consistent pissing and moaning leads to bosses and also colleagues dismissing you, rendering your voice moot.\nHowever, it can be hard for each of us to know if our approach to problem solving and communication leans positive or negative. Our sense of self doesn\u2019t always match what others perceive. Ask a spouse or sibling or trusted long-time work colleague if you generally approach problem-solving in a constructive or annoying manner. They\u2019ll know.\nDon\u2019t go around your boss (unless you have to)\nBosses expect their employees to work with them, not go around them, a course of action that can quickly sour relationships all around. It\u2019s not just about the formal hierarchy but about interpersonal relationships and trust. A good boss will listen to your ideas and suggestions, your challenges and grievances, and help you develop the good or work through the bad, or at least be honest and explain why something isn\u2019t likely to happen.\nExpect this support. When you don\u2019t get it, confront said boss, privately and respectfully, and make sure communication is ample and clear in both directions. Make your case not just from a personal perspective but in terms of how it matters to your boss, to the team, to the entire company. If you still feel stymied, see what your co-workers say about the situation. Maybe you are the obstacle. Put on your thick skin and seek some constructive criticism \u2014 you\u2019ll grow.\nBut if the boss is a jerk and you\u2019re mad as hell and just can\u2019t take it anymore, then, by all means, take the issue to a higher authority.\nPut yourself in their shoes\nYou might think your managers or the bosses above them are cold-hearted, calculating, unemotional. Could be. But they are human, too.\nYou don\u2019t have to fully understand the higher-ups\u2019 jobs or personal lives to appreciate that they are under pressure to perform, meet goals and demands often set by the next person up the chain or the board members or investors. Just like you, most of them have incomplete skill sets, want to do a good job and enjoy their work, hope to head out at a reasonable hour and take an occasional day off, maybe find some joy in life. If you fail to consider this reality, your engagements with management will suffer, as will your standing in the company.\nEmpathy and understanding run both ways: The more you give, the more you\u2019ll get.\nDon\u2019t apologize unless you mean it\nSome people never say they\u2019re sorry. Others apologize habitually, at any hint of criticism, constructive or otherwise. Neither approach is healthy in the workplace.\nOne of my most dedicated employees used to say \u201csorry\u201d regularly, several times a day. It came off as a lack of self-confidence, and I felt it was holding them back in the company. So I pointed it out, and they were grateful \u2014 didn\u2019t even realize they were doing it.\nIf you fuck up royally, apologize. But if a project turns out less than perfect, and you\u2019re doing your best (or the blame belongs elsewhere), just acknowledge the issue, then fix it if you can, or move on if you can\u2019t. Rather than say you\u2019re sorry, express some modest gratitude and forward-thinking optimism, as in, \u201cThanks, I\u2019ll fix that\u201d or \u201cGood point. We can do better next time.\u201d.\nNow that you\u2019ve made yourself a model employee, a shining example of skill, effort, teamwork, communication and understanding, you can advocate for your due. Success requires patience, thoughtfulness and all the skills of communication and understanding I mentioned above.\nSeek that promotion\nI sometimes knew who on my team was most eager to take on new responsibilities. Some employees wear their career desires on their sleeves. Others are less obvious about it, more prone to rolling their sleeves up and letting the work speak for itself.\nBosses can\u2019t read minds.\nIt\u2019s perfectly OK to let your boss know what you see your future self doing. Good bosses will ask now and then (at least once a year). If they don\u2019t, ask for a meeting to discuss your future. You don\u2019t need to make a hard sell. Just let your boss know that you love what you do, but you\u2019re aiming to grow, to take on new challenges and opportunities, that you\u2019d like to learn any new skills they think you might need to qualify.\nIf there\u2019s a particular role you see for yourself, say so. Don\u2019t wait for a job to be opened and filled while you grumble that nobody thought of you.\nBeing frank about your aspirations has an added benefit: It alerts your boss to the possibility that she\u2019ll lose you to a competitor if you\u2019re not given opportunities to grow.\nAsk for the pay you deserve\nIf you deserve a raise, frame your request smartly and politely. Don\u2019t base it on your sick spouse or your unpaid bills. This is about your performance, your value to the company, and what\u2019s fair in the marketplace. Only a jackass of a boss will be offended that you\u2019ve presented your case, and the worst thing that can happen is you\u2019ll be denied.\nNotice I did not suggest demanding a raise. If you demand it, have an exit strategy because it\u2019ll put your employer on their heels and could result in bad juju all around, regardless of the outcome (this is especially true for women, as Valentine notes).\nBut do ask for what you think is fair. The hard part is to know what you\u2019re worth, based on comparisons to similar jobs within and outside your company, as well as your particular skill and value. Glassdoor is one place to start, offering salary information for many industries and job positions. Asking trusted coworkers about their pay is another option.\nMost bosses hope workers won\u2019t share their salary information because there may be compensation inequities based on talent, experience, need, timing and other factors. But some workers are willing nonetheless to share what they make with their coworkers.\nIf you have no luck on this front, it\u2019s not inappropriate to ask your boss something like this: \u201cDo I make as much as so-and-so, who does the same job and has less experience?\u201d You might or might not get a straight answer, but you\u2019ll have planted a seed that just might sprout.\nA caution: Give your boss some time. Often, raises are linked to annual budget processes, though exceptions may be made for unusual circumstances. A company\u2019s budget might build in some wiggle room to make unexpected raises during the year, but this can depend significantly on current company finances. A little patience may prove rewarding in the long run.\nTake the time off that\u2019s promised you\nEvery company should have written policies on vacations and personal time off (PTO). Many companies, or individual bosses, have unstated expectations that are far less generous than the stated policies.\nSure, your boss might roll his eyes when you tell him you\u2019re scheduling a vacation, taking a personal day, or leaving an hour early for life-saving surgery. That is his problem, not yours.\nIf your company does not fully embrace the need for its people to rest and rejuvenate, take the time anyway and use it to look for another job. Speaking of which\u2026\nLook around\nIf you have aspirations beyond your current job status, it\u2019s important to recognize what\u2019s possible at your company. A smaller business, or a large one that\u2019s stalled out or in decline, may simply not have the financial resources nor the advancement opportunities to suit your goals.\nPlus, there\u2019s this cold hard fact: Your employer may seem highly devoted to you now, and that\u2019s a wonderful thing. But that devotion can evaporate with a changing business climate, like thunderstorm rain off hot summer blacktop.\nYou have no more obligation to your current employer than they have to you. That\u2019s the blessing and the curse of the American Way.\nSo while you make all the smart moves to be a valuable employee and achieve your goals within the company you\u2019re at, keep your eyes wide open elsewhere. A good boss will hate to lose you but will celebrate your new opportunity, one they apparently could not provide.\nThe writer has managed at many levels in manufacturing and media businesses, and spent a few years in a C-suite.

Fortunately, science has found several best practices that can help give us the best chance of living longer and staying physically and mentally well \u2014 behaviors with benefits that accrue whether you embrace them when you\u2019re young or old.\nA new study puts some compelling numbers to the mental side of the equation, showing that a few key lifestyle factors are linked not only to longer life but also more years without Alzheimer\u2019s disease, the most common form of dementia.\nThe research, using data from 2,449 people 65 and older in the United States who had no history of dementia when they joined the study, asked whether participants do these five things or not:\nGet 150 minutes (2.5 hours) or more of physical activity per week, whether formal exercise or simply walking or doing yard work\nEat a diet rich in whole grains, green leafy vegetables and berries and low in fast/fried food, and red meats\nStimulate the mind with activities like reading, visiting museums, or doing crosswords or puzzles\nKeep alcohol consumption at low to moderate levels or less\nAvoid smoking\nPeople got 1 point for engaging in each of these health-positive activities. Those who scored 4 or 5 were deemed to have the healthiest lifestyles, and those who scored 1 or 2 were considered to have the least healthy lifestyles. Follow-up tests for dementia and other conditions were performed for 18 years.\nHours gained\nThe findings are two-fold:\nYears of remaining life expectancy among the healthiest-lifestyle group, starting at age 65, were 24.2 years for women and 23.1 years for men, compared with 21.1 and 17.4 years for the least healthy women and men.\nThe least healthy people could expect to spend a significant amount of their remaining time dealing with Alzheimer\u2019s disease \u2014 4.1 years for women and 2.1 for men. The most healthy women and men would not only have more years of life expectancy but would spend less of it dealing with Alzheimer\u2019s disease \u2014 2.6 years for women and 1.4 for men.\n\u201cA healthy lifestyle was associated with a longer life expectancy among men and women, and they lived a larger proportion of their remaining years without Alzheimer\u2019s dementia,\u201d the researchers conclude in their study paper.\nIndeed, on a percentage basis, those with the healthiest lifestyles spent notably less of their remaining years suffering Alzheimer\u2019s compared to the least-healthy group:\nWomen: 10.8% vs. 19.3%\nMen: 6.1% vs. 12.0%\nThe findings are detailed today in the British Medical Journal (BMJ)\nHabits worth adopting at any age\nThe study cannot prove cause-and-effect. Among its limitations: Self-reporting of lifestyle habits is not always accurate. Also, the questionnaires did not determine whether study participants had adopted the lifestyle factors recently or if they\u2019d adhered to them for years, says study leader Klodian Dhana, MD, an assistant professor of medicine at Rush Medical College in Chicago. It\u2019s therefore not possible to conclude, from this study, whether a person gains more benefit by choosing healthy behaviors as a young adult or in middle age, versus waiting until later in life, Dhana tells me.\nBut the findings add to other evidence that dementia is not inevitable, and for many people, there are proactive ways to delay or prevent its onset. And the sooner one adopts healthy strategies, the better: Poor health in middle age more than doubles a person\u2019s chances of getting dementia later on.\nNo surprise, the best strategies for improving brain health, according to much research, mirror the behaviors highlighted by Dhana and his colleague:\nGet more physical activity\nImprove diet\nKeep the mind active\nAvoid alcohol\nAvoid smoking\nThe new research matters not just to you and me, but to society more broadly, writes HwaJung Choi, PhD, an assistant professor of internal medicine at the University of Michigan, in an accompanying editorial in the journal.\n\u201cThese findings have important implications for the wellbeing of aging populations and for related public health policies and programs,\u201d says Choi, who was not involved in the research. \u201cAlzheimer\u2019s disease and other dementias are among the most expensive health conditions both economically and socially, having a profound impact on those with dementia, their families, and wider society.\u201d\nKnowing the statistics is one thing.

But a new report takes a stab at the pain problem by reviewing 357 studies on \u201cheadache disorders,\u201d a range of headache types that recur, as opposed to the rare or occasional variety you might get, say, with the flu or a single particularly bad day.\nHere\u2019s the percentage of people globally who suffer one of these conditions in a given year:\n14%: Migraine\n26%: Tension headache\n52%: Any sort of headache disorder\nThe findings are detailed in the Journal of Headache and Pain.\nThe problem may be growing\nSome previous studies have suggested the prevalence of headaches are increasing, but the findings have not been conclusive.\nHowever\u2026\nToday, and on any given day, roughly 1.2 billion people around the world are dealing with a headache, nearly half of them suffering migraines, according to the new review. Migraines are more common in women (17%) than men (9%).\nIn addition, nearly 5% of people deal with headaches 15 or more days a month. Such extreme frequency is also more common in women (6%) than men (3%).\n\u201cThe data does suggest that headaches and migraine rates may be increasing,\u201d says study leader Lars Jacob Stovner, PhD, a professor of neurology at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. But because the hundreds of studies his team reviewed use different methods, and global data on the topic is far from complete, it\u2019s not possible to say for sure.\nCauses and remedies\nThere are more than 150 types of headaches. They share two common aspects: The pain owes to signals sent to the brain from blood vessels and nerves; and nobody knows exactly how or why these signals are generated. Headaches are often an inherited problem. But there are many other possible causes. Here are just a few:\nStress\nPoor sleep\nDepression\nStrong perfume\nBright lights\nAllergens\nAlcohol\nSmoke\nNoise\nThough recurring headaches and particularly migraines can prove difficult to alleviate, treatment for most headache types is not always as impossible as some might think. But it\u2019s important to first get a professional diagnosis of the type a person suffers and explore possible causes. Treatment options can vary significantly, according to the Mayo Clinic and Stanford University. For example, possible treatments for migraines include\u2026\nRest in a dark, quiet room\nHot or cold compresses\nAntidepressants\nMassage\n\u2026 while possible treatments for tension headaches include\u2026\nPhysical therapy\nMuscle relaxants\nIbuprofen, aspirin, or other pain relievers\nCognitive-behavioral therapy\nIf you experience a new or unfamiliar type of headache, or have other simultaneous symptoms like dizziness, confusion, vision changes or worse, see a physician immediately, experts advise. Sudden onset of a headache, sans other symptoms, can be an urgent red flag.\nThough people tend to have fewer headaches as they get older, there\u2019s an unfortunate flip-side: The risk that a sudden-onset headache portends death \u2014 typically because the headache is a symptom of some serious underlying condition \u2014 is 10 times higher in people 65 and older compared to younger adults.\nYour support makes my health reporting and writing possible, including succinct news briefs like this one as well as weekly features.

George Roy Hill\nDiane Lane and I are about the same age. So when I was 16 and she was 15 and saw her debut on the big screen in A Little Romance, I had a crush. Lane was the Natalie Portman of her time \u2014 her debut character precocious and adorable, and that character became her.\nI wasn\u2019t a creepy fan; I didn\u2019t write her or anything. I was just a fan \u2014 always happy to see her show up in things. In her twenties, her career was spotty, but her Lauren character always had me.\nA decade later, the [CMX 6000] editing system I was helping introduce to Hollywood was going to be used on a massive miniseries called Lonesome Dove. The project, produced by CBS and Motown Records, was going to be four 2-hour episodes, shooting on locations in Texas and New Mexico, and editing on location. This was no small task.\nThis was going to be four simultaneous feature-film-sized projects. A million feet of film. The CMX 6000 had cut TV shows and even some low budget features shooting 200,000 feet of film perhaps, but not 5x that \u2014 all of which had to be transferred from film to video and then from video to laserdiscs, in 30 minute chunks. Usually the editing systems were installed in air-conditioned facilities in Hollywood where it was easy to keep an eye on things, not sketchy hotels in the old west. Lonesome Dove was going to be shot on location, the film shipped to LA to get developed and transferred to 4 custom discs each day, and sent from LA back to the production as it moved around the countryside.\nThe editing system was the size of a small room \u2014 a desk-sized computer connected to a few monitors and 12 pairs of modified laserdisc players. That\u2019s a lot of fragile analog equipment that has to work perfectly for months while being moved around, connected disconnected reconnected.\nOkay, first of all, this was clearly going to be a project from hell. No one should have embarked on this insanity. But it was also a high-profile, well-funded project and while it was a push, it would be a big win for the product if it pulled through. We rolled the dice.\nNews was that the cast and crew and editing system would all be together to start with, taking over a few floors of the Radisson hotel in Austin, Texas, the primary location for the first month. There would be a couple moves \u2014 from Austin to Del Rio, Texas (on the border) and then on to Santa Fe, NM for the balance. The cast headliners were Robert Duvall, Tommy Lee Jones, and Danny Glover, but the rest of the cast were stellar as well, including Angelica Huston, Chris Cooper and Diane Lane.\nCall & Gus, \u00a9 1988, Bill Wittliff Courtesy of the Wittliff Collections, Texas State University. Wittliff was the screenwriter and active on location.\nWait, Diane Lane is in this? And we\u2019re all living together in a hotel? Things can get pretty rowdy when a production is spending a month in a hotel. I was suddenly less concerned about the risks involved.\nLaserdiscs and laserdisc players were fragile; there were micro-tolerances between the laser head and the spinning disc, and if something went wrong, the head could hit the disc, ruin the disc and player. This happened occasionally and was very bad \u2014 the cost to a production in terms of dollars and time was high. Pressures on film productions are high anyway, you don\u2019t need that kind of screw up; it was a tense place to have experimental technological products. Suzanne DePasse, the executive producer (and Motown rockstar, best known for discovering the Jackson 5), was looking cautiously over the shoulders of the editor and the post production team, and they were looking at me. The editor and assistants were using a persnickety device with a lot riding on it.\nMe with the CMX 6000 (1988)\nThe first scene shot included newbie actor Steve Buscemi riding in a wagon and getting scalped. He came by and introduced himself. The actors weren\u2019t supposed to, but sometimes they\u2019d pop into editorial to see how \u201cthings were going\u201d which was sorta code to see how their footage was looking. The key actors in the film didn\u2019t seem to hang out with us in post production, but the younger and newer actors were much happier to let us be part of the socializing that went on at the Radisson. Buscemi was in that group; DB Sweeny too. But most unusual was Rick Schroder. Rick arrived as Ricky, the child movie star who was having trouble aging up. Upon arriving at Lonesome Dove, Ricky asked everyone to now only call him \u201cRick\u201d \u2014 his 18th birthday was coming up in a few weeks and that\u2019s when it would be legal. Rick, Terry-the-assistant editor, and I became a functional social unit for awhile\u2014Rick was excellent at attracting attention. We went shopping for Nokonas and spent our evenings on 4th Street.\nI was familiar by then with the shooting schedule and I was sorry to see that Diane Lane\u2019s scenes didn\u2019t start until our last days in Austin. I was only going to be on the project until the editorial team felt comfortable with the workflow and everything was working as promised. It would be a mixed bag to still be around when Lane got to Austin. But perhaps I was worried for nothing.\nThere was already a problem with the discs that were arriving from LA. By the third day of cutting the discs were crashing into the laserdisc player heads \u2014 ruining both. It was an inauspicious start to the project. News of this got to Simon Wincer, the director. Before this project, Wincer had been directing TV in Australia, and was not well known in the US. (He\u2019d later get notoriety for directing Free Willy (1993)). Anyway, we tried to keep him from freaking.\nMore than half the discs were starting to crash. Upon close examination it looked like they were \u201cpuffing up\u201d a small degree, enough to close the gap to the head. The discs were manufactured by adhering the red-laser video data on the bottom of a plastic disc, and then sandwiching that with another clear disc to protect it. I had a theory that it had something to do with the change in humidity between Los Angeles and Austin, causing the two plastic parts to expand in different ways. To test this, I took a few sets of discs into the dry sauna at the Radisson. In short order the discs flattened out and the new directive was to install dehumidifiers in the editing areas. This was often what my job was like. The heroic story of sauna-ing with the movie\u2019s dailies got around quickly.\nBy the end of the month, once the project was stable and everyone was trained, I needed to rotate out to a new project and leave Lonesome Dove to my teammate Larry. On my last day in Austin I found myself sitting in the lobby, waiting for a table at the atrium restaurant after checking out. The front door to the hotel opened and Diane Lane walked in\u2026 and up to the lounge hostess. Being told it would be a 20 minute wait she sat down next to me.\nDiane Lane is sitting next to me.\nI could feel my heart pounding. I was afraid to look at her. We sat in silence for about 10 minutes. I couldn\u2019t move.\nWhen the hostess called my table I stood up\u2026and taking a deep breath, turned around to Lane\u2026 and asked her if she wanted to join me. I introduced myself. And she sweetly accepted. I don\u2019t remember what we ordered, and I don\u2019t remember what we said. I just remember sitting across the table from her and talking and smiling (and her charging it to her room) and me leaving the hotel that day, as happy as I\u2019d been in a long time; elegant closure. I still tend to think of this as \u201cmy date with Diane Lane.\u201d\nThere was a time I was disappointed that I had to leave that production; Lonesome Dove was a great success for everyone involved. Maybe the only saving grace was that Larry, who replaced me in Austin, met a woman that week who he fell in love with. He steadfastly refused to cycle out of Austin even when I volunteered to return a month later. Larry managed to stay through the project, moved to Austin, and eventually married Debbie. He\u2019s still married to her today. So it\u2019s all good.

Uelsmann\nWhat I Learned From This Playful and Pioneering Photographer\nUelsmann at home, (Rubin 2018)\nUelsmann passed away this week; photographers and creatives worldwide are mourning. Carol McCusker, the curator of photography at the Harn Museum, wrote this of Uelsmann:\nUelsmann came of age in the 1960s which informed his art, a period of resisting the status quo. He joyfully challenged and expanded traditional notions of the camera as a singular, objective recording device. He was among the first of his generation to do so, and occasionally encountered controversy from those who valued documentary photography as the essential agent of change in an age rife with conflict.\nThrough his liberated sensibilities, photography became a tool of self-expression and exploration by combining multiple negatives (he had seven enlargers in his darkroom which he often used to make one print), thereby reinventing realities that evoke memory, spirit, and desire through his meticulously printed, signature black and white aesthetic. With imagination and wit, he turned landscapes into conundrums, reveled in the poetry of the human body, and re-imagined reality altogether.\nFor as long as I can remember, his photographs lined the walls of our home. With prints like Small Woods Where I Met Myself and Apocalypse II displayed near my bedroom, it\u2019s a wonder I turned out even remotely normal. No little blue elephants by my crib. It was more like this:\nUelsmann\u2019s Apocalypse II (1967) was just one of the relatively creepy images that haunted my childhood.\nI\u2019ve spent the morning thinking about all the ways he influenced me. In one way or another he\u2019s been part of my life since I was an infant. His mom was my babysitter and it was she who connected Jerry and his wife to my parents. At the time I knew nothing of photography, but his images were ubiquitous and haunting; and our family\u2019s frequent journeys to his home on the edge of town was an early powerful influence.\nJerry Uelsmann was all about juxtaposition. In his photos and in his home. His house was its own sort of collage. A visual feast for a kid. First, there were the types of things he collected \u2014 angels, alligators, cameras, hamburgers, figurines, stuffed animals, buttons, a host of antiques\u2026 But they were scattered around, and mixed up together and no matter where you looked there was some level of curiosity and detail. As a little kid I gravitated to a turn-of-the-century gum dispenser with a little man on a bicycle riding in a loop before depositing your stale gum. I loved messing around with his player piano. My brother recalls a box of percussive musical instruments he\u2019d pull out and let us play. I was fascinated with the plush moose head on the wall, almost a cartoon, with a hat and a couple cameras around his neck. There were always fun things to discover.\n\nUelsmann\u2019s workspaces in 2018. I used these to rationalize not cleaning my room as a kid. And it became exactly how I would decorate as an adult.\nAnd then of course there were the photographs. Some by him. Many by his friends and mentors \u2014 Weston\u2019s Pepper 30, Kertesz\u2019 Satyric Dancer. And maybe the weirdest, rarest thing I had ever seen \u2014 he had a print of Ansel Adams\u2019 Moonrise, framed, but ripped in half! He had half a Moonrise! (How cool is that?) The last time I visited him he pulled out a little package he had once received from Imogen Cunningham: it was some beautiful dried leaves that she was sending for him to include in his montages.\n\nA 1970 letter from Imogen Cunningham\u2026\nI noticed her address was a few blocks from where I then-lived in San Francisco. Uelsmann was anointed by Adams and Cunningham as an \u201cofficial West Coast photographer,\u201d and the photo by Ted Orland (Ansel\u2019s assistant) always made us laugh.\nAt left, half a Moonrise\u2026\nThis delightful and humorous way he decorated carried into his photos \u2014 not usually laugh-outloud funny (like perhaps Elliot Erwitt), but deep-smiles, sweet, silly. Hot Dog Trip. Little Hamburger Tree. With Jerry, photos were fun.\n\nUelsmann\u2019s Little Hamburger Tree (1970) was so simple and yet always delightful. What\u2019s missing here is a sense of just how small and adorable the print is \u2014 on silvery paper and tiny! His Untitled nude (1977) went up in our home when I was starting high school and I spent hours with it. For me it started a fascination with the body \u2014 and a focus on just how minimal a line or shadow can be to imbue the rock with sensuality.\nUelsmann and Adams were two sides of the same coin and they knew it. Where Adams was all about pure seeing, careful preparation and exposures, what he called \u201cpre visualization\u201d \u2014 Uelsmann was all magic and myth, his images created in the darkroom. He jokingly referred to it as \u201cpost visualization.\u201d And yet they were both darkroom masters, and in spite of those superficial differences, they both saw photography as an artistic creation, separate from objective reality, and both ultimately built their works in the darkroom through extraordinary efforts in the printing. Adams referred to his photos like music \u2014 he said his negatives were a score, but the print was the performance. This was even more true for Uelsmann. The intricate burning and dodging they both did was a dance, a unique performance for each print. So in spite of Uelsmann using multiple images for montage, they really weren\u2019t all that different.\nUelsmann taught my mother photography and he helped her build a darkroom in our house. Like any real Uelsmann darkroom, we had three enlargers \u2014 still less than half his set up, but enough to play. Which I did.\nThe darkroom in our home (1978), a few enlargers, and Uelsmann\u2019s prints on the wall. I spent most of high school in this windowless room.\nFor my first many years of taking pictures, I didn\u2019t think of photography in terms of shooting something, but rather collecting interesting elements and objects in a specific range of lighting conditions which lent themselves to various sorts of darkroom composition, which one would come up with later. At the time, the idea of taking a picture and then printing it as you shot it struck me as simplistic. I believe that this approach led me to appreciate how much of creative photography was about interesting juxtapositions. So even as I evolved into straight photography, I never let go that structural component, and I\u2019d see it repeated again and again in the funny shots by Elliot Erwitt and Henri Cartier-Bresson.\nUelsmann made me want to be a photographer. He made it look fun. But my father urged me to stick to photography as a personal, not professional, activity, and I landed in a technology career. But I never stopped shooting. As I watched digital imaging come of age, and the birth of Photoshop, I was uninterested in creating images this way and never took to digital compositing. In 2013 I even joined Adobe, but still I never got involved in the digital compositing of Photoshop. Uelsmann, too, never adopted that technology, and for his entire life stuck to his masterworks in the chemical darkroom. It never surprised me in the least.\nBoth my sister and I absorbed his aesthetic and it found its way not only into how we decorated our homes (\u201ccreative clutter\u201d) but in the art we\u2019d create. Her photo collages \u2014 made by cutting up photos and reassembling \u2014 was nothing if not post visualization. And my photographic \u201chaiku\u201d evolved from an understanding of both real life juxtapositions and the basic post production required to intensify those experiences. None would have been possible without Uelsmann\u2019s playful inspirations.\n\nMy sister, Gabrielle Israelievitch\u2019s montage \u201cYellow Taxi\u201d (1998); one of my collegiate darkroom composites \u201cSayles Beach\u201d (1982)\nUelsmann was an influence in so many ways; he got my parents to start collecting photographs \u2014 and introduced them to the masters of the day, which in the 1970s was still the folks who pioneered the artform. If that was all he had done for my family, it would have been enough. But he was also supportive of my explorations \u2014 and encouraged me to submit a portfolio when I was applying to college (and along with a letter of recommendation he wrote on my behalf, I\u2019m certain contributed to my acceptance).\nOver the decades I continued to see him on vacations, and he and my parents remained close. I always felt that Gainesville, Florida was an odd place to be from \u2014 our greatest claims to fame were Gatorade and Tom Petty \u2014 but for me nothing was ever as cool as growing up around Jerry Uelsmann. He made it okay to be a photographer and a bit cooler to be from Gainesville. He was the architect of my aesthetic and understanding of photography, something that consumes the entirety of my life these days. It\u2019s been a difficult week, but his photos still make me smile.\nFor my 19th birthday\u2026\nFrom today\u2019s Gainesville Sun: \u201cJerry Uelsmann, center, speaks to friend Mel Rubin after Uelsmann\u2019s presentation about his friendship with photographer Ansel Adams at the Harn Museum of Art.\u201d FILE/CHRISTINA STUART/THE GAINESVILLE SUN", "comment_count": 1, "like_count": 98, "created_time": 1649263828944, "comment": [{"user_id": "fa1cd8bc2afe", "comment_time": 1649263828944, "comment": "Thinking of Jerry N.

Rubin", "post_id": "e869088a5e8e", "user_id": "fa1cd8bc2afe", "title": "Seeing vs. Shooting", "content": "Seeing vs. Shooting\nRecognizing the Differences; Overcoming the Problems\nSelfie, 1981\nThe photographer Dorthea Langue once famously said \u201cA camera is a device that teaches you to see without a camera.\u201d I always loved this quotation. Once you get good at shooting, you start to see the world like a photographer \u2014 you notice things, you notice light, you look slower, you take pictures in your mind. The camera saves them, but even without one, you see differently.\nBut the converse breaks down; there are some important disparities between shooting and seeing, and not fully understanding them can lead to frustration and self-recrimination, thinking \u201cI\u2019m not any good at taking pictures.\u201d It\u2019s not true, you just need to come to grips with the differences \u2014 and when you do your photos should improve immediately.\nStopping Time\nYou look out at a breathtaking vista, sunlight scintillating on the lake or autumn leaves flitting in the breeze \u2014 and you take a picture\u2026 and upon examination, the photo just feels flat. Your eye is processing the delightful motion in a billion sparkles, but in freezing that motion, you see it\u2019s not the sparkles but the changing sparkles that is so delightful. This can be difficult to capture. I find this equally true with the magic in a snowfall or rainstorm \u2014 it\u2019s very tricky to capture the scene the way you experienced it because the magic is in the motion and depth.\n\nRain and snow: toying with shutter speed and depth of field to approximate the magic of seeing. Regardless of technique, it\u2019s different. (Rubin, 2016 and 2022)\nOnce you recognize that a still photo will never recreate motion the way you saw it, you have a few creative options. First is to slow down the shutter speed. You can get closer to the experience by allowing those moving objects to change while the picture is being taken. It will produce some blur or streaks and that is one way to feel the motion. It takes experimentation in the moment to determine how long a shutter speed to use, which of course depends on how fast the objects are moving and how far away you are from them, and ultimately, how steady you can be for how long. Snow is slower than rain.\nOf course it\u2019s always a game in photography \u2014 how long do you leave a shutter open \u2014 how much of a slice of time do you want to encapsulate? because as time increases the slice becomes a volume of time that you\u2019re flattening. Michael Kenna\u2019s gorgeous scenes are quiet and devoid of humanity in part because his shutter speed is slow, and thus the volume of time in the photo might be hours, freezing only those things that are unchanging.\nMichael Kenna, \u201cWanaka Lake Tree, Study 1, Otago, New Zealand,\u201d 2013\nBeginners in photography explore freezing a live moving 3D scene into a 2D slice, but where time is a variable. That\u2019s novel and weird. And fun.\nAt the other end of the spectrum, you stop time and the image looks very different from how our mind experiences a moving moment. A stopped raindrop is actually hard to see. So when something catches your eye, you also have to recognize what it is about this scene that makes you want to save it\u2014because it\u2019s often something about motion and time, and these are more difficult to save than light.\nBrain Ignoring Details\nThere\u2019s something wonderful about the human visual system, and how it scans a scene \u2014 called a saccade \u2014 stopping momentarily at one fixed point, then zipping to another, and sewing bits together into a seamless whole with imperfect and changing information.\nThe content that is not specifically picked up in this saccade is filled in by our brains \u2014 what fits with the rest of the fuzzy peripheral data we have, sometimes what we expect to see there.\nEye tracking software is big business today, where it\u2019s important to everyone from interface designers to advertisers very invested in where you look and for how long. You can tune into your own curiosity and what catches your eye, and train yourself to look around more.\nThis is made obvious when you take a picture \u2014 you might imagine its just a picture of that cool tree, but your brain is ignoring lots of cluttering objects in the distance and foreground. The camera, on the other hand, doesn\u2019t ignore anything. What began in your head as an elegant image of a beautiful tree becomes a cluttered snapshot where the tree is hardly magical. It\u2019s an optical illusion.\nThe practice is training yourself to notice things inside your camera frame, and coming to understand how they\u2019ll look when shot with different settings.\nLeft vs Right Brain Seeing\nIn her book \u201cDrawing on the Right Side of the Brain\u201d artist Betty Edwards asks students to copy a line drawing of a guy in a chair. The drawings are horrible. Then she has them turn the drawing upside down and do it again. This time, the drawings are fantastic. It illustrates the way we process information: we don\u2019t draw what we are seeing, we\u2019re drawing what we know. If my brain sees an eye and nose, it tries to draw its iconic understanding of an eye and a nose, instead of drawing the light and dark right in front of my face. When the drawing to be copied is turned upside down, the brain doesn\u2019t recognize anything, and has no option but to draw the lines it sees. Which is in fact how artists draw.\nUpside-down Picasso drawing, from \u201cDrawing on the Right Side of the Brain\u201d\nPhotography has some similarities. When we look at the world, we often see things \u2014 nouns, collections of objects. We\u2019re seeing with the left logical side of our brains, and it makes photographic composition difficult. Photographers also learn to see with the right side of the brain, the side that doesn\u2019t see bounded things so much as noticing patterns of light and dark.\nWhile we can\u2019t turn our scenes upside down, it\u2019s possible to practice \u201cbeginner\u2019s mind\u201d (an idea from Zen Buddhism). It refers to having an attitude of openness and lack of preconceptions when studying a subject, even when studying at an advanced level, just as a beginner would.* (*from Wikipedia).\nComposition\nIn the real world, as you look around, you do not compose little vignettes out of the things before you. There is nothing natural in this activity.\nIf anything, when you look around, your brain is always creating a sort of internal 3D model of the spacial orientation of things around you. See the bowl on the table: as you move your head and all the objects move around in your visual field \u2014 your brain assembles all that data into a model. When I take a picture I\u2019m keenly aware that I have to pick a SINGLE vantage point, and from every vantage point I see a slightly different arrangement . By what criterion would I choose one over another?\nAnd now that I\u2019m looking at the bowl, which is the subject I\u2019m interested in, I notice there are reflections in the window on the other side of the room. That stuff doesn\u2019t interest me, but it should, it might be in the frame. As I put a frame around the bowl, thinking about how much context I want, or what various objects might mean in juxtaposition here. So I move a bit here and there and make decisions about having more of this in frame or less of that in frame.\nLenses and Perspective\nCartoon by Meg Adams (from Hertzmann, 2022)\nWe\u2019ve all had the experience of seeing something looming before us, snapping a photo, and that big object of our attention is rendered small in frame, way smaller than it felt in real life. This is an optical property of lenses and linear perspective. Adobe researcher Dr. Aaron Hertzmann has done some brilliant writing on this issue and fully outlines the problem. As he says, \u201cTheories of perception and photography often tend to be all-or-nothing. Either linear perspective and cameras are correct, and cameras don\u2019t lie. Or, there is no objective reality and everything is made-up. The reality is clearly far more complex. Our artwork employs all sorts of complex nonlinear structures, and our brains are able to understand and interpret them.\u201d\nSo barring new computational photography solutions, a photographer\u2019s best option is to experiment with lenses and focal length in the specific scene you\u2019re shooting and make the determinations in the moment of how to distort the view in a way that \u201cfeels\u201d most like what you want to portray. And it further supports the fact that all photography is an artistic creation, a function of the mood and intent of the photographer, and never an \u201cobjective\u201d reality.\nCandid Photographs\nIt happens to everyone: something great is going on and you go to take a picture and the moment ends. Pulling a camera out in social scene is going to change the situation before you, in a very Heisenberg-effected kind of way (which says that the very act of observation directly alters the phenomenon under investigation). Your pictures can feel stiff. To get around this effect, your observation needs to be limited: As much as cameras certainly change the moment, I believe there can be a short period when a camera arrives in view without causing much scene altering. If the camera stays out longer it has significantly more affect on people in front of it \u2014 feeling uncomfortable, feeling watched, or judged. You are invading the space you\u2019re in, simply by inserting a recording device in there.

And I brought 20 rolls of film \u2014 720 images in all \u2014 which was a lot in 1984. I felt like a pro, traveling with a \u201cbrick\u201d of Tri-X. When you shoot film you try hard not to waste frames; it\u2019s a natural force function that filters out some of the more idiotic shots you might take. Now, Mt. Rushmore is pretty much the classic thing to see as you\u2019re crossing South Dakota (that, and Wall Drug) and even though it\u2019s a hour diversion from the Interstate, I did it.\nWhen you\u2019re standing before Mt. Rushmore I promise you, it is virtually impossible \u2014 like a curse \u2014 not to point your camera at the four dudes and frame up a shot that looks like every postcard, every snapshot ever taken of the monument. I remember standing there and fighting the urge. I failed:\nTypical shot of the monument (Rubin, 1984) although i did try to use the window frames to make it more interesting or different\u2026\nBut once I shot that \u201cobvious\u201d shot, I was free to explore alternative approaches. What are constraints that limit me that aren\u2019t inherent in the scene? Can I get to another vantage point? Can this be shot in a fresh way? Do I even need all four presidents? The lessons of synecdoche reminded me that it doesn\u2019t take the full-frontal to make it clear this is Mt. Rushmore. In fact, it dawned on me that I had never really looked at the rock cliff from which the sculpture was carved. Shooting more rock and less face felt unique and satisfying. My exploration was simply how little of Lincoln did I need to include to signal this rocky cliff was at the edge of Rushmore.\n\nAnd so, the lesson\nDon\u2019t fight that desire to shoot the obvious shot, particularly if you\u2019re not on film. Digital photography makes the cost of exploration almost nil. My podcast co-host Suzanne Fritz-Hanson came up with a pithy way to describe the phenomenon: \u201cGet the clich\u00e9 out of the way.\u201d Once you\u2019ve shot that horrible, obvious, utterly unoriginal clich\u00e9, you are set free. Give yourself that gift.\nMuch of my personal photography is about shooting the most shot, most famous, most popular subjects in ways that feel fresh, personal, and unique. It\u2019s a high bar for myself and good practice. Whether shooting a flower, a monument, or a friend, I really can\u2019t start work until I take that first icky clich\u00e9, and then I can begin. So if you\u2019re like me and want to shoot more original-feeling images, don\u2019t beat yourself up if you still take the most unoriginal pictures of it. You have to start somewhere, and just settle on the fact that you\u2019re not done.\n\nCoit Tower, (at left) pretty much like most Coit Tower shots; and then later that night. (Rubin, 2015)\n\nNothing says \u201cParis\u201d like the Eiffel Tower; but once I got the more typical presentations out of the way, I was able to play around with more nuanced ways to include it.

It was the first of five we would share in the coming year, in the same place, in what felt like the same eternal moment, because we\u2019d lost all sense of time. With all of us working and learning at home, without our usual cues that the day had come and gone \u2014 a departure for work or school, an arrival back from the trenches \u2014 one day was much like any other.\nIn the first few weeks of shelter in place, hoarding instincts kicked in where we live. Told that masks were of no use but hands must be pristine, shoppers cleared the shelves of all hand sanitizers, rubbing alcohol, and soap. Although I could understand why people didn\u2019t normally keep buckets of hand sanitizer around, as I scanned the empty grocery shelves, I wondered why so many people had just discovered soap.\nIt\u2019s possible they were just stocking up with extras because the future was uncertain. No one knew how this would go, but a lot of people had a very bad feeling. The signs weren\u2019t good that we\u2019d have the political will for a competent federal response. By mid-March, it had become clear that we all were largely on our own. Suddenly, all the posts on my neighborhood\u2019s Nextdoor weren\u2019t about \u201ccoyote in yard\u201d (a common sight and a common post topic). Instead, they were about people, often elderly, having to go to four or five stores in a pandemic to find toilet paper. Sometimes they simply couldn\u2019t find any and were on Nextdoor to crowdsource some.\nHoping to avoid this situation in our household of five full-sized people, I ordered a box of business-sized rolls of toilet paper, like the kind you find in public bathrooms. Every time we completed a regular roll that we had on hand, I\u2019d collect the cardboard core. Then I\u2019d sit in the evenings, while our family rewatched comforting television shows, and wind toilet paper from these giant rolls around the regular-sized cores so they\u2019d fit on the bathroom holders. If we didn\u2019t use these handmade TP rolls, I reasoned, I could donate them to people who turned to Nextdoor in their need.\nWhat Everyone\u2019s Getting Wrong About the Toilet Paper Shortage\nIt isn\u2019t really about hoarding. And there isn\u2019t an easy fix.marker.medium.com\nA year later, those DIY rolls are sitting in a bag in a closet, unused. The shelves soon refilled, and that small crisis passed, so no one needed them after all. Perhaps the rolls will come in handy during the next disaster \u2014 power outages, fires, floods \u2014 that leads people inexplicably yet understandably to think first of toilet paper. Perhaps then, having plenty ourselves, I can give them to others who turn to Nextdoor for help.\nMeanwhile, a year has passed. Our oldest son is a college sophomore, our middle son is a high school senior, and our youngest is just wrapping up his freshman year of high school. They all were at home, we all were home, together, for 10 months nonstop. With great good fortune and privilege, we had the space and the temperamental consonance to spend this time together without interpersonal tension. If I, as a parent, could have asked for a gift, it would have been this gift of time with my children just as they turn their faces toward a future, separate and away from us.\nIt was an embarrassment of riches while the same gift was being ripped from hundreds of thousands of people because of political disregard for its preciousness. Time, like everything else in this lopsided society, became a treasure of the privileged while it was being stolen from those who could not avoid risk.\nIt was an embarrassment of riches while the same gift was being ripped from hundreds of thousands of people because of political disregard for its preciousness.\nAs our world seems to be getting its legs back under it, lurching toward some version of a \u201cnew normal\u201d with this stalking pathogen, millions of people have lost this treasure that should have been theirs to keep. We can hoard flour and water, toilet paper and hand sanitizer, but the one thing we cannot hoard is time. My sense of its passage during this surreal year was blunted even as I tried to sharpen it, even as I tried to embrace the ephemeral gift while it inexorably slipped away.\nWhen time passes, it is gone forever, but we can still hoard the memories. As days and months and years go by, I expect fragments of this personal bounty to take on clearer contours in my mind, standing out in relief against a backdrop of unimaginable, avoidable tragedy, one begetting the other, inseparably. I can\u2019t regain an entire year when time seemed to have no shape. But I can revisit the moments from that year and behold them, let myself feel them, and give them distinct, precious meaning that does honor to this humbling gift.", "comment_count": 5, "like_count": 372, "created_time": 1615414183365, "comment": [{"user_id": "eaa2f3defa7", "comment_time": 1615414183365, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "b901bf322339", "comment_time": 1615821151235, "comment": "This was one of the first \u201cthe world is upside down\u201d moments of the pandemic for me.

The authors say that if people met current threshold recommendations for physical activity, more than 10% of cases of depression might be prevented. Current recommendations are for 150 minutes a week of moderate-intensity physical activity, or a little more than 20 minutes a day.\nBut even moving from zero to just a little physical activity may offer benefit for some of us. The risk reduction seen in this study isn\u2019t tied to training for marathons \u2014 in fact, the decline is steepest with a low volume of activity compared with none. Risk stays lower with high levels of physical activity, too, but the risk decrease flattens out.\nAnother bit of good news is that the \u201cphysical activity\u201d here doesn\u2019t necessarily reference hopping on a treadmill or sweating through a high-intensity workout. The activities in these studies covered any kind of getting physical, including moving around a lot for work.\nPhysical activity boosts factors in our bodies that contribute to immune response, neural connections, and how our brains react to hormonal signals. These authors also highlight the social factor, which came up again and again in my research for my book, The Tailored Brain. I was on the lookout for which non-pharmaceutical brain-boosting interventions have the best evidence base, and physical activity, social interactions, and mindfulness practices handily dominated what I found.\nPhysical activity can make us feel better about ourselves and our self-image, which is one potential social effect. But when we engage in these activities with other people \u2014 such as through cooperative busyness during kitchen prep, chatting on a daily walk, or playing a game of pickup \u2014 we\u2019re doing more than moving our bodies. We are also offloading our mental burdens, sharing with others, freshening our connections, and airing out our thoughts. The result is that our mood and our minds can feel lighter.\nThe authors also mention the potential role for the outdoors and nature in these mood-modulating effects. Exposure to nature is associated with improved mood, and we do often engage in our physical activities in an outdoor setting.\nMaintaining mood at a level that feels healthiest may mean taking doses of many things, including friends, physical activity, the outdoors, and for some of us, anti-depressants or other medications. We can tailor our needs with these tools, relying on higher or lower doses or no doses at all, as suits us best.\nThe findings of this study reinforce other research suggesting that when it comes to physical activity, even a light dose \u2014 as we each interpret that for ourselves \u2014 may offer benefit for at least some of us.\nI am a science journalist and author of The Tailored Brain: From Ketamine, to Keto, to Companionship, A User\u2019s Guide to Feeling Better and Thinking Smarter (\u201cfantastic and timely,\u201d Salon) and of Phallacy: Life Lessons from the Animal Penis (which Pulitzer winner Ed Yong calls \u201ca hilarious tour through a menagerie of dicks, and a ferocious guide to not being a dick yourself\u201d).

The article looks at this care through a few lenses: medicine, mental health, politics, and the international landscape. My piece is grounded in science that is reinforced by clinical expertise and the stories of families under siege in Texas for caring for their children and affirming their gender identity.\nOne thing that stood out to me as I was reporting this story was how much \u201cgender affirmation\u201d reflects the \u201cyes\u2026and\u201d approach that we should take with children when they tell us who they are.\nWhen a child tells their parents that they are nonbinary or trans \u2014 whatever language they use to express it \u2014 a hugely important thing parents can do for that child\u2019s mental health and well-being is to say, \u201cYes, and we respect that. What we can we do to support you?\u201d Parents of children who express being cis and heterosexual seem to universally offer this affirmation unasked. Yet for other children, many parents do not respond this way and instead reply with a reflexive, \u201cno, but,\u201d or simply, \u201cno.\u201d This kind of response harms children in profound ways.\nParents respond with \u201cno, but\u201d and \u201cno\u201d in lots of other situations, too, from \u201cI don\u2019t like broccoli\u201d to \u201cthis shirt scratches me.\u201d Imagine you, a whole human, feeling this way about broccoli or itchy clothes and being told, \u201cNo, eat the broccoli\u201d or \u201cNo, wear the shirt\u201d by someone larger than you, someone whom you trusted to see and understand you.\nCan you remember being a child? How far back do your memories go? One category of recall is \u201cepisodic\u201d memories, the recollections that we can set in a specific time and place, with illustrative detail.\nDating these memories is easy for those of us who have younger siblings or lived in a lot of different places in our childhood. Instead of our early lives being a blur of sameness of surroundings and the people around us, we can pin them to locations and the changing cast of characters in our lives. Because of this, I can place my earliest clear memories to the early 1970s, before the birth of my next-younger sibling.\nBased on the clothes I was wearing (pajamas, with a coat over them), the activity I recall (building a snowman, quite unusual for being in Texas), and where we lived (Waco), I was probably about age 3 or 4. Before that, I have fuzzier recall, mostly related to the layout of homes I lived in, a bathtub full of bubbles, a huge swollen face from poison ivy exposure, a puppy, the color of wood on a porch.\nI bet that in reading this, you didn\u2019t feel much inclination to tell me that my memories were inaccurate, or my recall faulty. Why would you? They\u2019re my experiences and mine to recollect.\nBut what if I told you that also that during my pre-K years, I also knew that I liked boys \u2014 I recall especially one boy in pre-K named Freddie. I had a huge crush on Freddie (I don\u2019t think he reciprocated). Many people would accept this as fine, because it fits their priors. A little girl knows she likes boys. Big whoop.\nYet I also knew quite early on that I was not a \u201cnormal girl.\u201d I didn\u2019t want to do what the other girls did, I didn\u2019t have the same interests. For the first 17 years of my life, if I hadn\u2019t been aware of that difference myself, some of the other children around me \u2014 including at a boarding school my freshman year of high school \u2014 made it abundantly clear.\nI now know that, as I once tweeted, I feel like I live in two spaces. One is the space outside my head where I\u2019ve been treated as a girl and then a woman, and all that this perception entails. The other is the one inside my head where I am just\u2026being my brain, without any gendered valence.\nI just feel kind of neutral, or if anything, certainly leaning more toward what everyone during my childhood viewed as \u201cmasculine\u201d pursuits and interests. Today, I believe that would be called \u201cnonbinary,\u201d but in the 1970s and 1980s, I was just viewed (and felt) like I constantly had to interpret two worlds, neither of which I was especially fluid at understanding.\nAll of which is to say, we know who we are, and we know it early on. We recognize it in ourselves, and we also have this recognition imposed on us because the people around us see it, too. How they react can be formative, deformative, damaging, or uplifting.\nWhen a child tells you who they are, believe them. People change, sure. Are you exactly the same person you were when you were 5? Probably not. But what you were at 5, no matter who you are, was a person who needed love, acceptance, and affirmation of themselves as an individual, then, at that time and place.\nIf a child discloses something personal they feel or see in themselves, accept what they\u2019re saying with a \u201cyes, and\u201d and go from there. That\u2019s affirmative parenting. And it gives them something that children badly need from their parents \u2014 someone they can trust, who gives them the structure they need as they take the risks that growth and maturation require. That doesn\u2019t mean dispensing with routine, structure, or the expectations of mutually respectful communication that keep a family functioning as a healthy unit \u2014 in fact, it contributes to all of these needs through healthy modeling of what listening, empathy, acceptance, and unconditional love look like.*\nChildren are individuals from birth, and they deserve for their individuality and what they understand about themselves to be respected. When they express to their parents what they recognize about themselves \u2014 even if it\u2019s just \u201cI like strawberry better than chocolate\u201d (I know, I know \u2014 so hard to accept) \u2014 they are seeking affirmation. You say, \u201cyes, and\u201d and for their birthday, get them a strawberry instead of a chocolate cake. Why would you take a stand on forcing chocolate on them just because you think it\u2019s better or more \u201cnormal\u201d?\nChildren need this affirmation from the people they trust the most, or try to trust. When adults model this affirmation and show that they respect an individual\u2019s feelings, they are giving their child guidance and offering them the kind of structure all children need.* Parents and caregivers are (or should be) the safe places for young people as they explore the world, ports in a storm as they try broccoli for the first time or take other risks. Children need to know that no matter what they see in themselves or how they feel, if they disclose it, they still will be loved unconditionally. \u201cNo, but\u201d always carries conditions. \u201cYes, and\u201d does not.\nI am a science journalist and author of The Tailored Brain: From Ketamine, to Keto, to Companionship, A User\u2019s Guide to Feeling Better and Thinking Smarter (\u201cfantastic and timely,\u201d Salon) and of Phallacy: Life Lessons from the Animal Penis (which Pulitzer winner Ed Yong calls \u201ca hilarious tour through a menagerie of dicks, and a ferocious guide to not being a dick yourself\u201d).

So instead of observing that \u201cday,\u201d I\u2019d like to make you aware of a couple of men whose legacies are decades of damage to autistic people. [A content note: this essay contains references to abuse, anti-autistic bigotry, Nazi prison camps, and suicide.]\nOne is the man who founded the most unempathetic empire in behavioral therapy: applied behavioral analysis, typically the sole \u201ctreatment\u201d that insurance covers for autistic children. This man, Ivar Lovaas, makes a perfect pairing with Bruno Bettelheim, the person responsible for famously misapprehending autistic people and especially their mothers, whom he compared with Nazis and popularized as chilly \u201crefrigerator mothers.\u201d\nThese two men, born a generation apart, still had something in common that may have driven their distance from humanity and inability to humanize the people they thought they were helping. That something? Also Nazis.\nLovaas seems to have viewed all human relationships, including the parent\u2013child relationship, as transactional: a sip of juice for a kiss, maybe a nip of ice cream for a hug. In his mind, autistic people\u2019s behaviors were unacceptable and needed to be conditioned out of them in the same way he\u2019d learned rats could be trained and conditioned.\nYet with the rats, only one party was human. In Lovaas\u2019s \u201ctreatment\u201d regime, both parties were human, but only one of the two in that exchange \u2014 not the autistic child \u2014 was seen as fully human. As Lovaas described the autistic people he and his legions of followers were ostensibly helping:\n\u201cYou see, you start pretty much from scratch when you work with an autistic child. You have a person in the physical sense \u2014 they have hair, a nose and a mouth \u2014 but they are not people in the psychological sense. One way to look at the job of helping autistic kids is to see it as a matter of constructing a person. You have the raw materials, but you have to build the person.\u201d\nAs I ask in my book, The Tailored Brain:\n\u201cIs that the mark of a sociopath to not view other humans as fully human and all human interactions as quid pro quo? It is at least the full embodiment of a dysempath.\u201d\nLovaas dehumanized autistic children, talking about them as not persons but as being costumed as a person, with \u201chair, a nose and mouth.\u201d He literally wrote that \u201cthey are not people.\u201d He advocated treating them in the same way some researchers treat lab rats, including initially with electric shocks.\nThe back and forth around autism and who does and does not have appropriate human instincts about others\u2019 humanity isn\u2019t confined to this single man. In the early years of efforts to clarify the lineaments of autism, psychologist Bruno Bettelheim decided that ice cold mothers cause the condition by forcing their children to retreat into themselves. Being autistic, you see, was the result of having a \u201crefrigerator mother,\u201d a concept popularized by Bettelheim (though coined by Leo Kanner, another researcher who left a legacy of trauma).\nTo be clear: Autistic people are born, not made.\nOn the spectrum of how we see each other, Bettelheim and Lovaas were at the end where we see others as animals but not fully human ones. On the other end of that spectrum, we see each other as humans \u2014 we humanize one another.\nSeeing each other\u2019s humanity can be a heavy lift in cognitive terms. It takes work \u2014 real brain power and resources \u2014 to pause and engage in perspective-taking, especially someone whom we don\u2019t immediately understand or \u201cvibe\u201d with. When we\u2019re stressed and overloaded, we don\u2019t have the resources to devote to this work, and we tend to take shortcuts \u2014 usually down the road to anger, attack, and dismissiveness. That\u2019s probably a familiar experience in These Times.\nTrauma also can lead us into these reactions. It\u2019s sometimes just easier to objectify people and not feel for them or with them because feeling someone else\u2019s pain is labor and, well, it hurts. Some of us will go to great lengths to avoid experiencing that kind of pain, even if it means hurting others in the process.\nWhat made Lovaas do what he did? He may well have thought that his sadistic, damaging approach (similar to his attempts at \u201cconversion therapy\u201d) was somehow in the best interests of autistic children or children with intellectual disability. But his starting point, quite explicitly, was a lack of empathy for autistic people as full human beings and his embrace of authoritarianism. Bettelheim similarly viewed autistic people as \u201cempty fortresses.\u201d His approach to what he presumably considered as filling those fortresses was damaging and brutal.\nThe understructure that allows humans to sense and appreciate the full humanity of people who aren\u2019t like them seems to have been absent in Lovaas and Bettelheim. The damage that their ideas and approaches have done to autistic people is immeasurable, something of which you should be aware, on April 2 and the other 364 or 365 days of the year.\nLovaas was born in Norway in 1927, and Bettelheim was born in Austria in 1901. Despite the difference in their ages and different approaches to \u201ctreating\u201d autistic people (Bettelheim leaned Freudian and psychoanalytical, whereas Lovaas leaned toward trying to train autistic people as though they were rats), they had one thing in common. They themselves were subjected to one of the most fascist, authoritarian regimes in modern western history: the Nazis. Lovaas was a forced farm worker in Norway during the Nazi occupation, putting in 10 or more hours a day in the fields. Bettelheim, from a Jewish family in Austria, was imprisoned in both Dachau and Buchenwald in the 1930s.\nBoth men referenced these experiences as motivating their pursuits in the field of psychology. Bettelheim even published research about prisoner behavior in the Nazi camps, and in an ironic twist, described the complex and rigid regimes of these camps as directly designed to \u201cbreak the prisoners\u2019 will\u201d to resist the Nazi\u2019s demands. In the process, Bettelheim concluded, the prisoners came to view themselves differently and in identification with their tormentors, becoming helpless and dependent on them.\nIn his book, Man\u2019s Search for Meaning, neurologist and psychiatrist Victor Frankl wrote about his agonizing and eventually numbing experience at Auschwitz. He wrote that with each new indignity, with each aspect of self that the Nazis stripped away, the defense mechanism that he and others adopted was \u201ccold curiosity\u201d coupled with a \u201cstrange kind of humor.\u201d The curiosity, Frankl wrote, \u201csomehow detaching the mind from its surroundings, which came to be regarded with a kind of objectivity. At that time, one cultivated this state of mind as a means of protection.\u201d It was a necessary and protective distance.\nThe other thing prisoners had to do, Frankl wrote, was to try to deaden emotions, including a \u201cboundless longing for his home and his family\u201d and \u201cdisgust with all the ugliness which surrounded him.\u201d Ultimately, this deadening translated into apathy, so much so that Frankl described himself as feeling surprised at his ability to unemotionally sip soup at a window through which he could see the corpse of a man who had died of typhus hours before, right in front of him. This \u201cblunting of emotions,\u201d Frankl wrote, created a \u201cprotective shell\u201d against the psychological and physical assaults the Nazis inflicted at every turn.\nLife in that camp, said Frankl, \u201ctore open the human soul and exposed its depths.\u201d Although people on the outside might believe that prisoners and camp guards could easily be divided into decent and indecent people, Frankl demurred. \u201cThe mere knowledge that a man was either a camp guard or a prisoner tells us almost nothing. Human kindness can be found in all groups, even those which as whole it would be easy to condemn.\u201d\nThe people in the camp, he asserted, could not be easily divided into angels (prisoners) and devils (camp guards). Frankl also noted that the thresholds differed. A guard could be viewed as beneficent just by showing \u201ceven the smallest kindness,\u201d whereas a prisoner who treated his fellow prisoners badly was \u201cexceptionally contemptible.\u201d\nAs Frankl also wrote, \u201can abnormal reaction to an abnormal situation is normal behavior.\u201d Numbing oneself is not \u201cnormal\u201d unless it protects against the abnormal infliction of constant torture. So perhaps it\u2019s not surprising that the reactions of the prisoners upon their release were not \u201cnormal,\u201d either. There was no jubilation, Frankl recalled. They had \u201cliterally lost the ability to feel pleased and had to relearn it slowly.\u201d Frankl\u2019s first wife, father, mother, and brother all died in the Nazi camps.\nFrankl went on to found a field of therapy called \u201clogotherapy,\u201d which focuses on healing through meaning, through finding purpose in life related to love, work, or courage. He wrote in Man\u2019s Search for Ultimate Meaning, originally published in 1943 as a follow-up to his first book, that psychotherapy was in \u201cdire need of a rehumanization\u201d and he urged that the \u201chuman dimension\u201d not be left out of therapeutic approaches.\nPerhaps in their ways, all three of these men emerged from their experiences with a brutal, fascist, murderous regime with that sense of purpose that Frankl emphasizes in his writing and his proposed system of logotherapy. Frankl calls again and again for humanizing others and notes his own journey to relearning the ability to feel pleasure. In contrast, the infliction by both Lovaas and Bettelheim of a cold, distant, and dehumanizing approach to treating autistic children suggests that perhaps their transition never quite completed. They remained dysempathic.\nIn their framing, autistic people couldn\u2019t win. Either their mothers loved them too much and harmed them (Lovaas) or didn\u2019t love them enough and made them autistic (Bettelheim). The program Lovaas built relies on authoritarianism: It is highly regimented and complex and explicitly intended to break the \u201cwill\u201d of autistic people to resist complying with what is being demanded of them, no matter how irrational it seems.\nFor decades, Bettelheim was the head of the Orthogenic School, a \u201ctreatment\u201d facility where children who\u2019d undergone \u201cparentectomies\u201d \u2014 removal of their frigid, autism-causing parents \u2014 resided, sometimes for more than 10 years. Former residents at this institution held resentment and trauma for years afterward, with one describing \u201cabject animal terror\u201d when Bettelheim walked the dorm hallways because of his reputation for physically and emotionally abusing the children. A faculty colleague told a reporter that \u201cin the Orthogenic School, Bettelheim\u2019s mind supplanted your own.\u201d\nBoth Bettelheim and Lovaas quickly became quite powerful in their fields. Bettelheim rose to prominence within just a few years of his arrival in the United States in 1939 following his release from Buchenwald (some of his rise was predicated on some sleights of hand about his educational credentials and filigree of his biography). Lovaas took the lead in the field of applied behavioral analysis within a decade of arriving in the United States on a college scholarship for playing the violin.\nThese new heights of power probably were not salutary for healing a broken empathy. Indeed, after Bettelheim\u2019s death by suicide in 1990, a colleague at the Orthogenic School told a journalist that Bettelheim \u201cgot worse once he started getting acclaim.\u201d\nYou\u2019ve seen how Lovaas viewed his autistic \u201cpatients,\u201d as something incompletely human, with the \u201craw materials\u201d there for building whatever it was he viewed as \u201ctruly human.\u201d Bettelheim\u2019s view largely echoed that of Lovaas. In his 1967 book, The Empty Fortress: Infantile Autism and the Birth of the Self, Bettelheim wrote about autistic children \u201cprogressing\u201d through his program: \u201cWhen at least the once totally frozen affects begin to emerge,\u201d the observer will see \u201ca much richer human personality to evolve \u2026.\u201d\nThe \u201cfortress\u201d here is the child, and the child is empty because his mother was ice cold, or to use the comparison Bettelheim actually made, like a Nazi prison camp guard whose behavior forced the child to retreat and act as an empty fortress by way of coping. Yet in his own institution, Bettelheim is described as thinking that \u201cslapping the children [would] wake them to reality \u2026 but they seemed to have experienced it as if he was trying to make them automatons,\u201d empty fortresses of his own making.\nBettelheim had shared, in some way, Frankl\u2019s experience and observation of needing to feel nothing to survive under unimaginable conditions. But Bettelheim took that experience and misapplied his \u201cempathy,\u201d believing that the withdrawn nature he perceived in autistic children must be the same in cause and effect. Who was closest to blame as stand-ins for the Nazis if not the mothers? He makes this explicit in Fortress:\nSome victims of the concentration camps had lost their humanity in response to extreme situations. Autistic children withdraw from the world before their humanity ever really develops. Could there be any connection, I wondered, between the impact of the two kinds of inhumanity I had known \u2014 one inflicted for political reasons on victims of a social system, the other perhaps a self-chosen state of dehumanization [italics mine] \u2026 For myself it was the German concentration camps that let me to introspect in the most personal, immediate ways on what kinds of experience can dehumanize. I had experienced being at the mercy of forces that seemed beyond one\u2019s ability to influence, and with no knowledge of whether or when the experience would end\u2026.\nBoth Bettelheim and Lovaas left a legacy of violence toward and abuse of the people whom they claimed to treat, an impression of a bullying and belligerent nature that became increasingly emergent as their power accrued. It\u2019s reasonable to infer that factors shaping an authoritarian, self-aggrandizing, self-satisfied nature \u2014 because who is an angel and who is a devil is not always clear by their role \u2014 led them to the processes they chose to as \u201ctreatment\u201d for autistic children.\nThey (and their defenders) would say that their actions were born of empathy, of some sense of what was happening with autistic children and why, and a method to \u201cfix\u201d it or \u201crecover\u201d them from their \u201cshell\u201d or \u201cempty fortress.\u201d Autistic people who have experienced the programs Lovaas and Bettelheim fathered say otherwise.\nBoth men seem to have grafted their experiences with the Nazis in different ways. Lovaas translated that regimented, forced grind in the fields into a construct that, when melded with ideas from conditioning rat behavior, forced similar compliance from autistic children. Bettelheim saw in autistic children\u2019s apparent lack of emotional response (a misconstruction on his part) the apathy and numbness that operated as crucial survival skills in Nazi camps.\nSo here we have men with experiences that may have led to empathic dysfunction as part of a defense mechanism, men who took the very kinds of pain that caused their trauma and inflicted them on other people, men who projected (Bettelheim blaming refrigerator mothers, both of them dehumanizing autistic people), and men who came to hold immense power in their respective arenas. Within those arenas, they were the lions to whom the world delivered autistic children to be traumatized.\nIn a saccharine movie, the experiences Lovaas and Bettelheim had with Nazis would form an emotional narrative, shaping them into deeply empathic, sympathetic people whose own pain gave them an exquisite understanding of the pain of others. In our harsh reality, their pasts left them inside their own fortresses, impenetrable to humanizing feelings, coming in or going out.\n\u2014\nFor further reading into the history of autism and psychotherapy, I recommend Steve Silberman\u2019s Neurotribes.\nI am a science journalist and author of The Tailored Brain: From Ketamine, to Keto, to Companionship, A User\u2019s Guide to Feeling Better and Thinking Smarter (\u201cfantastic and timely,\u201d Salon) and of Phallacy: Life Lessons from the Animal Penis (which Pulitzer winner Ed Yong calls \u201ca hilarious tour through a menagerie of dicks, and a ferocious guide to not being a dick yourself\u201d).

Are masks merely symbols, band-aid solutions for politicians, security blankets for a worried population \u2014 or necessary PPE?\nHere in Denmark, the COVID19 lockdown is easing up and life is returning to the streets. By all accounts, the country tackled the crisis with a strong, early response. Schools, most shops and cafes/bars/restaurants closed but we could move freely about our cities \u2014 as long as no more than ten people were gathered together.\n\n\nHere\u2019s the curve in Denmark \u2014 the blue is where we\u2019re at and the other curves are where we feared we were heading. On the right, unemployment is up, but only about 2% on average and up to 3% in harder hit regions.\nIn the past four weeks, I\u2019ve counted exactly 34 face masks.\nI kept track while walking or cycling through the city, as well as observing the busy intersection, including many buses, outside my windows at home, where I\u2019ve been working. More than half of the observed mask wearers appeared to be non-Danes. My observations are similar to those made by friends and colleagues in other Nordic countries. Physical distancing has been the main approach instead. The same lack of masks is seen in the Nordic and Baltic countries \u2014 a region of 30 million people \u2014 and yet we pretty effective at beating the virus.\nThe narrative about wearing masks never came to Denmark during the COVID19 crisis. The authorities have said that the scientific jury is out, so they never pushed them \u2014 except for medical professionals, of course. Duh. I find it interesting, however, how the narrative gained purchase in so many other places, even though the scientific community is still debating the topic.\nEven the European Centre for Disease Control is vague about the use of what are called \u201ccommunity masks\u201d:\nIt is not known how much the use of masks in the community can contribute to a decrease in transmission in addition to the other countermeasures.\nThe use of face masks in the community should be considered only as a complementary measure and not as a replacement for established preventive measures, for example physical distancing, respiratory etiquette, meticulous hand hygiene and avoiding touching the face, nose, eyes and mouth.\nIn the past couple of weeks, the mask narrative has really been ramped up. To the point where you feel that people think they can repel meteor strikes. They are now obligatory in many places or required on public transport in a number of countries. In the early stages of the crisis, you\u2019ll recall the whole communication effort about coughing or sneezing into your sleeve and then there was the whole \u201cdon\u2019t touch your face\u201d rhetoric. That one disappeared pretty quick. From a behavioural perspective, I guess it\u2019s hard to change a million years of hominin habit.\nBut hey. What\u2019s up with the recent acceleration of this whole mask wearing thing? I think it\u2019s quite simple. This is a crisis of mammoth proportions and the national reactions to it have varied, as have the levels of lockdown and quarantine. Governments made hard decisions and citizens complied with the restrictions. By and large, the citizenry was \u2014 and is \u2014 acutely aware of the gravity of the situation.\nAuthorities seem to be adopting a two-pronged approach. Firstly, they\u2019re passing mask-wearing laws to ensure that they are covering their backs in case the virus starts escalating again. Passing the buck of responsibility, in a way, and sharing that responsibility with the population. It\u2019s that whole political \u201cwe can\u2019t be too careful!\u201d approach that I wrote about in this article about COVID and the Culture of Fear.\nInvoking the Danish word \u201csymbolpolitik\u201d is relevant here. Symbolic policy seems to be the primary driver behind the new mask-wearing laws that are emerging.\nSecondly, in this time of uncertainty, masks seem to be the actual symbol that people somehow need. A visible uniform to show you\u2019re on the same page as the authorities and societal team. A mini security blanket to allay fears \u2014 both yours and others.\nYesterday, for example, The International Air Transport Association (IATA) \u2014 the trade association for the world\u2019s airlines \u2014 announced that they\u2019ll recommend face masks on flights now \u2014 and into the future. It\u2019s a corporate move, nothing more. Designed to make people comfortable about flying again and to avoid having to fly with empty middle seats.\nOnce you have a symbol and a uniform, it\u2019s open season on shaming. On my SoMe channels, I\u2019m reading about examples of this in other countries. The similarities to bicycle helmets. The 10% of the world\u2019s cyclists who wear helmets \u2014 the majority being members of a sub-culture with prerequisite uniforms and gear \u2014 are disproportionately noisy in their shaming narrative. Luckily, it\u2019s mostly a North American/Australasian thing \u2014 judging and shaming strangers is unique to those regions and \u2014 luckily \u2014 considered unacceptable social behaviour in most of the rest of the world. But shaming is loud and rude \u2014 despite the scientific jury remaining undecided on the topic.\nThere has been fingerpointing and dirty looks throughout the crisis so far. A generation of Facebook experts are intent on schooling your sorry ass, even with a stern look.\nI have no opinion on your personal choice to wear one. Do it or don\u2019t. But now that the symbol of the crisis has finally emerged \u2014 a wearable uniform visible from a distance \u2014 we\u2019ll see a sharp rise in the cases of sanctimonious shaming in the face mask department in the near future.\nJust probably not in the Nordic countries.", "comment_count": 2, "like_count": 56, "created_time": 1588754693545, "comment": [{"user_id": "6867b839d77e", "comment_time": 1588754693545, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "91d9edacfa4", "comment_time": 1595554734933, "comment": "Comparing bicycle-helmets to face-masks?

Nevertheless, I am sure to highlight that I am not a cyclist or a member of any cycling sub-culture \u2014 I\u2019m just a person who uses a bike to get around.\nWith THAT said, I will admit that the pure, raw poetry of what is surely one of humankind\u2019s most splendid inventions is something that means a great deal to me. I just don\u2019t bang on about it as much as you might imagine.\nIf The Bicycle had a curriculum vit\u00e6 and showed up at a job interview, it would be quite the event.\n\u201cYeah, so I contributed pretty much single-handedly in the emancipation of women starting back in the late 1800s \u2014 essentially for the first time since the Agricultural Revolution. I expanded the mobility radius of the working class around that time, too. Enabling them to travel farther for work and basically propping up economies around the world. It\u2019s wild to think, but I improved the human gene pool, LOL, by enabling men and women to travel farther in search of partners. The American Highway System? You\u2019re welcome \u2014 although you humans messed THAT up later. Improving public health? Yeah, I\u2019ve had THAT covered for almost a century and a half. Oh, and hey\u2026 I\u2019m right there ready to go in any disaster or war zone\u2026\u201d\nAll delivered in a matter-of-fact, nonchalant tone punctuated with lots of humble shrugs and nervous laughs. As I wrote in my book Copenhagenize, there has been no invention in human history that has transformed human society so quickly, effectively and positively.\nThe bicycle just is. It has no regard for race or gender. It has always simply performed its timeless task of providing us with a valuable tool to make our daily lives easier. We take it for granted and that\u2019s okay. But when crisis or disaster strikes, this is when the bicycle becomes an incredibly valuable tool and symbol.\nLike most other humans I have been following the tragedy that is the brutal Russian war against Ukraine very closely. Shocked, angry, saddened. In the early days of the invasion, photos emerged of citizens on bikes in the besieged capital.\n\n\n\nAbove, a Ukrainian is carrying all manner of weaponry on a bike (left). A cyclist goes for a training ride on empty streets surrounded by soldiers and armoured vehicles (centre).\nInevitably in the bike silo on social media, photos did the rounds of Mayor Klitschko of Kyiv (right) and President Volodymyr Zelensky on bikes. The bicycle humanises people in the dark heart of a conflict and we crave to see such imagery. Before the war, Klitschko was often seen on a bicycle riding to work or to meetings in the capital. Indeed, he has recently called for private companies to resume bike rentals to allow citizens to move around the city during the war.\nWhenever a celebrity dies, if there is a photo of them on a bike you can be sure it\u2019ll show up in the SoMe feeds that offer a tribute to them.\n\nBicycles in the Ukrainian war zone\nWe are now well into the war in Ukraine and the media coverage often features photos of citizens on bikes in the ruins of their cities bombed by Russia. I\u2019ll get into why this is a poignant, recurring theme.\nThe Bicycle\u2019s Role in War and Disaster Zones\nThrough the years I have have collected photos showing how the bicycle fulfils a vital role during wartime and disasters.\nNagasaki, Japan. 1945\nThis is a man carrying goods on a bicycle after the Americans bombed Nagasaki with an atomic bomb in 1945. The bicycle in its inherent role as an integral tool. A functional workhorse and practical transport form. In the case of this man, it assists him in transporting what we can only guess are incredibly important goods that will hopefully ensure his survival. A photographer chose to shoot this photo and publications chose to print it.\nWe can see photos of people fleeing conflict or disaster on foot, carrying what they can. We can identify with that. What would I bring with me if that was me?\nAdd a bicycle, however, and it seems to change. The human subject somehow becomes more resilient. They have acquired a vehicle that will help them carry more and travel farther away from the horrors. People with bikes humanise the situation for the viewer.\n\n\nI have a habit of trying to analyse what photos get the best legs during times of crisis by showing up on multiple platforms after capturing the imagination of a wide variety of photo editors.\nPhotos from the early days of the invasion in Ukraine showed people trying to navigate bombed bridges as they were fleeing. Some of the most replicated photos on media sites showed people carrying bicycles. It was also the photos of soldiers helping a mother carry a baby carriage across the rubble that were shown around the world. The same applies to that baby carriage as to the bicycle.\nIt\u2019s the same thought process as classic (perhaps clich\u00e9d) photos of a child\u2019s teddy bear or doll in a bombed out setting \u2014 but while the teddy bear speaks silent volumes as a still photo, the baby carriage and the bicycle show human determination, movement and a quest for freedom.\n\n\nCitizens with bicycles in the aftermath of the Japan tsunami in 2011\nIn the aftermath of the tsunami that devastated parts of Japan in 2011, the world was offered photos from the ravaged streets of the cities that were affected. Again, I noticed how many photos featured people with bicycles. Japan is the third most cycling nation in the world, so bikes are ubiquitous in the Japanese urban context, but still they were a primary focus of news photographers \u2014 even those from countries where bicycles are no longer mainstream.\nIn the photo above (right), we can be amazed at the force of a tsunami that tosses around cars like matchsticks, while in the background people are using bikes to get around after the fact.\n\nPost-tsunami photos from Japan\nIn these photos, the human scale of a person on a bicycle is used as a stark contrast to the huge ship lying on its side (left) and a bicycle jutting out of the mud is chosen as a motif for a quiet, visual moment of reflection of human fragility and the power of disaster\u2014 like the teddy bear (right).\nOn the day of the tsunami, public transport ground to a halt in many cities, including Tokyo. The 20 million daily rail and metro passengers (20% of whom rode a bike to their station of origin that morning) had to scramble to get home and bikes were sold out in the megacity in hours. You simply couldn\u2019t get a bike. I heard about this from friends in the city that I was texting to make sure they were alright, but a number of news outlets reported on this as well.\nI am well aware that I have a tendency to geek out about such under-the-radar observations about the bicycle\u2019s role as a tool and the symbolism it projects. There is no rule of thumb for photographers to include a bike when covering wars and disasters. It is merely a relatable, human subject.\nIn a seemingly endless hour of sorrow and destruction, the bicycle offers hope. In an unfathomably ravaged terrain with the air filled with not only the stench of destruction and death but also the thick, heavy sensation of despair, humans with bikes portray survival, whether they use them to search for loved ones, to gather the remnants of their belongings, to get home to their family in lieu of public transport or cars.\nThe photos show how timeless the bicycle\u2019s role is in society and how it assists citizens in their darkest hour. An hour that most of us can never imagine.\nThe bicycle symbolises freedom and resilience.\n\n\nThe aftermath of the 2011 earthquake in Concepcion, Chile. At center, a man salvages a valuable bicycle from the ruins\nI\u2019ve documented the same photographic focus on bikes in many disasters through the years. After a savage 8.8 earthquake struck the city of Concepcion, Chile in 2010, bikes appeared in the news cycles. Above, a man salvages a bicycle from the ruins (centre). Choosing to save a valuable item for later use. Citizens roll around the city to see the destruction or check up on their homes (left and right).\nBicycles are often the best way to get around when a city has been destroyed.\n\nAftermath of earthquakes in Concepcion, Chile in 2010 and 1960\nAbove, we are offered the opportunity to share the awe of the citizen on his bike as he regards the brutal result of the powerful earthquake (left). And history repeats itself. Above, at right, is a man trying to get his bicycle across a shattered bridge in the same city after an earthquake in 1960 (right).\n\nPost-tsunami salvaging in Indonesia in 2004\nAs another example, many of the photos after the tsunami that devastated Indonesia in 2004 featured the unspoken theme of showing bikes. A man salvaging a bike from the rubble (left) and a mangled bike atop a pile of debris (right).\n\n\nPost-tsunami photos from Indonesia in 2004\nPeople on a bike photographed to show the contrasting scale of the destruction (left), resilient citizens on bikes and trishaws starting to piece their life together (center) and people regarding the destruction by bike (right).\n\nThe bicycle\u2019s role is integral not only in areas stricken by natural catastrophe or war. In the above photo, North Koreans are packing a load of used bicycles at the port in Maizuru, Japan on October 13, 2006 after the Japanese government adopted trade sanctions against North Korea. A response to the the country declaring it had done nuclear testing of a device on October 9, 2006.\nThe bicycles went off to North Korea to serve their indispensable role \u2014 even in a dictatorship . Clearly regarded as important goods to transport back in light of the sanctions.\nBicycles as a Symbol of Death and Destruction (Graphic Photos)\n\n\nWhile the primary intention of showing bicycles in war and disaster zones appears to be to offer scale and hope, there is also a contrasting theme. The bicycle plays a poignant role in the storytelling of these photographs, as well, and it\u2019s not always positive. A German bicycle battalion in the Great War going off to kill (left). The iconic photo of the charred remains of a boy and his bicycle in Dresden, Germany after the Allied bombing (right).\n\n\n\nThe photo above (left) has been widely distributed in the past week after Ukrainian forces re-entered the city of Bucha and discovered the widespread massacre of civilians by Russian soldiers. There are many photos of citizens executed in the street but one of the most shocking was the man who was gunned down as he was riding his bicycle and it was widely distributed.\nI have seen a number of such photos from war zones through history, like the boy in Dresden, but also from more recent history, in Sarajevo in the 1990s. A couple lie next to a bicycle in the street after being executed by a sniper (center) and the famous photograph by Annie Liebowitz of the bicycle and bloodstains of a boy who was also killed by a sniper in the city.\nThe bicycle is freedom and hope and resilience but it is also a stark, ever-human reminder of the horrors of war. They killed him! All he was doing was riding a bike?!\nLet us return, shall we, to the bicycle as a positive symbol?\nShould We Include Bicycles in Disaster Preparation?\nThis park transforms into a disaster relief facility in Tokyo\nWhen I was filming the Tokyo episode of my urbanism tv series The Life-Sized City, one segment was about a park that has a dual-purpose. It\u2019s a lovely community park that transforms into a disaster relief area for the locals, who have been instructed to gather here when the earthquake strikes. As ever, Japanese preparedness and design thinking is an inspiration.\nThere is a warehouse next to the park with all the necessities for surviving the the aftermath of the earthquake and this is pretty standard around Japan. But what about providing bikes as well? A small fleet of bikes with utilitarian baskets and maybe trailers for post-disaster use? A municipal bike hub?\nAlthough maybe it isn\u2019t necessary since historically, bicycles have had a habit of appearing when they\u2019re needed most, salvaged by citizens who instinctively know their worth.\nIn Portland, Oregon, USA, they are way ahead of the curve regarding using bicycles in disaster mitigation. For more than a decade they have performed Disaster Relief Drills featuring cargo bikes. If an earthquake or tsunami strikes, citizens are preparing themselves for how to tackle the humanitarian needs afterwards and bikes are the key. This should be standard disaster preparation policy around the world.\nNo bikes in Copenhagen after The Rain? Lol.\nWhile Portland gets it and citizens in war-torn cities or disaster zones intuitively figure it out in a hurry, the entertainment industry often lacks the same imagination. When the Danish Netflix series The Rain premiered in 2018, a post-apocalyptic Copenhagen was shown. When you live here, it was wild to see your city reimagined as a disaster area.\nIt was, however, comical to see the few survivors wandering around on foot. C\u2019mon, man. This is a city with more bikes than humans AND with over 50,000 cargo bikes. Survivors wouldn\u2019t be walking or pushing shopping carts. The main group of characters wouldn\u2019t schlep to Sweden. EVERYBODY would be on bikes in order to carry valuable stuff or to escape quickly from external threats.\n\n\nIt\u2019s hilarious to think that the Danish writers and producers didn\u2019t even consider this reality considering they live here. Other disaster films often feature bikes, though. Not on the scale that would be realistic based on what we see in ACTUAL disaster zones, but still. Above, King Christian X of Denmark liked to irritate the German occupiers during World War Tour by taking a ride around Copenhagen. He was guarded voluntarily by a fleet of cargo bikes ridden by the city\u2019s bike messengers (left). The over 50,000 cargo bikes in Copenhagen would be just as indispensable in the event of disaster as they are today (right).\n\nAfter the bombs in Ukraine. After the tsunami in Japan.\nNews photographers with their human eye sub-consciously focus on bicycles in ravaged areas, photo editors select these photos for distribution and we the viewers see them and use them to sense the situation.\nDespite the unspeakable horrors of war and the destructive nature of disasters, I find solace and poetry in the way the bicycle remains a valuable tool and a symbol of hope, resilience and freedom, as well as representing the human-scale of tragedy.\n\n\n\nLong live the bicycle and whatever small roles it can play when we need it the most.\n\nVintage Ukraina/\u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0430 bicycles\nOn a vaguely related note, when I was living in Moscow in the early 1990s, I rode around on a vintage Ukraina/\u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0430 bicycle and I\u2019ve loved them ever since. They were the most popular brand in the Soviet Union and were exported to over 30 countries. The Leitner bicycle factory was moved to Kharkiv from Riga during World War 1 and it was nationalised after the October Revolution. Over 30 million were made.

Back to a modus operandi that predated the automobile \u2014 and that attempts to fix the planning mistakes made because of it.\nThings are very different here in Copenhagen and in Denmark, however, where they are planning megaprojects like it\u2019s the 1950s. As I\u2019ve highlighted before, they\u2019re also just copy-pasting plans from the 1950s and 1960s instead of adapting urban development to the new century.\nWatch this video about the environmental nightmare \u2014 Lynetteholm\nThe biggest monster in the city at the moment is the proposed artificial island at the head of the harbour called Lynetteholm. An environmental catastrophe unfolding before our eyes, propelled by developers and their political lapdogs.\nThis article is a history lesson as much as it is a cautionary tale about the current political desire for more motorways and vanity megaprojects.\nMegaprojects generally cause two reactions among the general population. Firstly there is often a strong fascination bias when they are proposed. It\u2019s so big and shiny and impressive that it has to be a good thing. Secondly, after a megaproject is approved, in comes a sense of surrenderism where people become resigned to the fact that the fight is over.\nThis article is about a series of massive megaprojects that were planned for Copenhagen, approved by politicians and then\u2026 disappeared. Which gives hope that we can defeat the current projects.\nAwkward History\nUrban development mega-projects are usually something that we associate with the years after the Second World War when the car started its advance on our cities and we desperately tried to make space for it. In my research, however, I discovered that there are examples that go farther back.\nDrawing of the 1910 tunnel proposal in the iconic Nyhavn district of Copenhagen\nIn 1910, there was a serious proposal to build a tunnel under the harbour from the city centre to the southern shore \u2014 probably the Christianshavn neighbourhood. The proposed location was Nyhavn, the now iconic canal with the coloured houses and old sailing ships that provides Copenhagen with its most Instagrammable backdrop. Nyhavn was always the most colourful part of the city in many ways. Sailors went ashore here for centuries, in search of alcohol, tattoos and sex workers so it has always been a neighbourhood that politicians wanted to \u201cfix\u201d, even well into the 1950s and 1960s.\nIn the post-war years, as we know, cities around the world were seduced by American traffic engineering and the idea that the car was the only future we would ever need. The bombed cities in Germany offered clean slates for drastic urban renewal. Indeed, the transformation of Hannover was called The Miracle of Hannover when the wide, car-centric streets were completed.\nSimilar plans for massive highways in other cities. Only Stockholm went through with it.\nEven cities that were spared the bombs started planning similar urban renewal projects. I\u2019ve seen the wild plans for Amsterdam, Oslo, Helsinki, Glasgow, Paris and even Vancouver, to mention just a few cities that were intent on future-proofing themselves. Stockholm was the only Nordic city that actually went ahead with the American Dream. The urban planning joke in the Nordics is that they bombed themselves before and after the war \u2014 and they\u2019re still dealing with the issues it caused.\n\nThe Big H plan for motorways to connect Denmark in the 1950s\nCopenhagen was no exception. In the 1950s, a national strategy called The Big H was launched, aimed at connecting Denmark with motorways, inspired, like the US and other countries, by the Autobahn network associated with Hitler. What a role model. The right side of the H would run from the ferry from Sweden (this was long before the \u00d8resund Bridge was built to Sweden), down through Copenhagen and onward to the ferries to Germany. The first motorways that were built were the ones that led to the capital, starting in 1956 and never really stopping since.\nS\u00f8ringen \u2014 The Lake Ring (1958\u20131973)\n\nIn 1958, massive megaprojects in Copenhagen were proposed. The Lake Ring \u2014 S\u00f8ringen in Danish \u2014 was the first, and the one that would dominate the narrative for years to come. It would sweep into the city from the north, turn right at The Lakes and continue on to the south of the city. Over the next fifteen years, space for the coming motorway was found and buildings were bulldozed.\nThe areas and roads that are leftovers from the 1950s planning projects in Copenhagen\nThe most extreme examples are still visible today. Buildings along Lyngbyvej to the north were knocked down, the road leading to the city centre along the harbour was widened, as was the Langebro bridge over the harbour.\nThe green strip is where the motorway would be placed\nCloser to the city, a green strip along Tagensvej and Fredensgade was where the Lake Ring would be placed. Amorparken at the top and what is now Fredenspark at the bottom.\nThe old National Hospital with Amorparken \u2014 and where the motorway would be placed\nAmorparken dates from 1910, when it formed splendidly landscaped gardens outside the main entrance of the national hospital. Most of the beautiful hospital buildings were bulldozed and, in 1970, the new Rigshospitalet opened. Across the street, construction of the Panum Institute (built 1971\u20131986) started later, but the idea was the same. These two brutalist monsters would be located on either side of the monster motorway.\n\nLeft: the buildings razed to make space for more cars. Right: Fredensgade street before that happened\nFarther down from Amorparken, the road bottlenecked through a densely-populated neighbourhood around Fredensgade. In 1972, a large swath of buildings were removed, despite protests. The strip of green is, today, a welcome buffer between the buildings that remain and the busy road, but these are not parks that citizens write home about. They often feel like non-places due to their awkward location in the dusty, leftover motorway plans.\nThe route the motorway would have taken along the southern shore of The Lakes\nThe Lake Ring would roar down to The Lakes and turn right, running along the southern shore. In places, 30 metres of water would be reallocated to cars and flyovers would reach the height of the second floor of the buildings.\nAt the end of The Lakes, the initial 1958 plans featured a tunnel that would emerge in the area around Halmtorvet, to the west of the city centre. I have learned that the tunnel was later dropped when the plans evolved and grew in scale. Instead, the motorway would just plough through.\nCity Plan Vest (1958\u20131973)\nCity Plan Vest (West) plans from 1958\nThis is where the Lake Ring would now merge with its evil twin \u2014 City Plan Vest (West). In 1958, the tunnel would have preserved many traditional buildings and most of the motorway infrastructure would have been placed on the location of the Meatpacking District (K\u00f8dbyen).\nOver the next decade, that changed drastically. The entire area was earmarked for destruction, with huge new commercial buildings rising up on the spot instead, with the motorway roaring through and then branching out to the south and west.\nWhat City Plan Vest would have looked like \u2014 superimposed on Copenhagen\u2019s Vesterbro district\nThis would have seen the total and utter destruction of an entire neighbourhood, with thousands and thousands of people displaced and hundreds of buildings knocked down. Below, you can see the huge scale of the City Plan Vest project and where the places we know today are located.\n\nIf you have ever been on Halmtorvet Square in the Vesterbro neighbourhood, you might have wondered what one odd-looking building is doing there, looking totally out of context with the traditional architecture around it. This is now a police precinct called Station City. Like the National Hospital and Panum Institute, it was built in anticipation of the coming motorway and urban development.\nModel for the new City Plan Vest development 1960s\nThe Lake Ring and City Plan Vest were considered to be a sure thing \u2014 so much so that buildings were erected in advance of them. Now they all look so sad, awkward and out of place.\nCar-free City Centre?\nIt is interesting to mention that the mediaeval city centre, in many of the plans of the age, was either going to be car-light or even car-free. Parking garages, in some of the plans, would be placed in the N\u00f8rrebro neighbourhood or even under The Lakes and people were expected to take trams into the centre.\n\n1967 plans for parking garages in the N\u00f8rrebro district, with electric buses ferrying people to the city centre\nOne article even envisioned electric buses replacing the trams back in 1967. Later, in the mid-1970s, the Dutch city of Groningen adopted this model of garages outside the city centre, with marginal success.\nReading all of these old documents from back then is pretty scary. In the Generalplan of 1954, you can see how the bicycle \u2014 that traditional transportational workhorse in Copenhagen \u2014 was regarded.\n\u201cThe plan regards the massive bicycle traffic in the city\u2019s streets as a spatial problem that must be addressed. Cyclists must be encouraged to take the tram instead. Trams take up less space in the city.\u201d\nThat was a different age, indeed.\nUrban Hansen \u2014 Copenhagen\u2019s Robert Moses\nUrban Hansen \u2014 Lord Mayor (1962\u201376) and 1970s anti-Urban grafitti in Vesterbro\nThere were many actors through the decades who were tasked with these huge projects and other smaller ones but in Copenhagen there was really one primary protagonist \u2014 or perhaps antagonist.\nNew York had Robert Moses bulldozing his way through the poor neighbourhoods to make shiny new motorways for the future but in Copenhagen we had the most ironically named mayor in the history of urbanism: Urban Hansen.\nHe was Lord Mayor of Copenhagen from 1962 to 1976. He drank the American Kool-Aid and went to work planning massive motorways, as well as brutal redevelopment projects that cleared out undesirable, low income neighbourhoods.\nUrbanplanen \u2014 social housing district named after Urban Hansen \u2014 they\u2019re still trying to make it work\nHe built social housing developments that later failed miserably, like his namesake Urbanplanen and also Tingbjerg. He was the man who ripped out the Copenhagen tram network after 109 years, replacing them with buses in 1972 \u2014 the year before the first oil crisis. Oh, the irony. Today, Copenhagen is one of the few cities in Europe without trams having built a vanity mini-Metro instead and sending the city into a massive debt.\nUrban Hansen was one of the main proponents of the Lake Ring, City Plan Vest and all the other mega-projects. Calling him the Robert Moses of Copenhagen is not an understatement. I would go as far as to say that he was the most destructive mayor in the history of this city.\nRazing buildings in Vesterbro in the early 1970s\nThe desire for motorways back then was as strong as the desire to raze low-income neighbourhoods to the ground to make space for social housing. The neighbourhoods of Vesterbro and N\u00f8rrebro \u2014 traditional working-class areas \u2014 were constantly under the threat of urban renewal. They were poor areas for decades well into the 1980s and were at the top of the list when the suits in City Hall looked at \u201cimproving\u201d and \u201cmodernising\u201d the city.\nForumlinien \u2014 The Forum Line\n\nThe Forumlinien highway project from 1970\nA new transport minister, Ove Guldberg, launched the idea of Forumlinien (The Forum Line) in 1970. I stumbled across it a few years ago and could only find a couple of visualisations of it. Few people have ever heard of it and it\u2019s hard to find any reference to it at all, even though it hung around for two years.\nA mysterious drawing I found a decade ago \u2014 massive housing complex next to N\u00f8rrebrogade\nI\u2019ve stared at this drawing \u2014 one of the only ones that I could find \u2014 for more than a decade, wondering what the hell it is.\nMotorways above and to the left and a Corbusier-esque street on the right with car traffic below the new buildings along N\u00f8rrebrogade. But right there in the centre is a huge housing project on The Lakes in Copenhagen. It looks like it is six floors high on the left and maybe up to twenty on the right. Surrounded by leafy green areas.\nIt wasn\u2019t hard to figure out the proposed location of this monster so I overlaid it on a current map of this part of N\u00f8rrebro \u2014 Denmark\u2019s most densely-populated neighbourhood then and now.\nWhere the massive round housing project would be placed.\nLook at that. Total destruction, total elimination of an undesirable low income neighbourhood and even reaching over into the City of Frederiksberg on the left. But that\u2019s all I knew about this project, despite hunting for more information.\nThe original documents for Forumlinien plan 1970\nRecently, I succeeded in tracking down the original document. Very few remain, and it has taken me literally years. What I saw in it completely blew my mind.\nIn response to the growing resistance against the Lake Ring, the government and city didn\u2019t propose a softer option \u2014 they went ballistic. The Forum Line route runs through N\u00f8rrebro, Frederiksberg and Vesterbro \u2014 and on to the south of the harbour.\n\n\nWith morbid fascination. I zoomed in on the details and saw how my own neighbourhood and many places I\u2019ve lived in this city would have been completely destroyed.\n\n\nI can\u2019t imagine how many people would have been displaced and how many buildings would have been knocked down. But in the next image, you can see they had already figured that out.\n\nRemember that weird round building I mentioned? I discovered in the document that it was just part of an entire row of them on the north shore of The Lakes. It was just one visualisation of social housing. There are other proposals as well. All dystopian images of a future that was seriously proposed by politicians and the national Road Directorate.\n\n\nMassive housing projects planned along The Lakes in Copenhagen in conjunction with The Forum Line\nA lot of work was put into these proposals, complete with detailed maps of the entire route, with the motorway casually superimposed on densely-populated neighbourhoods.\n\n\nVarious renderings for a total transformation of the area around Bl\u00e5g\u00e5rdsplads in N\u00f8rrebro\nThere seems to be a lot of focus in all of these documents on one particular area of the proposed project near a square called Bl\u00e5g\u00e5rds Plads. It seems to be an epicentre for all of the plans to raze that entire neighbourhood to the ground.\nAfter two years of work, the Forum Line was killed off in 1972. It simply wasn\u2019t a feasible replacement for the Lake Ring. The Transport Minister Ove Guldberg took a last stab at it and started work on an outer motorway ring road called Ydre Ring (Outer Ring). But it didn\u2019t gain much ground. All traffic investments in Copenhagen were stopped and the first oil crisis in 1973 slammed the door on the whole debacle.\nWhat the new plans would look like today\nIt\u2019s amazing to think that all of that over there on the far side of The Lakes would be gone forever.\nWe are so incredibly lucky that none of it happened, but this was the kind of insane thinking that was the norm back then. Unfortunately, it\u2019s the norm in Copenhagen again today with the current politicians in City Hall, the National Parliament and the company overseeing all the new crazy shit: By & Havn.\nBy 1972, the pushback had grown so strong that a last gasp attempt to save the project was proposed. Same-same, but different. A tunnel beneath The Lakes instead of an elevated motorway. The people, however, didn\u2019t buy it. Time was running out for the Lake Ring project.\nEven back in 1965 there was increasing pushback from the public. One architect was the public face of the project and a massive fan of it: Ole N\u00f8rg\u00e5rd. He was quoted as saying this:\n\u201cCopenhagen in its development has reached a point where it is necessary to expand a network of motorways through the city to ensure its orbital functions. Motorways will change the city\u2019s appearance. If this change is to be for the better, then the normal fear of development must be replaced by the courage to control that fear.\u201d\nYeah. Okay, Boomer.\n\nSee?! Everything is going to okay! Hardly any cars!\nBut as the years progressed, he and other proponents had to change their approach and start selling it all differently and reassuring people that there would still be pedestrian access to the water. Well, in certain places, anyway.\nFervent support for the whole shebang from Samvirke magazine in 1967\nSome publications fervently supported the whole idea. They put an enormous amount of effort into a multi-page article singing the praises of the whole urban development plan for the city. Moving the airport to the island of Saltholm, parking garages in the N\u00f8rrebro neighbourhood, filling in the south of the harbour to create more land. And so on.\nIn this article you can read this:\n\u201cMost of us mourn when the city grows and obliterates accustomed landscapes, but the coming city will have totally new values.\nFuture generations will hopefully think that our age acted wisely and rightly when we finally pulled ourselves together and planned urban development.\u201d\nOh, boy.\n\nPolitiken newspaper (left) calls bullshit on the project. Ingeni\u00f8ren (right) is still hopeful\nIt was a national newspaper called Politiken who really added fuel to the fire of the protests in 1968 with an article entitled The Lake Ring \u2014 Fake News or Fact? They had previously been on board (HELLO, fascination bias) but with this article they called bullshit on the project. Other more conservative newspapers were still fans, but question marks started appearing.\nThere are still leftovers from the project in this city. Large buildings and widened roads. Most of them eyesores to this day. One particular leftover has to be the biggest regarding infrastructure. The motorway flyover named Bispeengbuen.\nAside: isn\u2019t it ironic that many large developments in the world are named after what they ended up killing? Bispeengen (Bishop\u2019s Meadow) was killed with the flyover. The Lake Ring would kill The Lakes. City Plan Vest would kill the west of the city. Even shopping malls adopt this sub-conscious naming concept. Here in Copenhagen, Fields Mall occupies the fields that used to be there. You can see what other malls eradicated \u2014 it\u2019s in the name: Fisketorvet (Fisherman\u2019s Square), Spinderiet (The Weavery), Waterfront. Same thing wherever you live.\n\nThe archaic flyover Bispeengbuen from 1972 \u2014 now and then\nAnyway, Bispeengbuen is today a piece of dinosaur infrastructure and a barrier between two thriving neighbourhoods. It was opened in August 1972 at a time when protests against the huge projects were reaching a peak.\n\nProtests against The Lake Ring project in the early 1970s\nAfter it opened, Copenhageners could see what the future might look like and the protests increased by a notch or two. No more wooden models to discuss. There was now concrete evidence \u2014 quite literally \u2014 that motorways through the city were probably a bad idea.\n\nLeft: Renderings of the plans to bring back the water. Right: Like Aarhus has done in their city centre\nThere is now a popular movement to remove this urban highway and to bring back the original stream currently buried in a tube beneath the cars. Like they\u2019ve done in other cities like Milan, Aarhus, Seoul, Utrecht, and so on.\nThe Seventies, man!\nIt\u2019s important to remember that it was also the early seventies back then \u2014 an age of radical social change. All these factors led to the Forum Line and the Lake Ring projects being put to bed in 1972 and 1973, respectively. And of course, without the Lake Ring, City Plan Vest was rendered irrelevant.\nAfter spending so much time researching these failed megaprojects, it is completely mind boggling to me to think about how close we were to having this negative, destructive urban planning forced down our throats here in Copenhagen. Other cities in the world were not as lucky.\nIt is also just as mind boggling to think about how there were humans living here in this city who thought this was a good idea. It was a different era, I know that. It was a different generation of planners and engineers doing what was considered normal back then.\nIt is of utmost importance, however, to point out that this is not only a tale of all those crazy people back in the day. This is, sadly, very relevant today. Megaprojects are once again being planned.\nThe 18 kilometre long Femern Tunnel to Germany \u2014 that the Germans never really wanted \u2014 or at least wanted Denmark to pay for.\nThe environmental catastrophe that is the artificial island of Lynetteholm.\n\nLeft: more artificial island south of the city. Right: plan for a new motorway (no trains) in blue\nAved\u00f8re Holme \u2014 the nine artificial industrial islands south of the city.\nThe Kattegatforbindelsen \u2014 a proposed motorway (no trains, just cars) connecting the island of Sj\u00e6lland with the Danish mainland.\nThe Harbour Tunnel that will feed more cars into Copenhagen.\nAmager F\u00e6lled \u2014 while not a megaproject per se, still a massive, full-frontal attack to secure development of some of the last remaining original nature and the rare species that inhabit it.\nThose crazy people from back in the day? They are back from the dead. With the same communication strategies, the same verbatim quotes and approach. The same arrogance towards the citizens of this city and this nation. From municipal and national politicians and from the company By og Havn. They all ridicule citizens who oppose these projects in interviews and op-eds. I\u2019ve experienced it myself.\nBut let\u2019s remember one thing. This cautionary tale about megaprojects that ended up dying should also serve as both a wake-up call and call-to-arms for modern Copenhageners. Megaprojects can \u2014 and should \u2014 die. Citizens can push back and decide the fate of their city, region and nation.\nKeep up the fight.", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 10, "created_time": 1648721543857, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Copenhagen", "Urban Planning", "Denmark", "Urbanism", "Engineering"]}, {"author": "Mikael Colville-Andersen", "post_id": "a8505ed04b9b", "user_id": "6867b839d77e", "title": "The Architecture of Mariupol\u200a\u2014\u200aand the legacy of Viktor Nielsen", "content": "The Architecture of Mariupol \u2014 and the legacy of Viktor Nielsen\nModern collage from Mariupol featuring the architect Victor Nielsen\nBack in 2020 I was a member of an architectural jury for a competition hosted by the City of Mariupol, Ukraine and organised by Canactions. It was an interesting and compelling competition not least because the city is right near the region invaded by Russia in 2014.\nThe entries were as positive and refreshing as you\u2019d expect in any architectural competition but that was amplified by the desire of Mariupol to work towards urban change and reinvent themselves through urban design and architecture. The many entries were all flavoured with optimism for the future and many incorporated a Ukrainian flair in the colours or the use of national symbolism.\nMessage from the Mayor of Mariupol about the competition in 2020\nAs I write this, the city of Mariupol is under siege by Russian invaders serving the dictatorial whims of a mad man in the Kremlin.

What lives have been destroyed by barbaric shelling.\nIn 2020, I spent a time google streetviewing myself up and down the streets of the city in order to get a feel for the place and the context of the competition site in relation to the city at large. Due to COVID restrictions back then, I was unable to travel to Mariupol to attend the awards ceremony. I regretted not having this opportunity because the city has a distant Danish architecture connection that captured my imagination.\nViktor Alexandrovich Nielsen.\nThe splendid addition of the middle name does little to mask the archetypal Danish name of Viktor Nielsen (1871\u20131949). Little is known about the details of this architect\u2019s life. The city archives were destroyed during the Second World War, including his diaries and sketchbooks, but in his career he managed to contribute to a wonderful architectural legacy in Mariupol.\nFrom what I\u2019ve been able to ascertain, Viktor Nielsen was from a Danish/German family who moved to Russia and settled in Saint Petersburg. He graduated from the Institute of Civil Engineers and went to work in the city of Rybinsk on the Volga River, where he designed and built a well-functioning city water supply system.\nThe City of Mariupol got wind of this and invited him to become the city architect in 1900 or 1901, when Nielsen was 29 years old. Mariupol had a serious issue regarding lack of clean drinking water, especially in the hot summers, so Nielsen was put to the task to improve water supply. It was no small feat and required considerable funding, including an application to the Ministry of the Interior to help cover the costs.\nNielsen was regarded as an outsider in the small city of 30,000 people. There was initial scepticism about this big city architect with a fancy education and not least the massive budget he proposed for the water supply system. Nevertheless, the funding was granted and the work began in 1906. In the same year, Nielsen was elected as a deputy to the Mariupol Duma (city council), which is clearly sign that he had managed to win over the locals. He also owned land \u2014 which was a sign that he had decided to invest in his own future in the city.\nThe city water supply system was completed in 1910 and by the next year, two-thirds of the city finally had reliable access to clean water. It was a massive success that made a huge impact on the quality of life in the city.\nNielsen was educated at a prestigious university and could have worked anywhere in the Russian Empire but for reasons we cannot know, Mariupol appealed to him. He settled down in a lavish home that he built himself, across from the City Gardens at 49 Semenyshyna Street, locally known as the \u201cHouse of the Weeping Nymphs\u201d.\nViktor Nielsen\u2019s mansion \u2014 The House of the Weeping Nymphs\nViktor Nielsen was influenced by the Vienna Secession and Art Nouveau. His mansion featured a high roof, splendid stucco work and patterned cornices. A decorative tower dominated one corner and a commanding view was to be had from the bay window. It was such an impressive home in this provincial outpost and the locals were enamoured with it.\nThe nickname \u201chouse of the weeping nymphs\u201d stems from a family tragedy. Nielsen dedicated the house to a daughter of his, who died of typhus. He designed a three-dimensional profile of a nymph on the building. When it rains, water flows down the face like tears \u2014 weeping for the dead daughter. Local superstition added to the storytelling legacy. It was said that when the weather was bad, crying is heard from inside the estate.\n\nThe \u201cLion House\u201d in Mariupol, by Viktor Nielsen. Photos by Evgeny Sosnovsky\nViktor Nielsen\u2019s first building in Mariupol was another house that he built for his family which was dubbed the Lion House by locals because of the many lion-themed mascarons on the fa\u00e7ade. For some reason, he didn\u2019t end up moving in and sold it instead to a Cossack officer before building his House of the Weeping Nymphs.\n\nLeft: The Radio Hub Building (1909) & Right: Pryazovskyi State Technical University (1911) Photo by Evgeny Sosnovsky\nDespite his family tragedy, Nielsen was now firmly settled in Mariupol and ready to begin building his architectural legacy. The list of buildings attributed to him is long, when you consider the size of the city back then: the Radio Hub building (1909), a diocesan school which later became the Pryazovskyi State Technical University (1911), Warehouse #7 and the Church of Constantine and Helena (1911). He also designed the school at the steel factory in the nearby city of Nikopol.\nChurch of Constantine and Helen (completed 1911) \u2014 destroyed in 1936 by the Soviets\nThe church was by far his grandest building but was destroyed in 1936. One building, however, would end up as his most enduring work and the most poignant landmark of his legacy in the city. The 33 meter tall Water Tower.\n\nVictor Nielsen\u2019s Water Tower in Mariupol (1908)\nWhile it served an important function in Nielsen\u2019s work on the water supply system, it quickly became an iconic structure in the heart of the city and has been lovingly cared for ever since. On the occasion of the city\u2019s 240th birthday, it was repurposed into a tourist centre, with event spaces and a coworking space.\nViktor Nielsen\u2019s mansion has never received the same care. It is privately-owned and the building and estate were squatted in the early 2000s. The tiled floor and wiring have long since been ripped out. In recent years, the city has been working on giving it historical status and either forcing the owner to restore it to its former glory or purchasing it.\nHis architectural legacy was firmly established in a relatively short period of time. He arrived in 1900 or 1901 and work on the water supply system started in 1906. Most of his most loved buildings were constructed before 1917 \u2014 a nine-year flurry of architectural design.\nEverything changed with the October Revolution and the formation of the Soviet State. Like many other architects of the age, Nielsen was regarded as a bourgeois tsarist and his ability to work was severely restricted. He was kicked out of his home when it was expropriated by the Soviets.\nFrom tenderly designed Art Nouveau structures like the water tower and the church, he was put to work making functional buildings like factories.\nIt was Stalin\u2019s Great Purge that forced the end to Viktor Nielsen\u2019s career as an architect. Starting in 1935, Stalin started to purge the Communist party of people he considered threats. The murderous brutality of the purges is well-documented but countless people were also simply removed from their professions.\nViktor Nielsen was no longer allowed to work as an architect and was sent to work in the technical department of the new Azovstal factory. In 1936, his Church of Constantine and Helen was razed to the ground by the Soviets. It must have been heart-wrenching to see such a spectacular building destroyed before your architect eyes.\nIn 1943, Nielsen\u2019s home and private archives were destroyed by fires caused by German soldiers and among the tragic losses was an album of sketches he made of the facades of the buildings and their surroundings which were the only visual documentation of many of the historic structures of the city.\nViktor Nielsen died in 1949.\n\n\nViktor Nielsen \u2014 symbol of Mariupol\nThe City of Mariupol insists on keeping his legacy alive, however. He has become a symbol of the city, with small caricatures based on one of the few photographs of the man placed around the city.\nThe architectural competition I worked on was also aptly named The Viktor Nielsen Open Competition. You can see the winners and runners up on the Canactions website.\nAs I write this, we\u2019re eleven days into the illegal invasion of Ukraine by Vladimir Putin and the future of Mariupol and countless Ukrainian cities is uncertain. Mariupol suffered horribly under the Soviets and Nazi Germany and now war has returned \u2014 right at a time when the city was planning a bright and better urban future for itself and its citizens. But neither the Soviets or the Nazis succeeded in erasing Viktor Nielsen\u2019s name from the history books. His legacy stubbornly exists.\nLives are being lost and destroyed in Mariupol as I write this. Buildings are being bombed indiscriminately. I feel helpless. Writing the first English article about a forgotten Russian architect of Danish descent who worked in an obscure city on the Azov Sea will have little effect. But while my relationship with the City of Mariupol may have been transient, it is nonetheless tangible to me. Now more than ever.\nStand with Ukraine.\n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\nI\u2019m a sucker for melancholy tales of prolific architects who are long forgotten but whose architectural legacy remains, like these two Italians on the island of Leros in Greece.\nThe Architecture of Lakki \u2014 Bold, Bizarre and Forgotten\nIt\u2019s one thing to stumble across a building that has slipped under the radar of time and recognition.

This isn\u2019t happening. I am successful and hot and can cook and yet somehow I am downloading an app that allows thousands of strangers to see my vacation photos. No. This cannot be happening.\nThe next first reaction, after downloading the app and realizing that men who are fifteen years older than you aren\u2019t interested but for some reason 23 year-olds are dying to meet you, is to continue to deny the situation. Did that 58 year-old really say \u201cno one over 35\u201d on his profile? Why do 23 year olds keep telling me that older women \u2018have their shit together?\u2019 No. This cannot be happening.\nDenial is a useful defense mechanism that protects against the immediate shock of online dating over 40, numbing you to the reality that none of the men on these apps seem to have jobs. You pretend that their invitations to meet at 2 in the afternoon Wednesday (really, they don\u2019t have jobs) didn\u2019t actually happen, or the phrase \u201clooking for someone who takes care of herself\u201d isn\u2019t really just code for \u201cthin.\u201d For most women over 40 on dating apps, this stage is a brief and temporary response, designed to carry you through the first few weeks of abject humiliation.\nAnger\nAs the protective effects of denial and isolation begin to wear, reality hits. You are not ready for this. You are hot, smart, successful and adventurous. In a previous life you hung out with diplomats and floated down quiet rivers in Thailand. You\u2019ve met two presidents, and both looked deeply into your eyes. You read the New Yorker and the Economist and you know exactly why trickle down economics didn\u2019t work. You do pilates and yoga and have a cool dog and make an incredible bolognese sauce, and yet here you are: swiping right on men with beer bellies who can\u2019t spell and wear jorts. Un-ironically.\nThe intense emotion that was contained by denial is now presenting itself as white hot anger. One minute you were a 24-year-old in grad school with abs that came naturally and no need to buy KY Jelly, and boom! The next minute Bob from El Segundo just mansplained hybrid cars to you.\nYour anger may be directed at the men on Bumble, or at your friends over brunch after they innocently ask if you \u201cdid anything fun last night.\u201d You feel guilty at lashing out at the strange men and your friends, and this in turn makes you more angry.\nBut remember, online dating is a personal process that has no end in sight, nor one \u201cright\u201d way to do it.\nYou have the most anger for your one friend who told you to go on the app in the first place, but somehow refused to set you up with her adorable but shy brother. In any event, do not hesitate to ask any of your friends to fuck right off, because unless they are swiping endlessly while stuck in traffic, they really don\u2019t know how horrible it really all is.\nBargaining\nThe normal reaction to feelings of helplessness and despair at the plethora of jobless mansplainers (who aren\u2019t swiping right on you anyway), is a need to regain control through a series of \u201cif only\u201d statements, such as:\nIf only I had just married that pothead Marty, even though he was secretly against gay marriage and once cooked pork chops in cream of mushroom soup with jalape\u00f1os (just a hypothetical).\nIf only only I had agreed to go out with Jared, that nice shy scientist who was too nerdy at the time but is now on sabbatical in Copenhagen.\nThis is an attempt to bargain. Secretly you try to make a deal with God or whoever in an attempt to make a soul crushing endeavor somehow minimally less bleak. Guilt goes hand in hand with bargaining. You start to believe there was actually something you could have done to avoid being over 40 swiping endlessly in the glow of your phone, while your three rescue dogs snore nearby. (But really, there wasn\u2019t).\nThere is, of course, another type of bargaining that goes along with online dating. After finally scheduling a first date, you\u2019ll realize that you have only one wild and precious life, and it should not be spent driving to Northridge to have sugary drinks at Se\u00f1or Frogs with some dude who posts only photos of grilled steaks on Instagram: Please God, let him be the one to flake. For Chrissakes, does he really think I have nothing better to do on a Thursday night than sit in traffic on the 405? When am I supposed to sleep?\nDepression\nThere are two types of depression associated with online dating while over 40. The first one is a reaction to the reality that these losers aren\u2019t interested in you either, and by extension the reality that yeah, you really might die alone.\nSadness and regret predominate this type of depression. You worry about the costs of home healthcare workers and whether you\u2019ll be lonely when you outlive all your friends and pets. Is it ethical to get a pet when I\u2019m 80? you wonder. What if they outlive me?\nYou worry that everything was supposed to be completely fucking different and somehow, inexplicably, it isn\u2019t. This phase may be made easier by the knowledge that in the end, we all die alone, married or not.\nThe second type of depression is more subtle and more private. It is your quiet preparation for being single forever. You make your sofa even more comfortable and subscribe to Amazon Prime, Netflix, and Hulu while still keeping your cable so you can watch Bravo, because fuck it: there is no one to impress and there never will be. You buy a box of Ocho chocolate peanut butter bars and allow yourself one every night. You eat carbs in public. You go to bed at 9.\nAcceptance\nReaching this stage of dating online after 40 is a gift. This phase is marked by a calm sense of withdrawal. It is peaceful. You delete the app. You buy some herbs for your garden and spend all day Sunday planting them, talking to the dog and making a huge pot of spaghetti with plain tomato sauce. You talk to your favorite cousin on the phone and laugh, and realize wait a second, I\u2019m happy. You regain your dignity and grace. You limit your social interaction to people you actually like, and come to the realization that brunch food is awful and always has been.\nBut to get to this place, you had to go through all the stages of online dating \u2014 there are no shortcuts to coping with this deeply personal and unique experience.", "comment_count": 19, "like_count": 1901, "created_time": 1573266383330, "comment": [{"user_id": "b41e39525113", "comment_time": 1573266383330, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "cda5002daa86", "comment_time": 1573742810374, "comment": "Well, there\u2019s always humor.

If they call to sell you \u201ccheap drugs,\u201d it\u2019s sometimes fun to tell them you\u2019re in the market for some hemlock.\nWhy can\u2019t we stop these calls? Because no one is actually steering this ship, that\u2019s why. Do you remember when you realized that maybe no one was in charge, and that adults weren\u2019t really that capable after all? And yet when things go south, I still look around for an adult. Did I mention that I\u2019m 51?\nEverything is upside down and nothing makes sense. A few weeks ago, I opened my front door and found three tiny takeout bags from McDonald\u2019s, with a single cookie in each bag, delivered by DoorDash. Some of the bags had salt packets added, some had sugar. They were delivered in the wee hours of the morning, one after midnight, one after 1:00 a.m, one after 2:00 a.m. I did not order these single cookie bags in the middle of the night, but yet here they were. From McDonald\u2019s, of all places, where you are definitely not allowed to eat, but everyone secretly does anyway.\nI called DoorDash to figure out what happened. You may be wondering why I bothered \u2014 who cares if there are three cookies delivered to your door in the middle of the night, in separate bags, one after the other? But to me it felt ominous, like someone was testing whether my dog Fish would get out of bed and bark in the middle of the night. (He won\u2019t. Despite showing a willingness to rip people\u2019s throat out during the day, Fish knows when he is off the clock.)\nI explained the situation the best I could \u2014 the three tiny bags, not meant for me. Or maybe meant for me by the serial killer who was testing out Fish\u2019s limits, but three little bags that I definitely did not order. I gave them the order number on each bag, and this is when I found out that DoorDash cannot track orders by the order number.\nYup. You may be wondering: what is an order number for, if not to track an order? I can assure you I had the same exact, apparently cosmic, question. After wasting some of my wild and precious life on the phone with DoorDash, I have now accepted that I will never know the answer. They just don\u2019t track orders with order numbers, okay? You might as well ask DoorDash how many angels can dance on the head of a pin.\nBut who cares about the midnight cookies anyway? I aged out of the serial killer victim demographic long ago. The most likely explanation is that someone extremely stoned with a traumatizing case of the munchies, tried to show some restraint and ordered just one, single cookie. When that cookie failed to arrive (because their cookie was mistakenly delivered to my house) they ordered another single cookie. And when that cookie didn\u2019t arrive, they ordered yet another single cookie, and when that cookie didn\u2019t arrive, they finally gave up, and honestly the whole thing breaks my heart wide open. Here we are, squirrelled away from one another, desperate for cookies. One person high as a kite, and another so paranoid that she thought the cookies were a precursor to her own murder. Same mental decline, different address.\nWhen did we start to unravel? I can\u2019t pinpoint it, but I try all the time. In the 1990s it seemed like everything was gonna be great, like we were all on the cusp of something bold. But there were hints that we were going off the rails. There was the genocide in Rwanda, and a UN commander, Rom\u00e9o Dallaire, who was on the ground desperately faxing the UN in New York, asking for help to stop the slaughter, but they said no. Let\u2019s repeat: there was this guy in Rwanda, Dallaire, who saw the bloodshed coming \u2014 they were broadcasting instructions on how to kill your neighbor on the radio, after all \u2014 and he faxed his bosses at the UN for help, and they said no.\nUnsurprisingly, Dallaire ended up back in Canada with a severe case of PTSD and a drinking problem, which is about as healthy a response you can expect, if you think about it. I think about Dallaire a lot. Sometimes I think he\u2019s patient zero in our collective mental breakdown. His trauma went viral.\nToday I brought Fish to a cafe by the LA River, where abandoned homeless tents floated next to Mallard ducks. There was a woman there muttering to herself with a huge German Shepherd off leash, and when I asked her to put him on a leash, she screamed \u201cmy dog is a good dog!\u201d and without missing a beat I screamed back \u201cgood for you!\u201d and nobody blinked an eye and we all just continued to sip our lattes. Just a normal day at a cafe in Los Angeles, two unhinged dog-ladies screaming at each other.\nBut what do you expect when everyone hates everyone? Most of my friends have stopped dating completely \u2014 and we consider the ones who haven\u2019t truly insane \u2014 because the idea of meeting a stranger is appalling. I think there might have been a time when the idea of a conversation with a new person sounded fun, but does anyone remember when that was?\nWe now barely tolerate each other, but who can blame us? I have friends who went to school at places like Princeton, who have fallen victim to multi-level marketing schemes and are now trying to sell me powdered collagen with a straight face. Drivers in Los Angeles lean on their horns if you don\u2019t turn left the second they think you should, and they speed up when they see you want to change lanes, just because. Russian soldiers are gang-raping Ukrainian women, and people are rooting for Putin, the translucent war criminal. I don\u2019t know if we can come back from this, but we gotta try.\nWhen I was a kid in the 1970s, we went out to dinner at the local Chinese restaurant with other families. Inevitably, the kids would misbehave, by spinning the lazy Susan too fast or sticking chopsticks up our nose, and the adults would send us outside until we could pull it together. We were five or six, but we would shuffle outside onto a busy LA street, and hang out until the adults noticed we were gone. If a parent did that now, they\u2019d be arrested, or the very least, recorded, shamed, maybe doxxed. We live for that shit now, for ratting people out, for throwing people into the center of the town square for bad parenting or a meltdown on a bad day.\nBut someone does need to send us outside, so we can stop throwing chopsticks or screaming while we run around the table. We need a stern grandma to tell us to pull our shit together already, to remind us that she survived the war by walking across Europe, eating potatoes and snow, so we can sit still and be nice to each other.\nI\u2019m praying for her arrival. While I wait, I am going to execute my signature move and crawl into bed. And maybe order a single cookie.\nIf you want to spend your one wild and precious life reading unlimited Medium articles, you can sign up here.", "comment_count": 49, "like_count": 4007, "created_time": 1648762609539, "comment": [{"user_id": "b41e39525113", "comment_time": 1648762609539, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "38919a8f7285", "comment_time": 1648899349759, "comment": "You are a gift.

Who knows? You can read about why I\u2019m giving up here, and the previous week of saying fuck it here. (The term \u201cweek\u201d is used loosely).\nI haven\u2019t been writing because I just don\u2019t wanna. Not sure what to say about that, other than to say that I don\u2019t wanna. I have a vague voice chirping in the back of my head that I should finish what I started (namely, this weird Diary of Surrender project) and I do agree with the chirping voice, but I\u2019m at a point that if I don\u2019t want to do a thing I\u2019m not doing the thing.\nOne the one hand, this is freedom. On the other hand, this is stupid: I still haven\u2019t paid a traffic ticket I got more than a month ago because I don\u2019t wanna. To be fair, I tried once online, but it wasn\u2019t in the system yet. I looked again a week later, it wasn\u2019t there, and then I just decided to stop looking for it at all. I recognize this is bad. But like writing, I just don\u2019t wanna look a third time.\nSo I\u2019ve just been sort of drifting around, doing the next indicated action. Working. Going to a Bat Mitzvah. Exercising, but only when it\u2019s super convenient. Watching an obscene amount of television. Just sort of drifting, thinking about all the things I should do but don\u2019t: refill the hummingbird feeders, start cooking again, start painting again, taking Fish on longer hikes, cleaning out my closet (why do I have so many clothes?), and of course, writing. But like I said \u2014 I just don\u2019t wanna.\nBut something happened on Monday that was so on the nose of the giving up theme, that I had to document it, so here I am writing, even though I don\u2019t wanna. Sometimes I wonder if this project has made me kick my surrendering up a notch, just to have material for this series, like how people studied by anthropologists act differently, knowing that they\u2019re being watched. If I\u2019m doing that, I really chose the wrong theme. Next year it should be something like Diary of Becoming a Triathlete or Diary of Learning How to Rock Climb, or Diary of Having a Better Attitude. But alas, here we are.\nThis is how Monday was supposed to go: I would drop Fish off at his daycare (which he absolutely loves), I would get a manicure/pedicure, and then meet a professional organizer at my Mom\u2019s house to continue cleaning out her garage. Then, if I had time, I would go to hot yoga and then come home and cook for the week.\nThis is what actually happened on Monday: I dropped Fish off at daycare, went to the manicure place, got a call that Fish had attacked another dog (as Fish\u2019s lawyer, I can tell you that this was not entirely his fault). Fish got dropped off at home with a message that he was suspended indefinitely, the Los Angeles rain got ridiculous, I cancelled the professional organizer but paid her $300 anyway because I had missed the cancellation window, I changed into pajamas, took a Xanax, and watched television all day, while snacking on BBQ potato chips and Ritter chocolate with hazelnuts. All this happened before 12 p.m.\nI stayed in bed all day. I passed out for part of it, Fish next to me. The only detail about this that does not scream totally giving up were my very chic purple velvet pajamas. But otherwise: total surrender.\nFish getting kicked out of daycare just sent me over the edge. We\u2019re all going back to the office, and I had a perfect plan how to organize my life for this new shift. I would drop Fish off at school around 7 a.m., get to work by 8, and then have him take the daycare\u2019s shuttle home at night, while I went swimming or to yoga. When making this plan I had grumbled a bit that it was like I had a kid without wanting a kid \u2014 all my other dogs didn\u2019t need a schedule like this \u2014 but I was also impressed with the plan\u2019s elegance.\nBut now that plan was out the window, and I had to figure out how to take care of Fish while also going back to the office, which requires wearing a bra and makeup and hard pants and it was all too much, so I crawled into bed, drugged, munching on chocolate, telling myself that at least the hazelnuts had some nutritional value. As I laid there, I thought about what everyone was talking about \u2014 Will Smith slapping our Lord and Savior Chris Rock, because of pretty funny, if slightly cruel, joke. Apparently, during the break Denzel Washington reminded Smith that \u201cthe Devil comes for you when you\u2019re at your highest point.\u201d\nPutting aside for a moment that after Smith slapped Rock, a bunch of rich, out-of-touch people gave Smith a standing ovation, proving that as a society we can\u2019t even suspend reality long enough to have a broadcast about total and utter meaninglessness without the violence that permeates everything seeping in, I was fascinated by Washington\u2019s admonishment. It intuitively checks out \u2014 I often think that people who fly too close to the sun get taken down a notch.\nI was thinking about this while licking chocolate off my fingers, the Xanax kicking in, then it occurred to me: If the Devil comes for you at your highest moment, who comes for you when you\u2019re in bed by 12 p.m on a weekday with BBQ potato chip dust everywhere? I was in danger of a lot of things at that moment, but having the Devil pay me a visit was definitely not one of them. If he passed by me, he probably thought, She\u2019s good. I\u2019ll check back if she ever gets out of bed.\nI did drag myself out of bed eventually and even went into the office yesterday. My heart still breaks for Fish, who loves going to daycare so much I can barely think about his future without crying. Then I have to remind myself that I never promised him a sadness-free, disappointment-free life. No one can promise that, other than the Devil.\nIf you want to spend your one wild and precious life reading unlimited Medium articles, you can sign up here.", "comment_count": 15, "like_count": 1048, "created_time": 1648401680351, "comment": [{"user_id": "b41e39525113", "comment_time": 1648401680351, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "e49dc4e02d61", "comment_time": 1648657292330, "comment": "What\u2019s not to love here.

Once remembering my dead dog, Millie (grief), once trying to reschedule a doctor\u2019s appointment for my mother (frustration), and once trying to ask a certified respiratory therapist a question about my new CPAP machine (frustration). No matter how many times I asked the same very simple question, she answered a different question. After about five go-rounds of this, I burst into tears.\nShe looked surprised, but I wasn\u2019t. I now cry whenever I\u2019m frustrated, and can\u2019t control it. It happens every time, whether the frustration is big or small, no exceptions. Today I cried because I was asked to re-write something at work, and tomorrow I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll cry when I try to pay a traffic ticket online. It\u2019s just how it is now.\nI\u2019ve always felt the urge to cry when frustrated, but I was able to keep it under control for years. I\u2019d feel the tears gathering behind my eyeballs, my voice about to change, and I would give myself a drill-sergeanty internal pep talk that went something like, Jesus Christ, pull it together for G-d\u2019s sake. And this usually worked. When it didn\u2019t, I would gulp water, because the swallowing mechanism knocks out the about-to-cry mechanism. (Take that tip to the bank, ladies: if you work somewhere that frowns on crying, keep a bottle of water on your desk at all times).\nBut that skill-set has now completely disappeared. Although I know correlation doesn\u2019t equal causation, it\u2019s hard not to blame the last two years of abject fear, confusion and upheaval for this new disability. I now feel like a big open blister. Or a jellyfish? I feel like I once had a shell, and now I don\u2019t, but I\u2019m definitely supposed to have a shell. Where is my shell?\nThe embarrassing thing is that I had it pretty easy during the pandemic, considering. I never got COVID. I don\u2019t know anyone who died of COVID. My dad did get COVID on my 50th birthday, and I spent that day screaming and crying at the hospital staff (sorry) because I was convinced he was going to die, but then he didn\u2019t die. Now he has a new girlfriend at his assisted living facility and is doing push ups to impress her. So it all turned out fine.\nI didn\u2019t lose my job, or my house, or really anything during the last two years. I loved working from home. So I feel sort guilty and precious claiming that the last two years screwed me up so badly that I can\u2019t even make a phone call to a customer service without crying.\nBut I can\u2019t. Perhaps if I took to my bed all day and just pet the dog, I could manage to not to cry. But if I have to function, or interact, or accomplish things, then it\u2019s guaranteed that I will cry. Recently I went to visit MAGA Man for two days in Dallas, and I only cried on one day \u2014 when I was explaining something to him over shredded pork nachos \u2014 but I can\u2019t even remember why. Crying has become that normal. Trying to remember why I cried is like trying to remember why I sneezed.\nAll this crying makes me seem unhinged, and this is really inconvenient. People react to you differently when they think you\u2019re completely fucking nuts, or unhinged. But I\u2019m not really out of control \u2014 I don\u2019t think? \u2014 I just have an involuntary physical reaction, like sweating or a nervous twitch, and it just happens to show up every single day. I\u2019ve just sprung a leak.\nOr more specifically, I\u2019ve sprung an unfixable leak. I\u2019ve tried to fix it. My friend\u2019s brother is a psychologist, and he insists that crying is just like any other involuntary physical reaction, like having to go pee. According to him, you can train your body to hold it in.\nBut no, you can\u2019t. Or at least I can\u2019t. Using myself as a case study of one, I am here to report that you cannot hold tears in, like pee. There are no muscles to engage to stop the flow of tears. But this doesn\u2019t change the fact that people really, really, don\u2019t want you to cry in front of them. It annoys them a lot, and then you have to go about the business of proving that you are not nuts, that you are reliable and even chill. This rarely works.\nSpookily, I think I can pinpoint the exact moment during the pandemic when I sprang the leak. It wasn\u2019t that early on, because we were all so stunned and confused and squirreled away in our own homes that there wasn\u2019t much to be frustrated about. I spent March 2020 through June of 2020 pretty tear-free. Then in June of 2020 my father had to go to assisted living, and my mother had a stroke, and although I cried a lot that month \u2014 and even threw up a few times from the stress \u2014 that wasn\u2019t the cause of the leak-springing.\nThe leak sprung later, in August of 2020, when I recruited an ex-boyfriend M to go with me to a Dionysian weekend at a fancy hotel on the California coast. M and I always had a deeply unhealthy relationship, filled with screaming and slamming doors, but on the other hand we always loved getting drunk together and we had great sex \u2014 like any typical toxic relationship. After the Sturm and Drang of dealing with the slow death march of two parents, I needed a weekend of getting blotto and ravaged, and at least I was accustomed to M and he was game.\nThe plan was to go hiking in the redwoods, but they were on fire. This annoyed M, who really wanted to show me the redwoods he grew up hiking in. (I didn\u2019t bother to explain that as a child of California I had hiked the same redwoods). Miraculously, we managed to find a hike that was not on fire, and off we went.\nIt\u2019s all sort of a blur, but it went down like this: I spoke to a park ranger for too long, I stared at a banana slug for too long, I made M. sit on a tree that looked like a couch for too long, and all of a sudden he was yelling at me in the middle of the trail. Screaming, in fact. Really loud.\nHe was also \u2018shrooming. As someone who has never done \u2018shrooms, I have no idea whether they made the screaming worse, but they certainly didn\u2019t make it better. Around the fifteen second mark of the screaming, I burst into tears. And then I kept crying. And then I realized I couldn\u2019t stop.\nI sent M ahead of me on the hike \u2014 he\u2019s much taller than me and it didn\u2019t take him long to disappear in front of me \u2014 and then I hiked far behind him, alone. We were all still wearing masks at the time, even outside, even alone, so I hiked, cried into my mask, and hyperventilated. I tried, really hard, to absorb the nature, to see the redwoods looking down on me, to see the cobwebs in the big prehistoric looking ferns, to find those weirdo yellow banana slugs, to focus on the white little butterflies everywhere. But it didn\u2019t work; I couldn\u2019t stop crying.\nEventually M. circled back and came across me sitting on a log. He started yelling again, this time his ire was directed at me because I had apparently, at this point, been crying for three hours. \u201cYou\u2019re abusing me by crying,\u201d he yelled. \u201cIt\u2019s involuntary!\u201d I hiccuped \u201cit\u2019s a response to your yelling! It\u2019s a biological response, like sweating.\u201d I paused. \u201cScreaming at me, however, is a choice,\u201d I seethed. M. did not appreciate this analysis. \u201cYou mean to tell me that you think I have a choice about screaming but you don\u2019t about crying?\u201d\nAnd then it hit me. M. really thought that I could turn my tears on and off at will. Which is, of course, nuts. But to be fair, people do believe that you can do something about being such a sensitive flower, so M. isn\u2019t really alone. And I agree, in a way. I would love to have my shell back, I would love to have grit again, I would love to fix this leak already.\nI would love to fix my leak not only so I don\u2019t seem insane, but because I\u2019ve started to treat myself to false eyelashes, and crying every day really undermines this investment. The falsies can withstand one cry per day, but if I have a few double or triple-cry days in a row, they are toast. They become unstuck and float across my cheeks like little insects.\nToday I texted my lash person to tell her that I\u2019ll need a whole new set when I see her next, because yesterday was a triple-cry day. I may not be able to fix The Great Leak of August of 2020, but if I\u2019m going to be seen as perpetually out of control, I might as well look pretty.\nIf you want to spend your one wild and precious life reading unlimited Medium articles, you can sign up here.", "comment_count": 26, "like_count": 1161, "created_time": 1647397072926, "comment": [{"user_id": "b41e39525113", "comment_time": 1647397072926, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "eb9d779d3f10", "comment_time": 1647426965342, "comment": "*Sits down next to you, hands you a tissue, says nothing."}, {"user_id": "fc703a3a6734", "comment_time": 1647453184849, "comment": "I've never behaved like this on shrooms.

The key is to become strong in the broken places.\nPhoto by Scott Rodgerson on Unsplash\nThere is a line attributed to Ernest Hemingway \u2014 that the first draft of everything is shit \u2014 which, of all the beautiful things Hemingway has written, applies most powerfully to the ending of A Farewell to Arms. There are no fewer than 47 alternate endings to the book. Each one is a window into how much he struggled to get it right. The pages, which now sit in the Hemingway Collection at the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston, show Hemingway writing the same passages over and over. Sometimes the wording was nearly identical, sometimes whole sections were cut out. He would, at one moment of desperation, even send pages to his rival, F. Scott Fitzgerald, for notes.\nOne passage clearly challenged Hemingway more than the others. It comes at the end of the book when Catherine has died after delivering their stillborn son and Frederic is struggling to make sense of the tragedy that has just befallen him. \u201cThe world breaks everyone,\u201d he wrote, \u201cand afterward many are strong at the broken places. But those that will not break it kills.\u201d\nIn different drafts, he would experiment with shorter and longer versions. In the handwritten draft he worked on with F. Scott Fitzgerald, for instance, Hemingway begins instead with \u201cYou learn a few things as you go along\u2026\u201d before beginning with his observation about how the world breaks us. In two typed manuscript pages, Hemingway moved the part about what you learn elsewhere and instead added something that would make the final book \u2014 \u201cIf people bring so much courage to this world the world has to kill them to break them, so of course it kills them.\u201d\nMy point in showing this part of Hemingway\u2019s process isn\u2019t just to definitively disprove the myth \u2014 partly of Hemingway\u2019s own making \u2014 that great writing is something that flows intuitively from the brain of a genius (no, great writing is a slow, painstaking process, even for geniuses). My point is to give some perspective on one of Hemingway\u2019s most profound insights, one that he, considering his tragic suicide some 32 years later, struggled to fully integrate into his life.\nThe world is a cruel and harsh place. One that, for at least 4.5 billion years, is undefeated. From entire species of apex predators to Hercules to Hemingway himself, it has been home to incredibly strong and powerful creatures. And where are they now? Gone. Dust. As the Bible verse, which Hemingway opens another one of his books with (and which inspired its title) goes:\n\u201cOne generation passeth away, and another generation cometh: but the earth abideth forever\u2026The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to the place where he arose\u2026\u201d\nThe world is undefeated. So really then, for all of us, life is not a matter of \u201cwinning\u201d but of surviving as best we can \u2014 of breaking and enduring rather than bending the world to our will the way we sometimes suspect we can when we are young and arrogant.\nI write about Stoicism, a philosophy of self-discipline and strength. Stoicism promises to help you build an \u201cinner citadel,\u201d a fortress of power and resilience that prepares you for the difficulties of the world. But many people misread this, and assume that Stoicism is a philosophy designed to make you superhuman \u2014 to help you eliminate pesky emotions and attachments, and become invincible.\nThis is wrong. Yes, Stoicism is partly about making it so you don\u2019t break as easily \u2014 so you are not so fragile that the slightest change in fortune wrecks you. At the same time, it\u2019s not about filling you with so much courage and hubris that you think you are unbreakable. Only the proud and the stupid think that is even possible.\nInstead, the Stoic seeks to develop the skills \u2014 the true strength \u2014 required to deal with a cruel world.\nSo much of what happens is out of our control: We lose people we love. We are financially ruined by someone we trusted. We put ourselves out there, put every bit of our effort into something, and are crushed when it fails. We are drafted to fight in wars, to bear huge taxes or familial burdens. We are passed over for the thing we wanted so badly. This can knock us down and hurt us. Yes.\nStoicism is there to help you recover when the world breaks you and, in the recovering, to make you stronger at a much, much deeper level. The Stoic heals themselves by focusing on what they can control: Their response. The repairing. The learning of the lessons. Preparing for the future.\nThis is not an idea exclusive to the West. There is a form of Japanese art called Kintsugi, which dates back to the 15th century. In it, masters repair broken plates and cups and bowls, but instead of simply fixing them back to their original state, they make them better. The broken pieces are not glued together, but instead fused with a special lacquer mixed with gold or silver. The legend is that the art form was created after a broken tea bowl was sent to China for repairs. But the returned bowl was ugly \u2014 the same bowl as before, but cracked. Kintsugi was invented as a way to turn the scars of a break into something beautiful.\nYou can see in this tea bowl, which dates to the Edo period and is now in the Freer Gallery, how the gold seams take an ordinary bowl and add to it what look like roots, or even blood vessels. This plate, also from the Edo period, was clearly a work of art in its original form. Now it has subtle gold filling on the edges where it was clearly chipped and broken by use. This dark tea bowl, now in the Smithsonian, is accented with what look like intensely real lightning bolts of gold. The bowl below it shows that more than just precious metals can improve a broken dish, as the artist clearly inserted shards of an entirely different bowl to replace the original\u2019s missing pieces.\nIn Zen culture, impermanence is a constant theme. They would have agreed with Hemingway that the world tries to break the rigid and the strong. We are like cups \u2014 the second we are made we are simply waiting to be shattered \u2014 by accident, by malice, by stupidity or bad luck. The Zen solution to this perilous situation is to embrace it, to be okay with the shattering, perhaps even to seek it out. The idea of wabi-sabi is precisely that. Coming to terms with our imperfections and weaknesses and finding beauty in that.\nSo both East and West \u2014 Stoicism and Buddhism \u2014 arrive at similar insights. We\u2019re fragile, they both realize. But out of this fragility, one of the philosophies realizes there is the opportunity for beauty. Hemingway\u2019s prose rediscovers these insights and fuses them into something both tragic and breathtaking, empowering and humbling. The world will break us. It breaks everyone. It always has and always will.\nYet\u2026\nThe author will struggle with the ending of their book and want to quit. The recognition we sought will not come. The insurance settlement we so desperately needed will be rejected. The presentation we practiced for will begin poorly and be beset by technical difficulties. The friend we cherished will betray us. The haunting scene in A Farewell to Arms can happen, a child stillborn and a wife lost in labor \u2014 and still tragically happens far too often, even in the developed world.\nThe question is, as always, what will we do with this? How will we respond?\nBecause that\u2019s all there is. The response.\nThis is not to dismiss the immense difficulty of any of these ordeals. It is rather, to first, be prepared for them \u2014 humble and aware that they can happen. Next, it is the question: Will we resist breaking? Or will we accept the will of the universe and seek instead to become stronger where we were broken?\nDeath or Kintsugi? Fragile or, to use that wonderful phrase from Nassim Taleb, Antifragile?\nNot unbreakable. Not resistant. Because those that cannot break, cannot learn, and cannot be made stronger for what happened.\nThose that will not break are the ones who the world kills.\nNot unbreakable. Instead, unruinable.", "comment_count": 65, "like_count": 28024, "created_time": 1527686110385, "comment": [{"user_id": "2e2701ae378f", "comment_time": 1527686110385, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "f2aaba3c6502", "comment_time": 1527991130035, "comment": "Day-am, but you\u2019re good.

It\u2019s proof of their hard work, their dedication, their determination.\nMe?\nI\u2019m prouder of the exact opposite.\nDespite producing over a dozen books, writing my daily emails for Daily Stoic and Daily Dad, reading books to recommend to my Reading List Email each month, opening and operating The Painted Porch Book Shop, and spending lots of time with my wife and kids \u2014 I\u2019ve never pulled an all-nighter. My writing pace is not fueled by stimulants. My productivity is not dependent on adrenaline. My work doesn\u2019t interfere with my sleep. The only thing that has ever kept me up and busy in the middle of the night have been my young children.\nIn the military they speak of sleep discipline\u2013meaning it\u2019s something you have to be good at, you have to be conscious of, something you can\u2019t let slip. We only have so much energy for our work, for our relationships, for ourselves. A smart person knows this and guards it carefully. A smart person knows that getting their 7\u20138 hours of sleep every night does not affect their output, it contributes crucially to their best work.\nSo in this article, I am going to give you the 13 strategies that have been the secret to my success. Some of them you may have come by before. Others you probably haven\u2019t. But all of them work.\nBeware Burnout\nArianna Huffington quietly grew The Huffington Post into a behemoth with some 200 million unique visitors a month and 17 international editions. Her stake in Huffington Post was worth an estimated $21 million. But for a time, Arianna\u2019s wealth and power came at the expense of living a good life. After years of working upwards of 18-hour days seven days a week, the sleep tax collectors showed up. Arianna was in her home office when she collapsed, hit her head on her desk, broke a cheekbone, and woke up in a pool of her own blood. At the hospital, doctors ran several tests. Brain MRI. CAT scans. Heart sonograms. Her diagnosis? Burnout.\nBut unlike so many overworked people, however, Arianna was able to look in the mirror after this harrowing incident and do what too many are unable to do: she changed. She realized that life was about more than just doing, that there was no glamor in working oneself to the bone, trading sleep for an extra conference call or a few minutes on television or a meeting with an important person. So, despite being at her peak financially and professionally, she left The Huffington Post, went looking for what she would call the \u201cthird metric\u201d of success, and launched Thrive Global, where she\u2019s brought the resources of both science and philosophical wisdom to combat the rising epidemic of stress and burnout.\nNear the end of his life, Marcus Aurelius sat down and wrote about what he learned from the mentor who most shaped his life: his adopted step-father Antoninus. Antoninus worked hard, Marcus wrote, but he also made sure \u201cto take adequate care of himself\u2026With the result that he hardly ever needed medical attention, or drugs or any sort of salve or ointment.\u201d Marcus said that life is short and if we practice bad habits, if we don\u2019t take care of ourselves, if we aren\u2019t willing to change, we will surely shorten that time.\nYou Are Not An Exception\nPeople say, I do perfectly fine on four or five hours of sleep. No, you don\u2019t. I\u2019m an exception. No, you\u2019re not.\nIn a study by a team of scientists at the Division of Sleep and Chronobiology in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania, participants were divided into four groups: one was sleep deprived for up to 88 hours, one group slept for four hours a night, one group slept for six hours a night, and one group slept for eight hours a night. There were two important findings. First, the performance of the groups who slept four and six hours was as impaired as the sleep deprived group. Second, when asked, all participants grossly miscalculated how impaired they were.\nAs Dr. Thomas Roth, the Director of the Sleep Disorders and Research Center at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, put it, \u201cThe number of people who can survive on five hours of sleep or less without any impairment, expressed as a percent of the population, and rounded to a whole number, is zero.\u201d Or if not zero, close enough to zero that we can assume it doesn\u2019t include you.\nSleep With Your Phone In The Other Room\nSen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska is known for giving his young staffers old-school alarm clocks \u2014 not because he wants to make sure they\u2019re on time for work, but so they don\u2019t have an excuse to sleep with their phone on the nightstand. If you have an alarm that\u2019s not your clock app, your phone can go in the other room, and if your phone is in the other room, you can\u2019t check it at night.\nThis means you won\u2019t know if you get a text message or an email. It means you won\u2019t be tempted to scroll through social media. It means you won\u2019t be staring at a screen that are, as Matthew Walker writes in Why We Sleep, \u201cartificially forcing us awake, thereby masking our natural tiredness at night, [which] keeps people awake for longer, and makes falling asleep more difficult.\u201d\nWake Up Early\nI have written many times about the power of waking up early. The mornings are the most productive hours of the day \u2014 before the interruptions, before the distractions, before the rest of the world gets up and going too. Early, we are free. Hemingway would talk about how he\u2019d get up early because early, there was \u201cno one to disturb you and it is cool or cold and you come to your work and warm as you write.\u201d Toni Morrison found she was just more confident in the early morning, before the day had exacted its toll and while the mind was fresh. Like most of us, she realized she was just \u201cnot very bright or very witty or very inventive after the sun goes down.\u201d Who can be? After a day of banal conversations, frustrations, mistakes and exhaustion.\nAnd of course, when you get up with the sun, you are more likely to wind down with the sun. It was one of Seneca\u2019s observations: we were made to follow the rhythm of the sun. \u201cWe are more industrious, and we are better men if we anticipate the day and welcome the dawn,\u201d he wrote, \u201cbut we are base churls if we lie dozing when the sun is high in the heavens, or if we wake up only when noon arrives.\u201d If you want the secret to success, if you want to start executing at a higher level, then you have to get in the habit of waking up early. You have to come to the realization that you are at your best when you are in rhythm with the sun.\nStrenuous Exercise Every Day\nI take a walk and go for a run just about every day. It\u2019s not about burning calories or getting the heart rate up or training for a marathon. \u201cIt is indeed foolish,\u201d Seneca wrote, \u201cto work hard over developing the muscles and broadening the shoulders and strengthening the lungs.\u201d Rather, he said, the goal of exercise is simply to \u201ctire the body\u201d so we can later enjoy a heavy sleep.\nThe ancients didn\u2019t need the research, but it is nice knowing what we now know. Matthew Walker writes of the \u201cclear bidirectional relationship\u201d between exercise and sleep. Physical activity leads to better sleep which boosts physical activity which leads to better sleep which, so on and so on. \u201cIt is clear,\u201d Walker writes in Why We Sleep, \u201cthat a sedentary life is one that does not help with sound sleep, and all of us should try to engage in some degree of regular exercise to help maintain not only the fitness of our bodies but also the quantity and quality of our sleep.\u201d Make it a rule, as I have: strenuous exercise every single day.\nGo The F*ck To Sleep\nYou think you\u2019re not an early morning person\u2026but that\u2019s mostly because you\u2019re not going to bed early enough. You\u2019re staying up to what? Scrolling through TikTok or tweets at 11pm? You should be asleep!\nWhen you\u2019re burned out, when you\u2019re exhausted, when you\u2019ve had that long day where all you want to do is veg out on the couch? That\u2019s precisely when you need the extra discipline to get up and go to bed. Follow the advice of a book I love to read to my kids: Go the F*ck to Sleep!\nMorning routines are great but a bedtime routine is important too. Being disciplined about wrapping up and winding down is essential.\nRead Before Bed\nThe great William Osler (founder of John Hopkins University and a fan of the Stoics) told his medical students it was important that they turn to literature as a way to nourish and relax their minds. \u201cWhen chemistry distresses your soul,\u201d he said, \u201cseek peace in the great pacifier, Shakespeare, ten minutes with Montaigne will lighten the burden.\u201d He told his students to read to relax and to be at leisure. To keep their minds strong and clear.\nInstead of turning to the TV or to Twitter, let us follow Osler\u2019s advice:\nStart at once a bedside library and spend the last half-hour of the day in communion with the saints of humanity. There are great lessons to be learned from Job and from David, from Isaiah and St. Paul. Taught by Shakespeare you may take your intellectual and moral measure with singular precision. Learn to love Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius. Should you be so fortunate as to be born a Platonist, Jowett will introduce you to the great master through whom alone we can think in certain levels, and whose perpetual modernness startles and delights. Montaigne will teach you moderation in all things, and to be \u2018sealed of his tribe\u2019 is a special privilege.\nJournal Before Bed\n\u201cIs there anything finer than this practice of examining one\u2019s entire day?\u201d Seneca asked. \u201cThink of the sleep that follows this self-inspection,\u201d he said, \u201chow peaceful, deep, and free, when the mind has been either praised or admonished, when the sentinel and secret censor of the self has conducted its inquiry into one\u2019s character.\u201d\nThat\u2019s what a great night\u2019s sleep requires. A mental state free of clutter and chaos. It is a state that is never not hard to achieve, because each day presents plenty of opportunities to clutter or minds \u2014 responsibilities, the dysfunctional job that stresses you out, a contentious relationship, reality not agreeing with your expectations. But journaling is a tool uniquely suited to help us declutter our minds. A couple thousand years after Seneca intuited it, the Journal of Experimental Psychology proved that journaling before bed decreases cognitive stimulus, rumination, and worry, allowing you to fall asleep faster. So tonight, try Epictetus\u2019s nightly ritual and see what it can do for you:\nAllow not sleep to close your wearied eyes, Until you have reckoned up each daytime deed: \u2018Where did I go wrong? What did I do? And what duty\u2019s left undone?\u2019 From first to last review your acts and then Reprove yourself for wretched [or cowardly] acts, but rejoice in those done well.\nTreat the weekends the same\nIt almost doesn\u2019t matter what the problem is, the solution is often a consistent routine. Tell a sleep expert you\u2019re not sleeping well, that\u2019s what they\u2019ll suggest. Tell a psychiatrist you\u2019ve been feeling anxious, that\u2019s what their first question will be. Tell a productivity guru your work output isn\u2019t where you want it, that\u2019s where they\u2019ll start. Tell a dog trainer your dog is acting up, that\u2019s where they\u2019ll start. Tell a strength trainer you want to get stronger, tell an author you want to get better at writing, tell the Stoics you want to round out the day in a calmer, more tranquil state \u2014 a consistent routine will be the answer.\nRegardless of the practices you implement from above, the best thing you can do for your sleep is be consistent, seven days a week. \u201cThere is much we can do to secure a far better night of sleep using what we call good \u2018sleep hygiene\u2019 practices,\u201d Matthew Walker writes in Why We Sleep, \u201cbut if you can only adhere to one of these each and every day, make it: going to bed and waking up at the same time of day no matter what. It is perhaps the single most effective way of helping improve your sleep.\u201d\nSleep is an act of character\nI mentioned it above \u2014 in the armed forces, they refer to the idea of sleep discipline. In the Persian Gulf in the 1990s, future Admiral James Stavridis had just been given command of a ship for the first time. This occurred at exactly the same time, he noticed, at age 38, that his natural metabolism and his infinitely youthful ability to just gut it out, had begun to decline. You don\u2019t have to be the most self-aware person on the planet to see that you make worse decisions when you\u2019re tired, that you\u2019re less able to work well with others, that you have less command of yourself and your emotions. But it was still a considerable innovation for Stavridis to decide to treat sleep as an equally important part of a functioning warship as its weapons systems.\nIn response, Stavridis began to monitor the sleep cycles of his crew, moderate their watch duties and encourage naps wherever possible. \u201cWatching our physical health,\u201d he would write later, specifically referring to sleep, \u201cis an act of character and can enormously help with our ability to perform.\u201d\nDiscover the life-giving powers of the nap\nAnders Ericsson, of the classic ten-thousand-hours study, found that master violinists slept eight and a half hours a night on average and took a nap most days. A friend said of Churchill, \u201cHe made in Cuba one discovery which was to prove far more important to his future life than any gain in military experience, the life-giving powers of the siesta.\u201d Naps are restorative, especially as you get older. After a triple-double performance by LeBron James on a Sunday following back-to-back road games in the Midwest and a stop in Phoenix to watch his son play, LeBron was asked if there\u2019s any secret to all the energy he\u2019s been playing with. \u201cSleep,\u201d LeBron said. \u201cI slept last night from 12 to 8. I got up, ate breakfast, and then I went back to sleep from 8:30 to 12:30.\u201d Teammates joke that Lebron is always either sleeping or playing basketball.\nI try to tell this to my kids, who hate napping \u2014 one day you will miss this. Trust me.\nDon\u2019t Sleep When You\u2019re Dead (Sleep Or You\u2019ll Die)\nThe thing I take from Arianna Huffington\u2019s story is to remember that cutting back on sleep not only decreases your quality of life\u2026but it can take your life. People get depressed without sleep. They burn out. They crash their cars. They faint in the bathroom and hit their heads. The philosopher and writer Arthur Schopenhauer used to say that \u201csleep is the source of all health and energy.\u201d He said it better still on a separate occasion: \u201cSleep is the interest we have to pay on the capital which is called in at death. The higher the interest rate and the more regularly it is paid, the further the date of redemption is postponed.\u201d\nIf you want to have a good and long life, sleep now, not later.\nInvest in your sleep\nWhen I dropped out of college and moved to LA, I didn\u2019t have enough money to buy a bed. I borrowed an IKEA futon and slept on the floor for almost two months. When I made a little bit of money, I bought the cheapest mattress from the cheapest mattress store and slept on it for almost a decade. I don\u2019t remember when exactly I decided to upgrade but it was long after I could afford otherwise. The point is: If sleep has all these benefits, if it is literally life-saving, then it makes sense to invest in it. Maybe that\u2019s buying a better mattress. Maybe that\u2019s biting the bullet and paying for a layback seat on an international flight. Maybe that\u2019s a sound machine or blackout shades. Figure out what gets you better sleep and consider it a hell of a deal.\n(One part of my sleep routine is the Eight Sleep\u2019s Pod Pro Cover.

Running a small business is always difficult, running a small business during a pandemic is damn near impossible but a small town book store in rural Texas?\nBut here we are, a year later, not just still standing but doing great!\nWe\u2019ve learned a lot\u2026about business, about books, and about ourselves.\nI made a YouTube video about the experience, but I wanted to expand it here into a fuller explanation of all the lessons that The Painted Porch has taught me. I share them here so you can get something too \u2014 and perhaps learn a little from my experiences and hopefully go create something cool of your own out of it. Here are 29 lessons from the first 12 months of owning The Painted Porch.\n\u2013 It always takes longer than you think it\u2019s going to take. That\u2019s Hofstadter\u2019s law. From the moment my wife suggested we open a small-town bookstore, everything has taken longer and been harder than we expected. If you can\u2019t pass the marshmallow test of delaying gratification and deferring things into the future, you\u2019re just going to get crushed.\n\u2013 For most of my life as an author and entre\u00adpreneur, my work has been digital. Close to half of the sales of my books are audiobooks and ebooks. Every morning, I send out the Daily Stoic and Daily Dad emails to over 500,000 people. I put out a podcast that\u2019s had 80 million downloads. As satisfying as it is to reach large numbers of people through the enormous scale of the internet, there is even more satisfaction in doing something in real life, for real people, even at a much much smaller level. Every time I walk by or to the bookstore, I think, Wow, I made that.\n\u2013 I think one of the best decisions we made was making our book tower. It\u2019s 20 feet tall and made of some 2000 books, 4000 nails, and 40 gallons of glue. It was not cheap to do. It was not easy to do. It took forever. We had to solve all sorts of logistical problems to make it work. But it\u2019s also probably one of the single best marketing and business decisions we made in the whole store. Because it\u2019s the number one thing that people come into the store to take pictures of.\n\u2013 You want to have a unique proposition. You want to have something that only you could do. Most bookstores have thousands and thousands of books. But what we decided here was that we\u2019d have only a couple hundred books, only my absolute favorite books, only the books I put in my Reading List Email. It would only be those books. So not only did this make it cheaper and easier to run the bookstore, it makes us stand out.\n\u2013 There\u2019s this great story of when Jeff Bezos had the idea for Amazon. He was working on Wall Street at the time. He and his boss go for a walk in Central Park and after he tells him his idea, his boss says, \u201cthat sounds like a great idea for someone who doesn\u2019t have a job.\u201d Meaning that somebody else should do it, not Bezos. If there\u2019s something crazy that you\u2019re thinking about doing, maybe you should get serious about actually doing it. On the other side of the risk and the crazy leap can be something that changes your life, that changes your community, that changes the world.\n\u2013 Doing something cool means risk\u2026but just because you take a big risk doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t lots of little ways to take risk off the table. My office is above the bookstore. I rent part of the building out to another business, etc.\n\u2013 There are lots of easier ways to make money than a physical bookstore in 2022\u2026so everyday I try to remind myself this project was not about making lots of money.Remembering why you did something and how you measure success helps you calibrate your decisions properly. I\u2019m happy enough to be putting books out in the world, making this community better, having a physical space, challenging myself, etc\u2026as long as I don\u2019t lose lots of money, that\u2019s a win.\n\u2013 Start small. The problem is when you have really high standards, when you expect a lot of yourself, it\u2019s hard to be comfortable with something that\u2019s kind of crappy or mediocre or not all the way there. But there\u2019s a reason most tech start ups think in terms of a minimum viable product.\n\u2013 Related to that there\u2019s a great Hemingway line \u2014 we actually have a shirt with it, and I have a print of it on my wall \u2014 it\u2019s one of my all-time favorite quotes: the first draft of everything is shit. I love how The Painted Porch is now, but it took weeks and months to get it to where it is. It\u2019s been a continual process of improvement and growth and making changes.\n\u2013 Lengthen your timeline. I mentioned Hofsteader\u2019s Law above \u2014 it was important to remind ourselves many times that the building we were in was nearly 150 years old. It can be very easy on a project to get caught up in the immediacy of what\u2019s in front of you\u2026but you miss the big picture and you miss the reality that most things that work are set up to work for a long time. We sell books in our store that were written 2,500 years ago! Who cares if the project took 13 months longer to open than we thought?\n\u2013 As Zeno said, books are a way to have conversations with the dead. You can learn from people who came before you. They can also inspire and reassure you. Some books I leaned on often throughout this were The War of Art by Steven Pressfield, Meditations by Marcus Aurelius, and A Calendar of Wisdom by Leo Tolstoy.\n\u2013 One of the things I did while I was kicking around the idea is I looked up how expensive it is to start a bookstore. Search results said it was hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars \u2014 way more expensive than I was interested in. But then I wanted to question whether that number was real. So then I went and looked up how expensive it was to start an ecommerce business \u2014 something like Daily Stoic. Search results said it was hundreds of thousands of dollars more than I\u2019d spent to start Daily Stoic. That was really helpful \u2014 to learn, oh, these people don\u2019t really know what they\u2019re talking about. Or that there\u2019s a cheaper way, a different way to do it. You don\u2019t have to do it the way that everyone else does it.\n\u2013 Steal like an artist (also a great book we carry). We got the idea for the bookshelves in our store at someone\u2019s house for a toddler\u2019s birthday party. They had built them themselves, we took a picture and had our contractor do his own version. The book tower was roughly inspired by The Last Bookstore. Even the idea to carry fewer titles and put them face out was partly inspired by Amazon\u2019s physical bookstores. Take from many influences and make them your own.\n\u2013 One of my favorite parts of the whole experience has been watching my wife work her magic. Not only was the original idea to do the store hers, but almost all the big design ideas were hers too. We have very different styles of working but collaborating on this challenged me to see the wisdom in her approach on a humblingly regular basis.\n\u2013 When you get criticism, when you get information, when you get facts \u2014 and of course you have to look for those things \u2014 you have to take them with a grain of salt. You have to put them up to the test, as the Stoics say. You have to question some of the assumptions out there. You might just find, as we did, that instead of something being way too expensive, it is actually doable for you to do it.\n\u2013 Think of it as an experiment. When I was thinking about opening The Painted Porch, I asked Tim Ferriss for advice. \u201cThink about it as an experiment,\u201d he said. \u201cHow are you going to know if it\u2019s something you want to do if you haven\u2019t tried doing it?\u201d The decision to see it as an experiment, not as a permanent life choice, was so freeing. It allowed me to go into it knowing that I was going to commit to it for the next two years, and then, I can reassess, I can change my mind.\n\u2013 Confidence is earned. People talk about trusting their gut. But that\u2019s something you have to earn. I talk about this in Ego is the Enemy \u2014 there\u2019s a difference between confidence and ego. Ego thinks, whatever I want to do, of course I\u2019m going to be successful. Confidence is something you earn, something you earn over time. It\u2019s something you earn through having an idea and bringing it into reality. It\u2019s learning what you\u2019re capable of, learning what\u2019s possible, learning why you do deserve to trust yourself. Confidence is on the other side of having done a scary thing, a thing that a lot of people said wasn\u2019t a good idea.\n\u2013 In Letters From A Stoic, Seneca says he pitied the person who\u2019s never gone through adversity, who\u2019s never done anything difficult. Because they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re capable of. Well\u2026cue March 2020.\n\u2013 Help yourself by helping others. When I first started my Reading List Email in 2008, the idea was that I wanted to celebrate other people\u2019s works. To me, the bookstore is an extension of the idea of celebrating other people\u2019s work. And when you do that, when you create value for people, when you\u2019re generally a positive force in your industry, in your space, you develop a reputation. People want to support you. People want to help you.\n\u2013 Robert Greene\u2019s metaphor for mastery (if you haven\u2019t read Mastery, you must) is being on the inside of something. When we start a new sport, when we get a new job, when we approach a field we haven\u2019t yet studied, we are on the outside of. But as we put in the work, as we familiarize ourselves with every component, as we develop our intuitive field, we eventually make our way to this inside. This is a metaphor I think about constantly with the bookstore.\n\u2013 Permission assets are everything. All my success as a writer, right down to this bookstore, has been rooted in the email lists and social media accounts I have built. When you have direct access to people who like what you do, everything is more affordable and more scalable. When you don\u2019t? Everything is harder and requires so much more luck.\n\u2013 Just do the right thing\u2026the rest doesn\u2019t matter. That\u2019s what Marcus Aurelius writes in Meditations. We delayed opening during the worst days of COVID \u2014 we didn\u2019t need to, so why contribute to the problem? We paid people to work remotely instead. We kept up safety protocols even after the state of Texas washed its hands of its responsibilities last year. We did it even though people got mad at us for it, even though it probably cost us business. My conscience is clean and that\u2019s what counts. Keeping your community and your staff safe is good for business in the long run anyway.\n\u2013 If it makes you a worse person (parent, neighbor, writer, whatever), it\u2019s not success. On a note to myself when we were opening the bookstore in the middle of the pandemic, I wrote, \u201c2020 is a test: will it make you a better person or a worse person?\u201d That was the test that I reminded myself of over and over again: will this make you a better person or a worse person? If starting a business makes you a worse person \u2014 if it stresses you out, if it tears your relationships apart, if it makes you bitter or frustrated with people \u2014 then it doesn\u2019t matter how much money it makes or external praise it receives. It\u2019s not successful.\n\u2013 As we were going through it, my wife and I asked ourselves, what does success look like? And we decided that success was going to be: becoming more community minded, becoming more responsible, becoming better organized, having more fun, making a positive contribution.\n\u2013 Physical experiences matter more in a digital world. If people wanted a book cheaply, they\u2019d buy it online. There has to be a reason people would drive out and come to your business. We made a lot of our design and marketing decisions around that idea.\n\u2013 It would be wonderful of course if marketing didn\u2019t have to exist. If things could be bare-boned. If presentation and packaging didn\u2019t matter. That\u2019s just not how life works \u2014 never has and it never will. You have to do interesting stuff. You have to make remarkable things, as Seth Godin writes in Purple Cow, you have to do remarkable marketing. Do stuff that commands attention. Draw attention like a magnet. These things cannot be underestimated.\n\u2013 COVID has been tough. Even as I was working on this piece, we had to close because people got sick, even after all our precautions and we couldn\u2019t stay open. That was expensive and it was scary for everyone. But we took it one day at a time, we adapted, we adjusted, we figured it out. Which is all you can do. .\n\u2013 In The Obstacle is the Way, I quote this Haitian proverb that I like: behind mountains are more mountains. That\u2019s just how life is. You don\u2019t overcome one obstacle, you don\u2019t get through the first year of your business, and then suddenly, you\u2019re magically done with obstacles. No, that\u2019s not how life works. Life is one obstacle after another. You just have to keep going.\n\u2013 I mentioned Austin Kleon\u2019s book Steal Like An Artist earlier but his book Keep Going was even more relevant to this journey.\nI happened to be writing Courage is Calling during most of the crazy period of putting this book store together. Obviously, starting a small business is not the same as running into a burning building or onto a battlefield, but one thing you can\u2019t escape noticing when you read history or biography is just how badly we need people to step up, to put themselves out there, to pursue their crazy ideas. All of human progress \u2014 big and small \u2014 depends on that.\nIf you\u2019re thinking of doing something, if you feel called to do something\u2026well, maybe you should do it. Just remember to\u2026\nStart small.\nBe patient.\nThink of it as an experiment.\nDo it the way only you could do it.\nFind ways to take risk off the table.\nDefine what success means to you.\nQuestion some of the assumptions out there.\nSee adversity as an opportunity to find out what you are capable of.\nKeep going \u2014 behind mountains are more mountains.\nAnyway, come visit us on Main St. in Bastrop sometime\u2026or support the store online at thepaintedporch.com!

What we choose to say. What we choose to think.\nWe choose what kind of person we are going to be.\nIt all comes down to choices.\nAnd Stoicism, it could be said, is a philosophy about how to make better choices. This is what we see in a book like Meditations. We see Marcus Aurelius journaling, working to get better at choosing. Choosing the right things to value, the right things to think, the right things to focus on, the right response to a difficult situation.\nIn this article, I am going to give you the best insights from the Stoics on choosing well to live better.\nStart now by making the choice to\u2026\nSay Yes Only To What Matters\nBeing great at anything requires concentration. It requires elimination, Seneca says. \u201cHe who is everywhere is nowhere.\u201d\nIf you want to be great at whatever it is you\u2019re doing, you have to make some choices about what you say yes to and what you say no to. Everything you say yes to means saying no to something else. And conversely, everything you say no to means saying yes to something else.\nWhen you say no, when you cut out the inessential, the Stoics say, it allows you to double down on what is truly essential. So the question is: are you saying no to say yes only to what matters?\nControl Your Emotions\nCato was once spat on by a rival politician. He was a physically tough man, a soldier, who could have, let\u2019s say, taken matters into his own hands. Instead, he is reported to have laughed and said, \u201cI will swear to anyone, Lentulus, that people are wrong to say that you cannot use your mouth.\u201d\nIn another case, he was punched and responded to the man\u2019s apology by saying, \u201cI don\u2019t even remember being hit.\u201d\nCato chose not to be provoked. He chose not to be dragged down to their level. He didn\u2019t lose his temper. He didn\u2019t let them get to him. He abided by Marcus Aurelius\u2019s wisdom, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to turn this into something. It doesn\u2019t have to upset you.\u201d\nLet Go of Anxiety\nThis was a breakthrough I had during the pandemic. Suddenly, I had a lot less to worry about. I wasn\u2019t doing the things that, in the past, I told myself were the causes of my anxiety. I wasn\u2019t having to get to this plane. I wasn\u2019t battling traffic to get somewhere on time. I wasn\u2019t having to prepare for this talk or that one.\nSo you\u2019d think that my anxiety would have gone way down. But it didn\u2019t. And what I realized is that anxiety has nothing to do with any of these things.\nMarcus Aurelius actually talks about this in Meditations. \u201cToday I escaped from anxiety,\u201d he says. \u201cOr no, I discarded it, because it was within me, in my own perceptions \u2014 not outside.\u201d He writes this during a plague, no less.\nWe tell ourselves we are stressed and anxious and worried because of the pressure our boss puts on us or because of some looming deadline or because of all of the places we have to be and people we have to see. And then when all that gets paired down, you realize, \u2018Oh, no, it was me. I\u2019m the common variable.\u2019 The anxiety is coming from the inside. And you can choose to discard it.\nStop Wasting Time\nWhen I was 20 years old, I was thinking about becoming a writer. I had about a year left on my contract at the company I was working at. I was telling Robert Greene, one of the greatest writers of all time, about all of this, and he told me I had two options. With this next year, he said, you have the choice between alive time and dead time.\nDead time is when you waste time sitting around, waiting, hoping for things to happen to you.\nAlive time is when you are in control, when you make every second count, when you are learning and improving and growing and experimenting.\nIs this going to be Alive Time or Dead Time? I decided to print it out and put it on my wall. And it was one of the most productive years of my life. I read stacks and stacks of books. I filled up a box of notecards. I reached out to people and have relationships to this day that came out of that experience.\nMost of all, what I took was life is constantly asking us, Is this going to be alive time or dead time? A long commute \u2014 are you going to zone out or listen to an audiobook? A delayed flight \u2014 are you going to get a couple thousands steps around the terminal or shove a Cinnabon into our face? A contract we have to earn out \u2014 is this tying us down or freeing us up?\nWhat you do with the time when you are not totally in control \u2014 that is the critical choice you have to constantly make.\nFocus On What\u2019s In Your Control\n99 percent of the things that you spend time on don\u2019t matter. It\u2019s not that they\u2019re not important. It\u2019s that we focus on things that are not up to us.\nEpictetus said, \u201cThe chief task in life is simply this: to identify and separate matters so that I can say clearly to myself which are externals not under my control, and which have to do with the choices I actually control\u2026\u201d\nThe chief choice is between things that are in our control and those that are not in our control. What other people do, what other people say, what the weather is doing, how the dice rolls \u2014 just about everything except our actions, our thoughts, our feelings \u2014 not in our control.\nOur actions, our thoughts, our feelings \u2014 these are up to us. Other people, the weather, external events, these are not. But here\u2019s the thing: our responses to other people, the weather, external events are in our control.\nMaking this distinction and then choosing to focus on the things that are in your control will make you happier, stronger, and more successful. If only because it concentrates your resources in the places where they matter.\nDo The More Difficult Thing\nWhenever we come to a little crossroad \u2014 a decision about how to do things and what things to do \u2014 the Stoics said to default to the option that challenges you the most.\nMarcus Aurelius wrote in Meditations about holding the reins in his non-dominant hand as both an exercise to practice and a metaphor for doing the difficult thing. Seneca talked about how a person who skates through life without being tested and challenged is actually depriving themselves of opportunities to grow and improve.\nIt is both these ideas that informed one of the things I wanted to do with my book Courage is Calling. I wanted to alter people\u2019s perception of courage. To get people to stop thinking our courage only as what happens on the battlefield or when destiny calls you onto the world\u2019s stage. Courage is a kind of craft, something you pursue day in and day out just as one pursues the mastery of any profession or skill. It\u2019s something you do, something you make a habit of.\nJump into the colder pool. Walk instead of drive. Pick up the book instead of your phone. Take responsibility instead of hoping it goes unnoticed. It matters big and small, courage is choosing the more difficult option. Make it a habit. Iron sharpens iron, after all. You\u2019ll be better for it \u2014 not only for the improvement that comes from the challenge itself, but for the willpower you are developing by choosing that option on purpose.\nWhen you have two choices, choose the more difficult one. Choose the one, as Marcus would agree, that allows you to take the reins in any situation.\nGrab The Smooth Handle\nIf you\u2019ve ever been stuck in Los Angeles traffic at night, you know it\u2019s miserable. But if you\u2019ve ever seen a helicopter shot of Los Angeles at night, you\u2019ve seen how this same miserable experience can suddenly be made to seem beautiful and serene. We call one a traffic jam, the other a light show.\nSame thing, different perspective.\nLife is like this. We can look at it one way and be scared or angry or worried. We can look at it another and find an exciting challenge. We can choose to look at something as an obstacle or an opportunity. We can see chaos if we look up close, or order if we look from afar.\nAs Epictetus said, each situation has two handles \u2014 one that will bear weight and one that won\u2019t. We get to choose how we look at things. We get to look for the best handle to grab. As Marcus would put it, we get to choose the thoughts we dye the world with.\nLittle Choices Make For a Big Change\nThese choices are all very minor, I get that. But that\u2019s the point. These little choices we make\u2013the choice to direct our attention, to grab the right handle, to not get upset\u2013this adds up.\nTo what?\nTo freedom, the Stoics would say.

Stop quoting two lines from a 3,400-yr old passage in a book that condones slavery and polygamy and war, but not homosexuality (a book that forbids dozens of things straight people do, btw, but you comfortably ignore the cognitive dissonance.) Love is not a sin. Human connection is the most important human need, and you don\u2019t get to decide who gets to experience it. Tolerance is \u201cthey can do what they like in their bedrooms, but why are they flaunting it?\u201d \u2014 said by the Christian man who has pictures of his wedding on his desk, who kisses his wife in public, who shows me photos of his honeymoon. Flaunting it. Outside the bedroom.\nFuck tolerance.\nTolerance debates how many days Latinx children can be kept in cages, away from their mothers. Tolerance allows them in, to work them in farms at illegally-low wages.

The member of a typically marginalized class who finds a way to sidle up to privilege by selling out their own people.\nMany trans folk experience levels of discrimination from a young age, even prior to coming out.

Being thrown out of the house in their teens for being a \u201csissy.\u201d Discrimination in jobs & housing for being \u201cswishy.\u201d Still, many trans women experience such gender dysphoria that they have to transition early in life, in spite of great danger.\nTransgender student, boyfriend attacked outside Barrington High School; believe incident was a hate\u2026\nCBS Chicago BARRINGTON, Ill. (CBS) -- The Orbeez TikTok Challenge is taking place at schools across the country - it\u2026www.cbsnews.com\nDecades ago, transitioning early was pretty much impossible. Even if the parents are supportive, school environments tend to be deeply hostile towards trans students \u2014 from school staff misgendering students and showing open hostility, to the never-ending bathroom controversy, to such a constant level of bullying from many directions, that many trans kids decline into depression, suicidal thought or self-harm.\nTrans women who transition late give up a lot \u2014 they lose a chance of experiencing youth as a woman, to experience parenthood as a mother, to have strong female friendships. The reason for the wait might be a transphobic environment, fear of losing one\u2019s privileges, or a combination of both.\nFor Jenner, as is with some trans folk who grow up hiding in privilege (wealth, status, etc.) in transphobic homes, transphobic institutions, politely nodding and smiling at vicious jokes and stereotypes about trans women, there\u2019s little reason to grow a sense of mutual plight, of community, toward the trans community.\nFor Jenner in particular, there\u2019s never been much reason to come slumming. To participate in community organizing, to discuss the wellbeing of teenage trans runaways, to plan for safe trans housing, to advocate for jobs for trans people. She\u2019s \u201cnot one of those trans women.\u201d She\u2019s \u201cone of the good ones.\u201d\nUltimately, people have to choose their allegiances. People have to choose which identity to sacrifice in order to highlight an identity they cling to. Power, wealth, fame are incredibly attractive. And obviously, this is Jenner\u2019s crowd \u2014 the wealthy, the powerful, the famous. She \u201chappens to be\u201d transgender, in the same way that Ben Carson \u201chappens to be\u201d Black.\nMs. Jenner is a woman \u2014 but she\u2019s a rich, White, Anglo-Saxon Republican first and foremost.\nSometimes there\u2019s an even worse dynamic at play. I\u2019d compare it to Stockholm Syndrome. One internalizes the narrative of the oppressor.\nMarjorie Taylor Greene recently defined \u2018woman\u2019: The weaker sex, from Adam\u2019s rib, created by God to be Adam\u2019s wife. Taylor Greene throws away all women\u2019s rights, and Jenner throws away trans women\u2019s rights specifically.\nDefine \u2018Woman\u2019\nThe new \u2018gotcha\u2019 phrase by transphobes \u2014 and a full answergen.medium.com\nIt\u2019s profoundly sad when a member of the marginalized becomes a lackey, a tool for the oppressor. For the oppressor, it\u2019s a wonderful opportunity to use the lackey to legitimize the oppression.\n\u201cMind your place,\u201d \n\u201cKeep your head down,\u201d \n\u201cWe mustn\u2019t displease the master.\u201d\nSo what\u2019s wrong with the \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay\u201d Bill?\nAny political Bills use language deliberately meant to hide the real purpose of the Bill behind some \u201cpatriotic\u201d reason, or \u201cthink of the children,\u201d or some other seemingly benign story.\nThe way we moved the needle on Black Civil rights was by teaching the children, who grew up to be less prejudiced than their parents. Now many states are banning any teaching of the civil rights movement, or allowing the parents to opt their kids out if it makes them uncomfortable. We\u2019ll get a generation of racist children.\nThere are many things kids need to be taught. Boys absolutely need to be taught not to be misogynists. Things like \u201cgirl cooties,\u201d and \u201coh Sally, he picks on you bc he likes you,\u201d and boys refusing to read books about girls, these need to stop.\nClasses about menstruation need to happen BEFORE cis girls (and trans boys, and nonbinary kids) start bleeding. And boys should most definitely stay in the room. They\u2019ll learn to be empathetic and kinder to those menstruating. And girls (and trans boys, and nonbinary kids) will feel less body shame.\nAnd all children need to learn there are nonbinary kids, gay kids, and trans kids in the world. When kids grow up without any notion that such people exist, two things happen: straight & cis kids react to queer kids with confusion and disgust, and bully them (often to the point of suicide). And queer kids grow up with self-loathing, feeling they\u2019re freaks, defects instead just simply a type of human that exists.\nTransgender student bullied in bathroom may be punished before boys who harassed him\nMURFREESBORO, Tenn. (WTVF) - A Murfreesboro mother is upset her transgender son could be punished after boys apparently\u2026www.newschannel5.com\n\nThe \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay\u201d Bill prohibits the teacher from explaining why Billy has two dads, and why it\u2019s ok for some families to be different.\nIf the teacher is married to someone of the same sex, the \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay\u201d Bill forbids any mention of their spouse, or even that they\u2019re married.\nThe \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay\u201d Bill prohibits the teacher from properly explaining to the class why they shouldn\u2019t bully the trans child \u2014 the teacher can\u2019t explain anything about the trans experience to the class (this makes the class environment impossibly dangerous for trans kids, essentially forcing them to homeschool).\n\nWhat DiSantis considers \u201cnot appropriate\u201d is just acknowledging LGBTQIA people even exist. It\u2019s not like any teacher has been sharing graphic details about blowjobs. DiSantis just wants to quelch any talk that normalizes queer people.\nRecently a teacher was disciplined and bullied into resigning simply for writing \u201cYou\u2019re free to be yourself with me. You matter\u201d using rainbow colors, on the whiteboard.\nThe message teacher Tyler Clay Morgan wrote on his classroom board \u2014 a message that created such a hostile environment he was forced to resign.\nThis Bill will produce a generation of homophobes. It\u2019ll 100% increase school bullying. It will cause an increase in suicides among queer kids.\nKids Know Their Gender \u2014 And Often Their Sexuality Too\nMany kids are aware of their gender at an early age. Before first grade. In some cases, as young as three or four years of age. They pout or throw tantrums when cakes the wrong pronouns. They demand or beg for clothes that match their gender.\nWhen I asked a group of lesbians \u201cwhen did you know you were a lesbian?\u201d the answers varied between \u201cin college,\u201d \u201cafter I was married,\u201d \u201cwhen I hit puberty,\u201d and \u201cI can\u2019t think of a time I didn\u2019t know. I always knew.\u201d\nWhen I asked a group of trans women \u201cwhen did you know you were trans?\u201d most of them spoke about knowing from the age of three or four \u2014 but keeping it hidden for years. (That\u2019s why there are so many trans kids coming out now, they\u2019re less afraid.)\nLastly, this Bill does NOT restrict itself to third grade. It says third grade OR in a manner that is not age-appropriate. So if a transphobic principal considers ANY talk of trans people \u201cinappropriate\u201d for 17-yr-old Seniors, the teacher can be disciplined for mentioning it.\nThis Bill is poison.", "comment_count": 4, "like_count": 787, "created_time": 1649621352606, "comment": [{"user_id": "7befda74db4e", "comment_time": 1649621352606, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "4fdc4c3178fa", "comment_time": 1649643414400, "comment": "He is not a Woman .

She was asked to define \u201cWoman.\u201d It was a clearly rehearsed, strategic question to elicit a bad outcome for the Judge. It was meant to hit the media as a sound clip: These crazy libtards can\u2019t even define \u201cwoman.\u201d Predictably, Tucker Carlson did a whole number with this.\nHere\u2019s the clip:\n\nI think the strategy worked. The way Marsha Blackburn framed it was insidiously clever. While the Judge responded with a reasoned, accurate answer, this moment delivered the ingredients which people like Tucker Carlson could then cook up into the following premise: \n\u201cThe Right asks a basic, simple question \u2014 \u2018what is a woman.\u2019 The Left can\u2019t even provide a simple answer.\u201d\nIt works. \nAnd also, it\u2019s a fallacy.\nFallacies are disingenuous arguments meant to bias a debate. The question is a \u201cgotcha\u201d question \u2014 it creates a framework that predisposes a good outcome for your side, and puts the opposing side in a position where ANY answer from the opposing side leads to a bad outcome for them.\nLoaded questions are often inflammatory in nature, making them an effective way to derail an otherwise rational debate, as the recipient may be quick to become defensive.\nThe Judge did right in providing a rational response. However, this is what I would\u2019ve said \u2014 have said \u2014 in answer to this question.\nDefinitions evolve over time, context and purpose\nDefinitions evolve over time. \u201cCar\u201d used to mean a wooden carriage pulled by a horse. Nowadays it means a metal machine pulled by its own engine. Language evolves. Also, words can have several definitions depending on context, circumstance, and intended purpose.\nIf you ask for a current definition, in some contexts it just means \u201cvehicle\u201d (your ride, your wheels). In some other contexts \u201ccar\u201d means a specific set or type of street-legal vehicle (sedan, convertible, coupe, sports car) \u2014 excluding other types. Wikipedia says an SUV is a car \u2014 Cars.com says it\u2019s not.\nFurthermore, everyone refers to toy cars as \u201ccars\u201d \u2014 even though they\u2019re definitely not street-legal, and cannot carry passengers. And though golf carts are not considered cars \u2014 because they\u2019re not street-legal, Formula One cars ARE cars \u2014 even though they\u2019re not street-legal either.\nWhat is a woman?\nThe word has a long history and the definitions change over time. Originally, it simply meant \u201cthe one who grinds the grain.\u201d (\u201cwiif\u201d evolved to wife, and melted into \u201cwo-\u201d) But surely that meaning is outdated. Most of my friends haven\u2019t ground any grain in some time.\nHistorical/Traditional Definitions\n(European, Middle-Eastern, and most Asian traditions)\nAnother longstanding historical definition was \u201cthe one with the womb.\u201d But not just that \u2014 it also meant \u201cthe one who\u2019s destined to be subjugated to a man. First the father, then the husband. The one who doesn\u2019t get to decide things. The one who is considered chattel property. The one whom the husband gets to fuck whenever he so desires, even if she really, really doesn\u2019t want to. The one who cannot go to school. The one who must stay in a special tent outside the village when she bleeds. The one who cannot attend school. The one who can be beaten for being a \u2018difficult\u2019 or \u2018disobedient\u2019 wife.\u201d Also see: \u201cthe one who\u2019s barefoot, pregnant, and in the kitchen.\u201d\nConservatives (aka regressives) seem to be fighting hard to bring this version of woman back. (See the draconian laws in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, and Wisconsin.)\n\nSen. Marjorie Taylor Greene recently told the Georgia Republican Assembly, \u201cI\u2019m going to tell you right now what is a woman. We came from Adam\u2019s rib. God created us with his hands. We may be the weaker sex, we are the weaker sex, but we are our partner\u2019s, our husband\u2019s, wife.\u201d\nProgressives, Liberals, Feminists since the 1600s or even earlier have been pushing against these definitions of \u2018woman\u2019 as a caste. Feminists have pushed for changes to the societal definition of \u2018woman\u2019 by campaigning for women\u2019s right to vote, women\u2019s right to drive, women\u2019s right to walk in public unescorted by a man, women\u2019s right to own property, women\u2019s right to make decisions in a great number of social spheres.\nBiological/Anatomical Definitions\nOf course, conservatives will demand the biological definition.\nDefinitions are not absolutes. When defining a type of human or anything else, we need to remember the word \u201cMOST.\u201d\nWords like \u2018usually,\u2019 \u2018generally,\u2019 \u2018frequently,\u2019 \u2018in most cases,\u2019 are vital in definitions. Nuance is vital. \u201cThe sky is blue\u201d is true at a simplistic level \u2014 but it\u2019s also black at night. It may be orange, pink and purple at sunset. It\u2019s gray during Seattle winters. A more accurate statement would be \u201cthe sky is generally blue.\u201d\nBiology is a nuanced and complex science. When speaking about biology, this nuance is essential. Here are some examples:\nMost African people are dark-skinned and brown-eyed... except Africans with albinism. Albino Africans are extremely light-skinned; and due to prejudice and superstition, this often proves deadly. In some regions they might be killed as infants, or shunned, to prevent bad luck. In some other regions, they\u2019re hunted down, their body parts used for magic. Albinism is rare \u2014 1 in every 5,000. However, with Africa\u2019s population at 1,2 billion, there are over 240,000 albino folks in Africa \u2014 and many of them live in fear for their lives, simply because of prejudice and ignorance.\nMost African people are dark-skinned and brown-eyed\u2026 except in Ethiopia. Ethnically, the skin of the Nilotes of South Sudan is very dark \u2014 the darkest in all of Africa. Conversely, people in Ethiopia have the lightest skin in all of Africa. (Well, most people in Ethiopia. Mursi people, also in Ethiopia, tend to have dark skin.)\nMost African people are dark-skinned and brown-eyed\u2026 except when they don\u2019t. Over 400,000 Africans are blue-eyed.\nAssumptions are made about blue-eyed African people. An Igbo couple was shocked recently when they saw their blonde, blue-eyed baby. A Nigerian father left his wife and children because of their blue eyes. Blue-eyed people are often demonized, cast aside, and \u2018othered.\u2019 Considering a history of genocide and massive trauma as a result of white colonizers, African people react with suspicion, thinking there\u2019s been some misdeed \u2014 adultery, sexual pandering to a white man, etc. In reality, the most common reason some African people have blue eyes is a genetic mutation (OCA2) that causes people to have blue eyes. The same mutation that causes blue eyes in Europe, Asia, and other regions. Less frequent in Africa, but just as real.\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s important to say MOST African people have dark eyes. Usually, they do. In most cases. Just not always.\nMOST people in Africa have dark eyes. However, some African people (and some Asian, and some Afghani folks) have blue, or green, eyes.\nWomen and Biology\nSexual dimorphism: The differences in size, form and features between sexes. (Note: In contrast to the dramatic dimorphism in other animal species, humans are very mildly dimorphic \u2014 evidenced almost exclusively in reproductive organs, mammary glands, and minute differences in strength and size.)\nCisgender (cis: near, on this side + gender) \u2014 a person whose sexual dimorphism aligns with their gender.\nTransgender: (trans: across, away from + gender) \u2014 a person whose sexual dimorphism does not align with their gender.\nMost (and the word \u201cmost\u201d is vital here) women have vaginas. 98% or more of all women were born with vaginas. Most cisgender women are born with vaginas, and some trans women are able to receive a vagina through surgery. (Let\u2019s not forget that over 50 million transgender men \u2014 and many of them still have a vagina.)\nSome cisgender women are born without a vagina (MRKH). This syndrome is rare \u2014 only 1 in 4,500 women have this. But that\u2019s nearly A MILLION women (more than the entire population of Alaska).\nSome cis women have TWO vaginas (vaginal septum). Some women are born with TWO uteruses (uterine didelphys). These are two of the seven documented types of M\u00fcllerian duct anomalies (unusual configurations of the sexual organs). Over 100 MILLION women have some type of M\u00fcllerian anomaly.\n\nMost women have vulvas. Some cis women don\u2019t have vulvas because they\u2019ve been castrated (FGM). Some cis women lose part of their vagina or their vulva to cancer. Some trans women do not have vulvas (surgeries can be expensive, or simply inaccessible in many countries). All of these are women.\nMost women have ovaries. In most cases, cis women are born with ovaries. In most cases, trans women are born with testicles, and many remove these through surgery. Some cis women are born with internal testicles. Some cis women are born with one ovary, or none. Some cis women have had them removed through surgery. They\u2019re still women.\nSome women have breasts. Some have large breasts, some have small breasts. Some have hardly any breast tissue at all. They\u2019re still women.\nSome people are Intersex.\nSome intersex people are women. Some are men, and some are non-binary\nIntersex is not a social construct, or an ideology, or even a gender identity. Intersex is an infrequent biological configuration, where a person\u2019s body has both \u2018male\u2019 AND \u2018female\u2019 features, making it difficult to determine their sex based on chromosomes or by examining external or internal sexual organs. Examples medical classifications of intersex types are androgen insensitivity, congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), 5-alpha reductase deficiency, gonadal mosaicism, and Kleinfelters syndrome.\nA note on chromosomes:\nOne of the arguments conservatives like to cling to is that women have XX chromosomes, men have XY chromosomes. Generally, humans have 46 pairs of chromosomes, arranged in 23 pairs. The two chromosomes that govern the configuration of the reproductive system are called allosomes. Most (remember most?) individuals we call female have two X chromosomes, and most individuals we deem male have an X chromosome along with a Y chromosome. However, there are individuals born with only 45 chromosomes (X), with 47 chromosomes (XXY, XYY, XXX) or even with 48 (XXXX, XXXY, XXYY).\nSo, if you\u2019re reading this and you\u2019re cocksure (pardon the pun) that it\u2019s all about the chromosomes, let me ask you this: Do you know what sex chromosomes you have? (This reminds me about racists taking the 23andMe genetic test and finding out they have African or Jewish ancestry. Awkward!)\nIntersex variations are present in many animal species. And to make it even more interesting, birds don\u2019t even have XX / XY chromosomes \u2014 they have ZZ and ZW. And the platypus has 10 sex chromosomes (most male platypodes have XYXYXYXYXY).\n\nPhilosophical/Ideological Definitions\nJudith Butler, Ph.D. claims that gender is performative \u2014 that we establish our gender through our actions and interactions with society. One way to look at this idea is that a farmer is a farmer because she farms. She farms because she is somehow drawn to farming. Therefore she has learned how to farm, and so she farms. She owns a farm because it allows her to farm. Presumably, she enjoys farming to some lesser or greater degree. In the same capacity, a woman \u201cwomans.\u201d (Note: this is my own somewhat whimsical interpretation of Butler\u2019s books, Gender Trouble and Bodies That Matter.)\nFor anyone seeking to dive deeper into this, great places to start are Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw\u2019s TED talks, Julia Serano's Whipping Girl, and the poetry of Audre Lorde, Gloria Anzald\u00faa, and Cherrie Moraga.\nSocietal Definition\nSocietally, the question of what is a woman is under revision. Conservatives want to keep it as it was, historically, in Euro-centric culture \u2014 a person with a womb. And some conservatives really want the FULL old definition \u2014 a servant of men, a submissive assistant who cleans the house, raises the kids, and doesn\u2019t have opinions. This is deeply evident in Texas, with ridiculously draconian laws to remove women\u2019s agency over their lives. Liberals and intersectional feminists prefer a model where people are allowed autonomy over their lives. (It\u2019s so deeply ironic and disingenuous that the Republican party, claiming to be the party of self-subsistence, rugged autonomy and smaller government, now proposes a model where the government is scrutinizing children\u2019s genitals, and policing women\u2019s wombs!)\nProgressives believe what matters is not the parts \u2014 it\u2019s the deep certainty of oneself, the self-knowledge that comes from deep within ourselves. A trans girl may know, to the core of her five-year-old being, that she\u2019s a girl. OR, she may just feel less comfortable with \u201cboy stuff,\u201d and look with longing at the other side of the schoolyard, where the girls are playing. She may not have the language. She may be growing up in such a repressed, transphobic environment (as it was in my case) that she may not even know an option of living as a girl is available to her.\nIdentity isn\u2019t simply a self-contained unit. It is a relationship between people and history, people and communities, people and institutions. \u2014 Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw\nA cisgender woman is a TYPE of woman\nWe\u2019ve lived for centuries in a society that centers some people, and puts other people in the margins. A man is not THE archetypical human being \u2014 a man is one type of human being. He\u2019s a male human being. White people are not archetypical human beings \u2014 they\u2019re one type of people.\nA white woman is a TYPE of woman\nDuring a women\u2019s convention in Akron, Ohio in 1851, a very tall, gaunt, Black former slave got up to talk. This was viewed by many as an invasion, as an outrage. Many asked the event organizers to not allow this Black person to talk. As she took to the podium, Sojourner Truth gave her famous speech, with the repeated refrain \u201cAin\u2019t I a woman?\u201d Her speech was more eloquent than that of any other at that gathering. And yet even recently bell hooks repudiated white feminism for its lack of Black inclusion. The work of bell hooks informed Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw in her own concepts of intersectional feminism \u2014 the notion that some people stand at an intersection of two or more discriminations. A Black woman is a woman, and also Black. She endures misogyny AND racism. A trans woman is a woman, and also Trans. She endures misogyny AND transphobia.\n\nFlorida\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay\u201d Law\nConservatives believe you can turn a straight boy gay, or turn him into a trans girl, by exposing him to books, TV shows, or movies. This is a very uninformed, very misguided notion. We know for a fact that aversion therapy does not work on gay kids. You can\u2019t turn a gay kid straight \u2014 not even with bullying, gaslighting, abuse. Not even with torture. What are the chances, then, of a straight kid reading a book and deciding to switch orientation or gender?\nI grew up in Argentina during a military dictatorship, I was not even a little bit aware of the existence of LGBTQIA people \u2014 with the exception of vulgar, threatening, nasty graffiti in male public bathrooms. Horrible hateful words aimed at \u201cputos\u201d (fags). I grew up knowing that whatever those people are, I certainly do not want to be one of them. At eleven, during a family vacation in Argentina, I saw the cover of a tabloid, highlighting the \u201csex change\u201d of a young trans woman. It stopped me in my tracks. (\u201cYou can do that??\u201d) Still, I didn\u2019t \u201cturn\u201d trans. It took decades, and some life events, before I couldn\u2019t take it anymore, and dove into my transition \u2014 even though I knew I\u2019d be losing so much, enduring so much, putting my life at risk.\nYou can\u2019t \u201ckeep\u201d a trans kid from being trans. What you CAN do is create a closeted, self-hating trans kid, who will go on to be a closeted, self-hating trans adult.\n\u201cFacts over feelings\u201d\nTransgender experience IS a fact \u2014 confirmed by scientists for over a century.\nTransgender Facts \u2014 Mayo Clinic\n\u201cI\u2019m XY and I Know It\u201d: Sex Determination Systems 101 \u2014 Harvard University\nSex isn\u2019t binary, and we should stop acting like it is \u2014 Massive Science\nBetter mental health found among transgender people who started hormones as teens \u2014 Standford University School of Medicine\nWhat does the scholarly research say about the effect of gender transition on transgender well-being? \u2014 Cornell University\nStop Using Phony Science to Justify Transphobia \u2014 Scientific American\nGender Identity is NOT a \u201cfeeling\u201d \u2014 as conservatives like to dismiss it. It\u2019s an internal certainty. Just like being left-handed, or being autistic, or other internal markers of self. I CAN write with my right hand. Awkwardly. Slowly. But it doesn\u2019t feel right. I feel comfortable and natural when I write with my left hand. I don\u2019t \u201cfeel\u201d I\u2019m left-handed, I know it.\nI know I\u2019m not a cisgender woman. I don\u2019t claim to be. I\u2019ve always known, with some degree of grief, that I cannot birth a child. But I know I\u2019m NOT a man. The way I see the world, the people I choose to befriend, the way I want to be seen and treated, the way I experience myself when I\u2019m by myself deep in nature, with no one in sight, are all FEMALE. I experience the world through a female lens.\nAspiring, Becoming, Learning, Being\nA debate exists, even among trans women, about how we talk about our transition. I believe it\u2019s an individual thing, different for each of us. I believe in my case the label of \u2018woman\u2018\u201d\u2019 was first aspirational \u2014 as I started my journey I was a child who yearned to experience life as a woman but didn\u2019t know she could. Raised as a boy, I did not know the full weight of the experiences and struggles of women. Along my journey, I slowly became, blossomed into being visibly a woman. And I learned the hardships, the challenges endured by women. Some of these are specific to cis women \u2014 I don't claim to experience these. But I\u2019ve grown a much deeper empathy for experiences such as endometriosis, PMDD, peri-menopause, etc. through intimate congregational experiences with my cis women friends. And some of these are NOT unique to cis women. Patriarchy, misogyny, objectification, and harassment of women are still very, very much in play in this society \u2014 and I experience these directly these days. I\u2019ve been physically attacked and I\u2019ve been sexually assaulted. I walk home with my keys between my knuckles, and I worry when strange men approach me at night. However, these days I also get to be a mother to my children. I experience the deep bond of female friendships. I get to experience love as a woman. These days I AM a woman.\nLet\u2019s talk about what a woman ISN\u2019T\nA woman is not a sex toy for men. A woman is not a walking womb for men to control. A woman is not the sole worker maintaining the household or the only caregiver for the kids. A woman is not a resource entitled men can gain access to, through charm, coercion, deceit or violence. A woman is not a second-class citizen in a caste system that has men on top.\nShe is the only person who has authority over her womb or her body.\nShe is the only person who has authority over her destiny.\nShe is capable of leadership, wisdom, power.\nA woman is a full human being.\nWestern colonization, patriarchy, and the gender binary\nAll of these conversations above assume the Euro-centric view of gender is universal and represents the \u201cabsolute order of things.\u201d It\u2019s not.\n\nMost indigenous societies across the globe have long recognized that gender is a spectrum, broader than just \u201cboy/girl.\u201d They\u2019ve recognized NUANCE. (There is more than \u201cday/night\u201d \u2014 there is also dusk, dawn, sunset and morning.) The Hawaiians have several genders \u2014 kane, wahine and mahu. The Zapotec people in SouthWest Mexico have hombre, muxe, mujer. In Indonesia, the Bugi people (a highly influential and important ethnic group comprising six million people) firmly hold a framework of five genders: makkunrai, oroan\u00e9, bissu, calabai, and calalai. Native-American nations each had terminology for multiple genders (these days most use the term Two-Spirit for individuals outside the gender binary). India has always had the Hijra. Samoans have Fa\u2019afafine.\nThe gender binary is a Judeo-Christian (and Roman) over-simplified framework that enables MEN to own and control women.\nThe gender binary is a Judeo-Christian (and Roman) over-simplified framework that enables MEN to own and control women.\nThe Gender Binary as a Tool of Oppression\nThe gender binary was weaponized to justify colonization. The argument was that Europeans were so much more civilized, so much closer to God, than the \u201csavages\u201d who embraced gender nuances. This allowed Europeans to sell the idea of European Supremacy, which allowed the global super-genocide, torture and enslavement of Indigenous people around the world.\nTransphobia is a White Supremacist Legacy of Colonialism\nI still remember the first time I dressed in clothing not socially marked as acceptable for a \u201cboy\u201d to wear. In the\u2026medium.com\nEuropean colonizers marked Indigenous gender and sexual variance as inferior for the purposes of asserting their white cisgender heterosexual manhood as the pinnacle of human existence. \u2014 Michael Paramo\nThe Vatican fears trans people will \u201cannihilate nature.\u201d Nah. It would take galactic amounts of antimatter, and fission reactions larger than several galaxies to annihilate nature. I don\u2019t believe my hormone pills can do that. However, if by \u201cnature\u201d they mean obsolete, oppressive, harmful, patriarchal colonialist structures, then yes, by all means, let\u2019s annihilate that.\nI love the way Anne Hathaway put it:\nAnne Hathaway speaks about the myth of patriarchy, white supremacy, straight/cisgender normativity.\nAlso, this:\nI think one of the reasons why the idea of being transgender, being non-binary, is so threatening, so upsetting to a lot of conservatives \u2014 especially conservative evangelicals \u2014 is because so much of their worldview is based on a capitalistic patriarchy. and coding men and women by hair, clothes, shoes, voice, makeup, is an easy way for them to distinguish between competition and consumables. \u2014 TikTok creator @deconstructivecriticism\nDive deeper!\nWatch:\nbell hooks and Laverne Cox in a Public Dialogue \u2014 The New School\nFeminism & Social Transformation in the Trump Era \u2014 Angela Davis:\nIntersectionality Defined- \u2014 Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw\nWe should all be feminists \u2014 Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie\nThe danger of a single story \u2014 Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie\nRead:\nTrans Women And The Danger of a Single Story \u2014 Where Chimamanda Got It Wrong \u2014 Cassie Brighter\nWhat Do We Do About Women With A Penis? \u2014 Cassie Brighter\nMore Than Just Male and Female: The Six Genders in Ancient Jewish Thought \u2014 Sefaria.org\nGender Diversity in Jewish Sacred Texts \u2014 Keshet Online\nIndigenous Sexualities: Resisting Conquest and Translation \u2014 \nE-InternationalRelations,org\nAncient Persians Recognized At Least Three Genders \u2014 IFL Science\nWomen\u2019s Liberation and Recognition of Trans Women \u2014 Angela Davis", "comment_count": 35, "like_count": 2035, "created_time": 1648851836544, "comment": [{"user_id": "7befda74db4e", "comment_time": 1648851836544, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "e331706e69b0", "comment_time": 1648919006003, "comment": "This is wonderful.

Those letters get copied, and copied, and copied with each new infection, in each new cell, and errors compound. The vast majority of those errors make SARS-CoV-2 a less effective virus. But some have the opposite effect, honing the virus to accomplish the only thing that RNA really wants to do \u2014 make more copies of itself. This is evolution. And this is how variants are born.\nA new variant takes center stage this week \u2014 notable primarily for the dramatic international response to its emergence. Countries around the world are slamming their borders shut. What makes omicron so special?\nThere have been a flurry of stories and rather breathless news reporting on the new variant, and I appreciate that the situation is evolving rapidly, but for now, I wanted to take an opportunity to try to put all the hard facts in one place.\nOmicron timeline.\nFirst \u2014 a bit of timeline. The earliest omicron sample, that we know of so far, was collected on November 9 in Botswana. It was sequenced by South African researchers and uploaded to a central site on November 23. On November 24, South Africa made its report to the WHO. We\u2019re still in the early days.\nBut not that early. As of the time I\u2019m recording this, omicron cases have been identified in more than a dozen countries including Germany, the U.K., China, Australia, and Canada. By the time you watch this, it will certainly have been identified in more. The U.S. instituted a travel ban on South Africa and seven other countries Monday. But I\u2019d honestly be very surprised if it isn\u2019t here already.\nOmicron spike protein mutations. Source: Jeffrey Barrett, Twitter\nOmicron is scary because of the number of mutations in the sequence for the spike protein \u2014 which is the major target of our vaccines as well as the key to allowing SARS-CoV-2 to dock to our cells. This list, courtesy of Jeffrey Barrett highlights those mutations and shows a number that has been in prior variants and a number that is brand new.\nBut, as I\u2019ve discussed before, there are really only three things that practically matter when you are evaluating a new viral variant. One \u2014 how transmissible is it? Two \u2014 how pathogenic is it? And three \u2014 does prior immunity (either from vaccines or survivor immunity) continue to provide protection? Without further ado, here is the best data I could find so far.\nHow transmissible is omicron? The concern that this is a highly transmissible variant is the underlying reason for the robust international reaction. But \u2014 is it more transmissible than, say, delta? Most of the concern centers around this graph, showing the rapid \u2014 some would say explosive \u2014 displacement of delta by omicron in South Africa \u2014 it\u2019s that blue spike at the end there.\nSource: South African presentation to WHO\nBut be careful here \u2014 the Y-axis is the proportion of cases, and South African cases were fairly low recently, as you can see here. That means even a few superspreader events could throw off the curve.\n\nStill \u2014 you can see an uptick in total cases recently in South Africa, and the test positive rates from Gauteng province have skyrocketed from around 1% to 30% over the past week. That certainly gives me pause.\nSource: South African presentation to WHO\nA few other data points on infectivity \u2014 a report from Hong Kong details the case of a traveler from South Africa who tested negative before his flight on November 11 \u2014 he tested positive while quarantining in a Hong Kong hotel on November 13. Concerningly, an individual across the hallway also tested positive for the new variant as well. PCR cycle thresholds for both individuals were fairly low, suggesting they were putting out a lot of virus particles.\nAnd this report from the Netherlands examining 539 travelers from South Africa on Friday has identified 61 Covid cases \u2014 not clear which variant yet but that is clearly a high rate of transmission.\nFor now, it remains unclear just how infectious omicron is \u2014 statements saying it may be five times as infective as delta, for example, are premature, but the concern of higher infectivity is very real.\nWhat about pathogenicity? How sick can omicron make people?\nWe don\u2019t really know yet. However, one Israeli expert reports that, among vaccinated people, there were no serious cases. Still, there are simply too few known cases to have a sense of the case fatality rate.\nBut I do want to point one thing out. There is a lot of armchair evolutionary biology going around that says that viruses mutate to become less lethal over time. This is not correct. Viruses mutate to increase the amount of their genetic code in circulation. While decreased virulence can do that \u2014 by keeping hosts alive longer to spread more virus \u2014 SARS-CoV-2 isn\u2019t that virulent \u2014 this isn\u2019t Ebola \u2014 most people survive a SARS-CoV-2 infection. The best way for SARS-CoV-2 to optimize itself evolutionarily is to mutate to increase viral loads and bind to host cell receptors more strongly. An increase in virulence in order to achieve a higher viral load may well be worth the evolutionary trade-off.\nSARS-CoV-2 Phylogeny. Delta variants are green, omicron is red.\nOkay \u2014 what about immune escape? Mild cases among vaccinated people suggest at least some retention of vaccine efficacy \u2014 that\u2019s good news. Of course, the sheer number of mutations in the spike protein of this variant \u2014 our vaccine target could be a problem. The genetic distance from other lineages, as you can see here, is potentially concerning \u2014 delta lineages are shown in green \u2014 omicron is red, closer to alpha than delta frankly. But immunity is a complicated thing.\nThe number of spike protein mutations in omicron is definitely noteworthy \u2014 this is quite a bit more than seen with the other major variants of concern.\nThese mutations have been associated, in other strains, with resistance to monoclonal antibodies and enhanced transmissibility.\nSource: South African presentation to WHO\nWe\u2019ll get our first information from in vitro virus neutralization assays within a week or so. These will use stored samples of vaccinated sera to see how they protect against the new virus in cell culture. One important note \u2014 South Africa only has around 25% of their population vaccinated, so the spike in cases there does not necessarily mean vaccines are not protective against omicron infection.\nShould the vaccines be updated? Some scientists have argued that a vaccine update should target delta \u2014 since it is so dominant worldwide, the thought was that all subsequent variants would come from delta anyway.\nWell, best-laid plans. Omicron shows us that we might not be able to predict where the next important variant will arise.\nBut one thing is becoming clear \u2014 as long as there are cases of Covid-19, there will be variants. Evolution will occur. Will a variant evade vaccines while retaining infectivity? Not necessarily \u2014 there may not be an evolutionary niche there. But unless we do a much better job vaccinating the world to suppress those cases, we\u2019ll find out.\nA version of this commentary first appeared on medscape.com", "comment_count": 14, "like_count": 1559, "created_time": 1638221014091, "comment": [{"user_id": "f7ca26fead7a", "comment_time": 1638221014091, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "6d54df41ca17", "comment_time": 1638559242339, "comment": "At least precautionary measures like mask-wearing and social distancing should also protect us against this or any other variant."}, {"user_id": "ad0b593b61af", "comment_time": 1638451085099, "comment": "Thank you so much for this excellent information and sense making.

The question is why?\n\nAround 20 million Americans live within 1 km of one of these \u2014 a fracking well.\n\nHydraulic fracturing \u2014 fracking- began in the 50s, but came into its heyday in the 90s, when the technique started being applied broadly to create fissures in deep shale deposits, liberating the natural gas and oil within. If the outcome of interest is the extraction of hydrocarbons, fracking has been an astonishing success \u2014 leading the US to its current position as a dominant force in world oil markets.\n\nBut if the outcome of interest is public health, the story is not so rosy.\nThere have been multiple studies suggesting a link between fracking and a variety of adverse health outcomes, including one \u2014 appearing in Nature Energy \u2014 which found an increased risk of death among elderly individuals living downwind of fracking sites.\n\nBut there have been signals of harm on the other end of the life cycle as well, with this Pennsylvania study suggesting that a pregnant woman\u2019s proximity to a fracking well is associated with adverse birth outcomes.\nWe got some validation of those Pennsylvania findings this week, with this study, appearing in JAMA Pediatrics, which examined the outcomes of over 30,000 pregnancies in Alberta, Canada.\n\nThe analytic setup was fairly straight-forward, given that Canada\u2019s universal health system captures data on all pregnancies. Women were classified, based on postal code, as living within 10Km of a fracking well or not \u2014 you can see the density here along the line of shale deposits.\n\nThe question, then, is whether pregnant women who live close to fracking wells would have a higher risk of adverse birth outcomes.\nThe authors examined five adverse outcomes: spontaneous preterm birth, indicated preterm birth, small for gestational age, major congenital abnormalities, and severe neonatal morbidity or mortality.\n\nAfter adjustment for multiple factors including, importantly, socioeconomic status, there was still a statistically significant increase in small for gestational age infants and infants with major congenital abnormalities.\nTo be fair, the mechanism here is not entirely clear. Fracking uses a slew of chemicals, many of which are classified as toxic to humans, but they are injected deep, deep underground \u2014 well below the level of aquifers and water sources. Groundwater contamination, when it occurs, is often due to spills on the surface.\nThe researchers also note that with a fracking well comes trucking. Trucking brings pollution, which also might affect pregnancies.\nWhether the observed association is causal is still unclear, though the evidence is certainly mounting. To channel Bradford Hill for a minute, I can point out that the best evidence of causality \u2014 experiment- is not going to happen. No one will be randomized to living near a fracking well.\nHill would have liked to see a dose-response effect, whereby individuals living closer to wells would have worse outcomes than those living farther away. The study found no such effect when distance to the closest well was used as the exposure of interest.\nOf course dose is not just distance. The authors did find that living near more wells is worse than living near fewer wells, with those living near greater than 100 wells at the highest risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes.\n\nSo no, this single study is not a smoking gun. In the context of prior studies, though, the gun is a bit smokier. The problem is that the political and economic forces supporting fracking are dramatically more powerful than those supporting the people who live near the wells, who are often quite disadvantaged \u2014 particularly in Canada where mineral rights default to the crown instead of the landowner. Until those individuals start to wield real political power, there will be no fracking ban. It\u2019s not so different in the US.\nIf change will come, it will be by understanding mechanism. The next round of studies need to drill down, pardon the pun, to figure out if these associations are real, what drives them. Is it toxins in the water, or the air, or the soil? Or something else. Until the science is undismissable, I\u2019m afraid it will be dismissed.\nA version of this commentary first appeared on Medscape.com.", "comment_count": 3, "like_count": 82, "created_time": 1649169497228, "comment": [{"user_id": "f7ca26fead7a", "comment_time": 1649169497228, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "b0080e5e354e", "comment_time": 1649377610556, "comment": "Thanks for enlightening us."}], "post_tag": ["Fracking", "Health", "Children", "Pregnancy", "Environment"]}, {"author": "F.

And here, I have a big one. A 12-year-old daughter.\nThis week, a study examining the effect of social media on adolescents, appearing in Nature Communications.\n\nGrowing up is hard. But there is a rapidly growing volume of data suggesting that social media, particularly for young girls, makes growing up harder. Social media takes the regular stresses of adolescence \u2014 the clique-forming, the gossip, the relationships \u2014 and turns the volume up to 11.\nBeyond that, the digital nature of social media means that every social faux-pas can be shared, amplified, reacted to \u2014 literally immortalized.\nStill, the literature regarding the impact of social media has been somewhat limited methodologically. In particular, cross-sectional studies lack the ability to identify which direction the arrow of causality points. It shows a link between greater social media use and less happiness in kids, but are kids less happy because they are on social media more? Or are kids on social media more because they are less happy?\nIn the Nature Communications study, Dr. Amy Orben and colleagues leveraged a large, longitudinal UK dataset to start to tease out the answers.\nOver the past decade or so, families in the UK were surveyed about their overall life satisfaction and a variety of other factors, including their self-reported social media use. It\u2019s a rather large dataset comprising over 70,000 individuals.\nTo start simply, the authors present a cross-sectional analysis. As you can see, the broad trend in this graph is that life satisfaction decreases as you get older. Sorry kids.\n\nBut within various age groups, you see how social media use modifies that effect. Look here at the life satisfaction scores of kids from age 11 to 14.\nLower life satisfaction within each age group as quintile of social media use increases\nWithin any given year, the kids who use more social media (that\u2019s higher numbers on the bottom of the X-axis) have worse life satisfaction scores \u2014 dramatically worse in the case of girls (in red there). That highest-use group, by the way, was reporting 7 or more hours of social media per day, which is, yes, fully possible for a 12-year old girl to achieve.\nBut cross-sectional data only gets us so far. To better tease out causality, the authors looked at how social media use in one year would translate into life satisfaction the following year. And vice versa, how life satisfaction in a given year would translate into social media use in the next year.\nThey found evidence of both effects, in fact, creating something of a feedback loop. More social media use leads to less life satisfaction which leads to more social media use and so on.\nThey were also able to examine when adolescents are most sensitive to the adverse effects of social media.\nWhat you see here is that, among girls, ages 11 to 13 seem to be the prime time for social media to damage life satisfaction, while the age of greatest sensitivity is 14\u201316 years in boys.\nImpact of more social media use (lower is worse) across age groups\nThere\u2019s also an interesting period of heightened adverse effects of social media in both sexes around age 19, which probably corresponds to the time when young men and women are moving out on their own for the first time. A research question for another day, perhaps.\nI should point out that there is social media and there is social media. The study doesn\u2019t have the ability to differentiate between the affects of Facebook or Instagram, Snapchat, or even group-texts, which seem to be how my daughter spends most of her time.\nThe data is fairly consistent and believable. The question really is what do we do with it. I think more and more research is making it clear that social media has profound negative effects on adolescents \u2014 particularly girls.\nSocial media use seems to pose a real risk to young people, and I have to ask \u2014 what is the potential benefit? What purpose does it serve?\nAn article in the Washington Post last week pointed out that our children\u2019s mental health has been on the decline for a while \u2014 not just due to the COVID pandemic.\nSocial media is a part of this. It\u2019s time we admit it.\nIs social media a public health threat? Should social media be treated as we treat cigarettes \u2014 forbidden until you\u2019re old enough? I honestly think the kids wouldn\u2019t mind. The reason kids want to be on social media is because everyone else seems to be on social media. Maybe it\u2019s time that changes.\nA version of this commentary first appeared on Medscape.com", "comment_count": 8, "like_count": 281, "created_time": 1648487207793, "comment": [{"user_id": "f7ca26fead7a", "comment_time": 1648487207793, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "4810922021e2", "comment_time": 1648804759244, "comment": "I agree!

Is it in you?\nStrongyloides stercoralis, known as threadworm to most of the world, and \u201cstrongy\u201d to infectious disease docs who, in this nephrologists\u2019 opinion, are way too familiar with certain pathogens, is a parasitic nematode found in fecal-contaminated soil throughout the tropics and sub-tropics.\nInfection can lead to skin rashes, lung infilitrates and GI bleeding.\nIn those who are immunocompromised or who receive immune suppressing drugs like steroids, disseminated strongyloidiasis can be rapidly fatal, but in most immunocompetent hosts, Strongyloides causes an indolent disease. It\u2019s also life-long \u2014 able to reinfect its host over and over again, unless it is treated.\nAnd the first-line treatment for Strongyloides is\u2026 ivermectin.\nPlease reset the \u201ctime-since-Perry-last-mentioned-ivermectin clock\u201d.\nYes, ivermectin is a powerful anti-parasitic agent. It is its effect on Strongyloides that netted William Campbell the Nobel prize for discovering the drug, and what places ivermectin squarely on the WHO list of essential medicines.\nBut of course, that\u2019s not why we have been talking about ivermectin these days. We\u2019ve been talking about ivermectin because people are using it to treat COVID-19.\nThere are two quite polarized camps here. There are the ivermectin-proponents, many of whom have amassed hundreds-of-thousands of Twitter followers which must be worth, I don\u2019t know, at least 30 dollars, based on the promise that it is a miracle cure \u2014 often touting small studies from developing countries \u2014 some of which have been proven fraudulent.\nAnd then there are the scientists and researchers, and I admit I fall into this group, that point out that the best data we have suggests ivermectin has no meaningful effect on clinical outcomes in COVID-19.\nCould Strongyloides bring these two parties together?\nThis paper, appearing in JAMA Network Open, makes the case.\n\nThe argument is pretty simple. Ivermectin doesn\u2019t have an effect on COVID-19 per se. But people infected with COVID-19 get steroids, which can exacerbate latent Strongyloides infections.\n\nThat\u2019s where ivermectin helps.\nAnd, in places where lots of people have latent Strongyloides infections, it might appear that ivermectin helps more.\nTo test this hypothesis, the authors searched the literature for ivermectin randomized trials.\nNow, this is a rather painful activity. The ivermectin literature, perhaps because of the massive level of public interest, is of highly variable quality, with several of the largest studies that suggested the drug could save lives later turning out to be fraudulent. Other studies have never gotten proper peer review and vanishingly few have released their data publicly.\nThe authors started their search at a very pro-ivermectin website which claims to be running a \u201clive meta-analysis\u201d of over 151 ivermectin studies. Most of those aren\u2019t randomized trials, and several of the ones that are turned out to be frauds, leaving the Authors with a grand total of 12 potentially legitimate ivermectin studies to meta-analyze.\nPutting them together, they find no statistically significant benefit of ivermectin on mortality, though the trend was in a favorable direction with about a 25% reduction in deaths.\n\nBut when the studies were stratified by local Strongyloides prevalence, a pattern emerged. In areas of high prevalence, ivermectin appeared to work better, and in areas with low prevalence, it didn\u2019t appear to work at all.\n\nIs the mystery solved? Is the Gordian knot untangled? Can\u2019t we all just get along?\nThe authors conclude \u201cNo evidence was found to suggest that ivermectin has any role in preventing mortality in patients with COVID-19 in regions where strongyloidiasis is not endemic\u201d. Parsing the double-negative, does that mean ivermectin should be on the table in endemic areas?\nI have no doubt that some will interpret it that way. People who still believe that ivermectin has direct efficacy against COVID-19 will no doubt consider this study a nice justification for its continued use, at least in those parts of the world where Strongyloides is endemic.\nBut is this really the explanation? We have 12 studies here, and sure, there seems to be some correlation between ivermectin efficacy and Strongyloides prevalence, as this graph makes even more clear.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing. With only 12 studies, there are a lot of correlations like this. I looked up the average temperature in the countries where each of these studies was conducted and got an even stronger relationship with ivermectin efficacy, with higher average temps leading to higher efficacy.\n\nIn other words, beware the ecological fallacy. We have 12 data points to work with \u2014 the relationship to Strongyloides prevalence is nice in terms of biological plausibility, but we still need to worry that some of these studies are small, not peer-reviewed, and published in an incredibly high-stakes environment where a positive result might lead to fame\u2026 or infamy. Several supposed trials of ivermectin turned out to be frauds, and it is not impossible that more will be retracted with greater scrutiny. (Authors of these studies, please release your data publicly if you stand behind it).\nMore concerning, the wide-spread use of ivermectin for COVID-19 may ironically make it less available to the hundreds of millions of people around the world who would truly benefit from the drug \u2014 those with threadworm. After all, it\u2019s true that ivermectin saves lives \u2014 we\u2019ve known it for decades. It\u2019s just not clear that is saves the lives of those with COVID.\nA version of this commentary first appeared on Medscape.com.", "comment_count": 2, "like_count": 52, "created_time": 1647907325200, "comment": [{"user_id": "f7ca26fead7a", "comment_time": 1647907325200, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "a1848422f7bc", "comment_time": 1648263010808, "comment": "yet again, solutions taken away from people for whom they would make a massive difference. the sooner the safety of IVM over 40 years is recognised (many studies show it is safer than Tylanol. and the best thing science developed since penicillin) , the sooner we can have free choice once again."}, {"user_id": "6678687e6d23", "comment_time": 1648054030669, "comment": "Thanks for doing the work on this."}], "post_tag": ["Ivermectin", "Covid 19", "Coronavirus", "Medicine", "Science"]}, {"author": "Sinan Aral", "post_id": "77db6d9ca8c8", "user_id": "a0d8245f4406", "title": "Fake News about our Fake News Study Spread Faster than its Truth\u2026 Just as We Predicted.", "content": "Fake News about our Fake News Study Spread Faster than its Truth\u2026 Just as We Predicted.\nSinan Aral is the Director of the MIT Initiative on the Digital Economy and author of The Hype Machine about how social media disrupts our world.\nPhoto Credit: AAAS\nSeveral prominent journalists recently spread misinformation about the science of misinformation\u2026\nThey claimed that a study my colleagues Deb Roy, Soroush Vosoughi and I published on the cover of Science magazine in 2018 had been debunked.

Kuperschmidt wrote, in an article for Science magazine, that our paper \u201cused data on misinformation that had been fact-checked by independent organizations\u2026\u201d and that when Ugander and Juul \u201cfactored in this bias, the difference between the speed and reach of false news and true news disappeared.\u201d Engber picked up on this thread, linked to Kuperschmidt\u2019s article, and tweeted \u201cI love this so much: Remember the Science paper showing that misinformation travels farther and faster on social media than the truth? It was wrong!\u201d\n\nNews of the prominent debunking spread like wildfire. Engber\u2019s tweet was retweeted 390 times and liked over 1200 times within a few days. The quote tweets cheerfully glorified the debunking. Dr Rohin Francis, Medlife Crisis on Twitter, tweeted \u201cAbsolute classic. That study everyone cited with righteous glee, that misinformation spreads faster than true information, was in fact misinformation.\u201d His quote tweet was retweeted 68 times with over 250 likes.\nUnfortunately, for us and for misinformation science, they were all wrong. After fact checking their claims, the journalists discovered that they had been the ones spreading misinformation.\nWhen they talked to Ugander and Juul, they learned that the new study actually confirmed our work and replicated our findings: Fake news did reach more people than the truth, on average, and it did so while spreading deeper, faster, and more broadly through layers of connections. They also discovered that we had ourselves had double checked the generalizability of our results in a separate robustness data set of articles that had never been fact checked, which also confirmed what we had found.\nThree separate replications had confirmed our results and, in fact, since we published our paper, many more studies have replicated our findings in a variety of data sets and contexts.\nTo their credit, both Kuperschmidt and Engber wrote detailed corrections explaining their mistakes and publicly apologized to us, and to Ugander and Juul, for so badly mischaracterizing both of our studies. Science published an official correction the next day. Engber wrote a detailed article about the mistake in The Atlantic titled \u201cSorry, I Lied About Fake News.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, just as our paper predicted, the debunking of their false debunking got nowhere near the attention as their original false claims.\nEngber\u2019s correction only got 35 retweets and 48 likes. Dr Ronin Francis linked to the correction and tweeted \u201cHuh. In the interests of trying to get to the truth, the plot thickens\u2026are all of us who are writing or tweeting about this story\u2026actually proving it right? Seems like it! Thoughtful attempt at correction.\u201d But his correction only received 2 retweets. Kuperschmidt\u2019s well worded correction faired better with 120 retweets. But that too was no match for his original misinformation, which was retweeted 332 times.\nIronically, since falsity spreads faster than the truth, many will now go on believing that our prominent paper has been debunked. This will likely affect the trajectory of the science of misinformation. That\u2019s significant, because our study motivated much of the work dedicated to curbing misinformation in the last five years. Call it collateral damage in the war on misinformation.\nBut there\u2019s actually more to the story\u2026\nOur study not only predicted that this would happen, but also gave an explanation for why it happens. Our paper showed that the speed of false news is correlated with the fact that it is more novel, surprising, shocking and anger inducing than the truth. Engber explained that this was, in part, why he was so drawn to spreading the false debunking. In his correction, he wrote \u201cThis was just the sort of thing I love: The science of misinformation is rife with mind-bending anecdotes in which a major theory of \u201cpost-truth\u201d gets struck down by better data, then draws a last, ironic breath.\u201d He was shocked, maybe even a little angry that our original paper had gotten the attention it did and he was happy to share this surprising new information with his followers. His followers expressed similar reactions: shock, awe and anger.\nIn fact, these are all anecdotal examples of what we called The Novelty Hypothesis. Human attention is drawn to novelty, we gain in status by spreading novel information because we are seen as being \u201cin the know\u201d or having access the \u201cinside information\u201d that may surprise our friends, family and social media followers. We are quick to react to information that is novel, surprising, shocking and anger inducing. That is, in part, why we are 70% more likely to retweet false news than the truth.\nEngber and Kuperschmidt\u2019s misinformation ended up proving our theory \u2014 and not just the headline result, but the mechanisms for why fake news spreads as well.\nThe Novelty Hypothesis: We tend to engage with and retweet novel, shocking, surprising and blood-boiling news more.\nThere\u2019s another reason this type of falsity goes viral. The business models and algorithms of the social media platforms are designed to promote and profit from them. As I wrote in my book The Hype Machine Machine, the attention economy runs on engagement and social media platforms encourage engagement to maximize advertising profits. That\u2019s a simplification and I go through all the empirical evidence for and against this claim in my book. But the basic contours of the argument are by now well accepted. Feed algorithms and friend suggestion algorithms combine to prioritize content that gets more (and thus encourages more) engagement. So it may be that the widely shared false debunking of our study was being promoted by the algorithms too.\nPhoto Credit: Penguin Random House.\nKuperschmidt and Engber\u2019s corrections and apologies are commendable and encouraging displays of professionalism. But it turns out the whole ordeal is a masterclass in misinformation itself. Neither of them intended to spread misinformation! On the contrary \u2014 they both desperately wanted to correct their mistakes and get the truth out! And they tried.\nBut in social media, that\u2019s just not how misinformation works. Falsity spreads faster than the truth and debunking rarely catches up to falsity\u2026 Well, in this case, the debunking of the debunking.\nMaybe this truth, as I have laid it out here, will eventually spread farther than the falsity\u2026 I still have hope.

Start risking felonies for what is good.\u201d When he was arrested, Hunter wore six loaded banana clips for an AK-47-style assault rifle on his vest and had an AK-47, two AR-15s and two pistols in his truck. Federal authorities charged him with traveling across state lines to incite a riot. He was the third member of the Boogaloo Bois, a group pushing to ignite a second civil war, to be charged in Minneapolis.\nOne week from the most consequential election in U.S. history, the greatest threat to our fragile democracy is not the vote, but the violence it could incite. The alleged extremist plots to kidnap the Governor of Michigan and attack Michigan\u2019s capital building could just be the beginning. Russia and Iran have obtained voter data to spread misinformation and sow unrest on American soil. Threats of domestic terrorism are only likely to grow from now to the election and beyond. Several factors are combining to create the kindling that could catalyze a blaze of violence across the country. The spark that ignites that blaze could very well come from social media in the form of fake news and coordinated conspiracies plotted over Facebook or Twitter.\nI\u2019ve conducted some of the largest studies of fake news, filter bubbles and election interference and have investigated the impact of social media on democracy for two decades. In the upcoming election, we face one of the greatest challenges to democracy we\u2019ve ever experienced.\nCOVID-19, social unrest and social media together create a perfect storm threatening the 2020 election and democracy. With uncertainty around the viability of in-person voting, questions about mail-in voting and violent political polarization, foreign actors and domestic terrorist groups will look to leverage the confusion caused by the pandemic and civil unrest to disrupt our democratic process. The pandemic precipitated an unprecedented economic downturn leaving many without jobs, income or a roof over their heads. Record breaking gun sales have created a run on guns and ammunition across the country. Most of the Joint Chiefs of Staff quarantined due to the coronavirus threat in the capital and unease is growing as President Trump refuses to state whether he will accept the election results.\nThese bizarre realities are facts not fiction. But the spread of false fictions could catalyze and accelerate violent extremism in the coming weeks. False news travels farther, faster, deeper and more broadly than the truth online and much faster than attempts to debunk it. My book describes a sweeping and systematic Russian misinformation campaign targeting hundreds of millions of Americans ahead of the 2016 election. Large scale experiments suggest social media accelerates political polarization. But, while the scale and scope of Russia\u2019s 2016 attack was dramatic, the threat of election manipulation and political polarization in 2020 is much higher. Our intelligence community is unanimously warning that Russia is not only actively intervening over social media to spread misinformation, but that they have innovated since their attack on our democracy in 2016. They are nudging rather than impersonating real Americans to spread misinformation to avoid platform policies against inauthentic speech. They\u2019ve moved their servers to domestic soil to avoid surveillance from intelligence services limited in their ability surveil in the U.S. They\u2019ve infiltrated Iran\u2019s cyberwar department, perhaps to launch attacks made to look like they came from Tehran.\nAs I describe in The Hype Machine, during protests and confusion, amidst the smoke, fire and foreign interference, one week from the most consequential election of our time, social media is a real threat \u2014 not only to the election, but to the sanctity and peace of the election process. Research shows that \u201crumors form an essential part of the riot process.\u201d They mobilize ordinary people to do what they would not normally do. They stoke violence through fear. They commit protestors to a line of action they would not normally take and can\u2019t easily retreat from. The Pizzagate shooter was mobilized by social media misinformation. The right-wing extremist plot to kidnap a sitting Governor \u2014 a brazen conspiracy allegedly organized by a group that tested explosive devices and conducted reconnaissance of the Governor\u2019s vacation home in preparation for the attack \u2014 was planned over Facebook. If the election is contested, fake news could escalate the contest to violence. It\u2019s not hard to imagine a scenario in which fake news on social media catalyzes and coordinates domestic terrorism or mass violence in the U.S. during the election or after the votes are counted.\nSocial media companies are rightfully anxious. Just this weekend, Facebook enacted emergency measures to slow the spread of viral content and lower the bar for suppressing inflammatory posts. These types of measures are typically reserved for \u201cat risk\u201d countries like Sri Lanka and Myanmar. They finally banned QAnon, banned new political ads in the week before the election and banned political advertising altogether after the election. They also created new rules preventing a campaign from claiming victory early and removing content questioning the safety and reliability of the voting process or attempting to suppress the vote. Twitter also moved to curb misinformation ahead of the election, notifying users when they are about to spread fake news, nudging users to add context and comments to all retweets between October 20th and election day, and adding contextual information to all trending topics. These are welcome changes. But, they may well be too little and have come too late. These steps should have been taken a long time ago, the platforms should be doing more and the measures shouldn\u2019t just disappear after the election is over. We need sustainable solutions that harden our democracy to foreign and domestic threats for the long term.\nPolicymakers could also do more. If sweeping electoral reform bills like HR 1 are too contentious, surely we can achieve a bipartisan commitment to pass more targeted legislation like the FIRE Act, the SECURE Our Democracy Act, and the Voting System Cybersecurity Act. The release of extra federal funding would have helped states defend elections and voting systems, and risk-limiting audits could preserve the integrity of the vote itself.\nGiven the soft and delayed response of the social platforms and the politicians to date, the defense of our democracy has fallen largely to us, the American people. But, our defense of democracy won\u2019t be mobilized by militias taking up arms. Our bulwark against domestic terrorism and foreign manipulation will be built online, on the keyboards and screens through which we access social media. To succeed, we will need to slow the spread of falsity and report credible threats of violence from social media to state and federal authorities.\nWhen I see fake news shared on social media it is usually preceded by this preamble: \u201cI don\u2019t know if this is true, but it\u2019s really interesting if it is\u2026\u201d We have to stop sharing such stories. Fake news is designed to be \u201cinteresting if it\u2019s true,\u201d but it\u2019s not. The 80\u201320 rule applies to misinformation \u2014 a large fraction of it is easily debunked with a Google search and a few clicks. We have to remain critical of the information we read online because research shows the more reflective we are, the less we believe and share fake news. We also have to check our emotions because fake news is written to be shocking, salacious and anger inducing. It\u2019s made to boil our blood and to hype us up. If you feel your emotional pulse accelerating, take a step back before you believe or share what you\u2019ve read. And check the original source of the information. Fake news tends to come from fake sources masquerading as legitimate news organizations. In particular, we have to be on guard against incitements to violence and news that could incite or motivate that violence.\nThe election results probably won\u2019t be known for days or weeks after the election is over. That is a very dangerous stretch of time during which misinformation could spark riots. We have to be vigilant. During this election the threat of violence and chaos is real and it could be catalyzed by social media. The defense of our democracy will take place online and our bulwarks against domestic terrorism and foreign manipulation will be built on Facebook and Twitter. The digital defense of our democracy is a responsibility we cannot abdicate. We must begin that defense today and continue it long after the election is over and for years to come.", "comment_count": 1, "like_count": 130, "created_time": 1603365804179, "comment": [{"user_id": "a0d8245f4406", "comment_time": 1603365804179, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "5c9aef76ced1", "comment_time": 1603916495734, "comment": "Hi Sinan,"}], "post_tag": ["Election 2020", "Violence", "Civil War", "Social Media", "Boogaloo Bois"]}, {"author": "Matthew Barritt", "post_id": "132110106704", "user_id": "4e19024abd0", "title": "The Wealthy as Politicians", "content": "Artwork by Carolyn Reed Barritt\nThe Wealthy as Politicians\nThe wealthy are habituated to choices that perpetuate their own wealth at the expense of others.

I was thinking of how the writers of this show imagined such a place becoming unbearable if it were truly never ending, and how the protagonists fix this by creating the door, the option of an exit from immortality when they are ready; a metaphor for a long life well lived that also ends well\nI was thinking about the passage of time; decade after decade (and so much longer for these fictional characters) and the extraordinary attainment of eventually being ready for Chidi\u2019s door. Not from pain, or a lack of forbearance, but from a sense of calm completion; internal, comfortable, quiet, accepting.\nI have just barely enough experience witnessing death to have noticed how its approach, in one moment, may fundamentally alter one\u2019s perspective and priorities. How someone who truly understands they are going through that transition may cease to have much in common with even those they love; no longer sharing a frame of reference built on a sense of endless time, no longer seeing themselves through the lens of what they will do tomorrow, a lens like a telescope held to the eye that always looks past what is immediate, and that the rest of us can not put down.\nSo much appears to drop away at that moment, a moment that is suddenly no longer a stepping stone to the next, to what we plan, to the future-based sense of self we have always inhabited. A moment when we accept the absence of tomorrow.\nPerhaps the magic at the end of life is to reach both of these at the same time; quiet, clear, fully present, comforted in a sense of acceptance.\nAnd then I think about the war in Ukraine and the people murdered over the past six weeks, in basements, on the streets, tied to trees in the woods, in their cars trying to escape. I think of the violent deaths imposed on them, quickly, or over the course of days, sculpted by hand from a clay of dehumanizing terror, fear, and pain, and I don\u2019t know what to say.\nExcept to think again about this other, much later, death, perhaps a good death, from a good place, taken from them.", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 4, "created_time": 1649101926917, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["War", "Ukraine", "Death", "Violence", "Inhumanity"]}, {"author": "Matthew Barritt", "post_id": "e3ac4d4851e", "user_id": "4e19024abd0", "title": "Putin and the Death of Svitlana Zhulina", "content": "Putin and the Death of Svitlana Zhulina\nArtwork by Carolyn Reed Barritt\nYesterday I read about the death of Svitlana Zhulina in the Kyiv Independent. Svitlana was a 46 year-old mother who lived in Kyiv with her husband and two young sons. She, one of her sons, and her husband were shot by Russian soldiers as they drove west on the M-06 Zhytomyr Highway, attempting to flee fighting that had come even to the small village of Brezivka where they were sheltering with her parents. She was killed in the first salvo that hit their car. Her youngest son and husband were shot as he tried to pull both children to safety.\nThis happened on March 1st, but the story of her death wasn\u2019t published until yesterday, Friday March 18, the same day that Vladimir Putin held a rally celebrating the anniversary of the annexation of Crimea, and the invasion of Ukraine, in Moscow\u2019s Luzhniki Sports Center, filled to capacity with cheering people. (Even in media-constrained Moscow reporters found attendees willing to describe how they had been compelled to attend from their state jobs or schools and told where to go to board buses that would take them to the \u201cconcert\u201d (Washington Post), (BBC).)\nHere is some of what Putin said from the center field stage (from \u201cConcert marking the anniversary of Crimea\u2019s reunification with Russia\u201d published on the official Kremlin Presidential English language Web site.)\n\u201cThey [the people of Crimea] lived and continue to live on their land, and they wanted to have a common fate with their historical motherland, Russia. They had every right to it and they achieved their goal. Let\u2019s congratulate them first because it is their holiday. Happy anniversary!\n\nWe needed to drag Crimea out of that humiliating position and state that Crimea and Sevastopol had been pushed into when they were part of another state\u2026.\nThere is more to it. The fact is we know what needs to be done next, how it needs to be done, and at what cost \u2014 and we will fulfil [sic] all these plans, absolutely.\nThese decisions are not even as important as the fact that the residents of Crimea and Sevastopol made the right choice when they put up a firm barrier against neo-Nazis and ultra-nationalists. What was and is still happening on other territories is the best indication that they did the right thing.\nPeople who lived and live in Donbass did not agree with this coup d\u2019\u00e9tat, either. Several punitive military operations were instantly staged against them; they were besieged and subjected to systemic shelling with artillery and bombing by aircraft \u2014 and this is actually what is called \u2018genocide.\u2019\n\nThe main goal and motive of the military operation that we launched in Donbass and Ukraine is to relieve these people of suffering, of this genocide. At this point, I recall the words from the Holy Scripture: \u2018Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.\u2019 And we are seeing how heroically our military are fighting during this operation.\u201d\nAnd here are excerpts from the Kyiv Independent story, reported by Anna Myroniuk, about Svitlana Zhulina\u2019s killing (go here to read the full story):\n\u201cIn the early morning of March 1, Svitlana Zhulina was driving her family away from war-torn Kyiv Oblast. Her husband, Andriy Vilson, was sitting next to her, their two sons of eight and 10 in the back seat.\u201d\nAfter two kilometers they saw Russian tanks on the other side of the road and attempted to turn around.\n\u201cSuddenly, Andriy heard a loud explosion and his wife\u2019s head fell against him. A sniper\u2019s bullet had hit her. \u2018It was a horror for the kids. The bullet hit the windshield and their mother who was there just a moment ago [was] gone.\u2019\u201d\nAndriy got out of the car to pull his sons to safety.\n\u201c\u2018I took Artem first,\u2019 Andriy said of his older son, \u2018and they shot me in the right leg. I hid Artem behind the car\u2026.\u2019\u201d\nHe went back for Myroslav.\n\u201c\u2018Myroslav\u2026looked at my leg, saw a big hole in it, and said: \u2018Dad, there\u2019s a hole.\u2019 And right then those bastards shot him in the leg,\u2019\u201d\nAnd then Andriy was hit in the left leg. He could no longer stand. He and his sons lay on the ground as the Russians continued to fire. Eventually Russian vehicles approached and Adriy told his sons to play dead.\n\u201c\u2018When I imagine what it\u2019s like for a child to be told to lie like you\u2019re dead, and your mother is now dead,\u2019 Andriy said, struggling to find words. \u2018It\u2019s just\u2026\u2019\u201d\nWhen they saw them the Russians were shocked, Andriy says, but not enough to avoid checking Andriy\u2019s cell phone, to see if he had shared information about Russian troop movements, before deciding to help them, in the end putting tourniquets on Andriy\u2019s legs to keep him from immediately bleeding to death.\n\u201c\u2018They told me: \u2018You have two kids to take care of.\u2019 I replied: \u2018Thanks to your snipers\u2019,\u201d Andriy recalled. \n\u201cThey then said: \u2018Still, do not die\u2019. I answered: \u2018I will try. Let me save my kids.\u2019\u201d\nThe Russians let Andriy call his parents-in-law in Berezivka and promised not to harm them as they came to pick them up.\n\u201cWhen his parents-in-law arrived, Andriy was feeling dizzy due to serious blood loss, and the Russians helped put him into their car. They did not let them take his wife\u2019s body.\n\u201cLater that day, Svitlana\u2019s parents returned to pick up their daughter\u2019s body anyway.\n\u201c\u2018Grandma and grandpa are heroes,\u2019 Andriy said. \u2018They took a wheelbarrow and went there on foot. They opened the car door in front of the Russians, got their child, put her on the wheelbarrow, took some things that were there, and came back.\u2019\u201d\nI was angry, reading these two stories one after the other; one, once again, about Russian soldiers knowingly shooting civilians, and the other about the blithe rationale presented by Vladimir Putin to justify this in a festive, packed stadium full of a flag waving, cheering crowd and popular music.\nAnd it\u2019s not just Svitlana. At the same time as this rally a large number of people, variously estimated at between 200\u2013300 or up to more than a thousand, were still trapped in the collapsed prison that the basement shelter of the Mariupol Drama Theater had become, two days after it was bombed. Those still alive and trapped were living through a horror during the rally, as they are now still as I write this.\nImagine waging a war that you felt was absolutely necessary to protect innocent lives, as Putin claims this one is; wouldn\u2019t you still feel, and be willing to express, compassion and regret for those innocent civilians (if not soldiers as well) who were killed and harmed in the process? (Much less strive to avoid such deaths?)\nPutin expresses nothing of this. Instead he fabricates a festive celebration of these killings (in essence, though not explicitly) in a desperate effort to shore up the propaganda for this war.\nPutin has said more objectionable things than he did Friday, but context matters: there is something more dangerous here in choosing this setting, something more historically reflective of mid-20th century European history than we should be comfortable with.", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 230, "created_time": 1647730050130, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Ukraine", "War", "Russia", "Vladimir Putin", "Civilian Casualties"]}, {"author": "Matthew Barritt", "post_id": "de6672fe6136", "user_id": "4e19024abd0", "title": "Russian Trolls in the Light of Day", "content": "Russian Trolls in the Light of Day\nArtwork by Carolyn Reed Barritt\nI was reading MacRumors.com some weeks ago after they posted their first story about Ukraine asking Apple to pull out of Russia.

The balance was off.\nAnd I wondered if instead of the Russians being on the way (\u201cThe Russians are coming, the Russians are coming!\u201d), they were already here, just as we know they were in each of our last two elections: searching in our feeds, in our posts, in our publications, early to comment, constantly challenging with distorted narratives, impossible to reason with, and drawing replies as we unknowingly take them at face value.\nSecretly deployed Russian trolls; virtual soldiers in our feeds \u2014 in our homes \u2014 to accompany the army invading Ukraine. Showing their hand only obliquely but still recognizable if we stop to think, and, apparently, not freezing into stone in the partial light as self-respecting trolls should.\nI wish we could turn up the lumens.", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 52, "created_time": 1647185889137, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Ukraine", "War", "Russia", "Trolls", "Transparency"]}, {"author": "David Titterington", "post_id": "eee56f0efe10", "user_id": "73e57d4bcaa0", "title": "Brancusi\u2019s all-seeing eyes and the American Reflexxx", "content": "Brancusi\u2019s all-seeing eyes and the American Reflexxx\n\nThe performance artist\u2019s mirrored face accepts the projections of everyone in the audience. Some people think she\u2019s a dude. Everyone thinks she\u2019s hiding something. The chrome mask used by Alli Coates and Signe Pierce in American Reflexxx is arguably the single element that attracts the mob and incites the violence, and it reminds me of Brancusi\u2019s portraits of women. He had a habit of deleting all the details and rendering women as faceless, generalized, Platonic, shiny, vanishing egg-heads, \u201cgetting all the forms into one form,\u201d as he used to say.\n\n\n\n\nBrancusi, Eileen Lane, 1923\n\u201cNot blind, but one big eyeball,\u201d at once unseeing and all-seeing, the image of total blindness and perfect insight. Brancusi believed that a woman\u2019s face, if obliterated, can symbolize the unitary, all-seeing (because pupilless) eye of the Creator. Smoothing out the details and polishing the mirror expressed for him something transcendent inherent in all humans. Brancusi practiced a form of Tibetan Buddhism and knew all about Mirror Mind. But his treatment of women\u2019s faces arguably also expressed a swelling unconscious cultural hatred toward women. Art historian Carol Duncan points out that 20th-century sculptures of women demonstrate male control and the suppression of female subjectivity more emphatically than sculptures in the nineteenth century or before. \u201cTheir faces are more frequently concealed, blank or masklike (that is, when they are not put to sleep), and the artist manipulates their passive bodies with more liberty and \u201cartistic\u201d bravado than ever.\u201d We see this suppression of subjectivity alive and well in American Reflexxx.\nThe mirror creeps people out, and it helps turn our protagonist into an impersonal, inhuman object for play. I imagine that if she were to take off the mask, just for a second, the madness around her would end, and the crowd would feel horrified and ashamed for following and assaulting this person. But she never takes it off, and the violence goes on and on. Mob moves as a single mind, held there transfixed by her facelessness. Members feel so entitled, so shameless, and so irrational, that they assault her in front of cameras and witnesses.\nCan we identify with the mob? Can we forgive them? Women who have been othered, oppressed and socially diminished now have someone they can pick on, stand on top of, control and oppress. We don\u2019t get to see the face of the woman who pushes the performance artist down, either. Does this help us keep a firm hold on our hatred for her?\nAs the oppressors cannot forgive the actor for wearing a mask, the actor appears to forgive her oppressors unconditionally. In a clever move, she keeps on dancing like it\u2019s no big deal. We get to taste her freedom, her courage, her forgiveness. She is a chrome-colored Christ. Can we identify with the mob? Can we watch a hate crime and recognize the criminal as God in drag, as a Buddha challenging our ability to stay open towards \u201cothers\u201d caught in ignorance?\n", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 57, "created_time": 1559767537655, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Feminism", "Performance", "Art", "Art History", "Gender"]}, {"author": "David Titterington", "post_id": "a0b0639554a1", "user_id": "73e57d4bcaa0", "title": "Sacred Pits", "content": "Sacred Pits\nMore on Landscaping Religion\nIn northern New Mexico there is a church, El Santuario de Chimayo, one of the most-visited holy sites in what we currently call the US. It enshrines a small, circular pit famous for its \u201cmiracle dirt.\u201d Like many religious art installations, the temple was built around the sacred place, which, of course, predates human settlement in that area. However, in this case, it\u2019s not the specific dirt so much as the surrounding place that \u201ccharges\u201d the dirt. According to Olsen Brad, the church replaces the dirt from the nearby hillsides every day, but as theologian Belden Lane puts it, far from being a repudiation of the sacredness of the site, this transfer of dirt is proof of how the sacred extends itself into the profane (2001: 62).\nBelievers also speak of a legendary light emanating from deep in the ground at Chemeyo, and how Bernardo Abeyta on Good Friday in 1810 dug into the light and miraculously found The Black Christ of Esquipulas.\nThe site today, according to Lane, \u201cis abuzz with the anguish of stored lament,\u201d an atmosphere he can only compare to the Wailing Wall in Jerusalem.\n\nThe setup at Chimayo reminds me of Postcommodity\u2019s 2012 installation Do You Remember When, where they opened up a square pit of dirt in the middle of Arizona State University\u2019s gallery floor to create \u201ca spiritual, cultural and physical portal \u2014 a point of transformation between worlds.\u201d\n\nThe circular pit at Chimayo also resembles the pit enshrined in Bethlehem marking the exact site where Jesus was born.\n\nGrotto of the Nativity, inside the Church of the Nativity, Bethlehem, Palestine. In the myth-histories, this star marks the place where Jesus was born. See also the cave-like \u201cDoor of Humility\u201d in Bethlehem.\nSipapu\nLike caves, pits play an important role in our myth-histories. The Hopi believe they emerged from a pit at the bottom of The Grand Canyon, specifically a \u201csipapu\u201d near the otherworldly blue waters of the Little Colorado. This site is forbidden to outsiders, and backpackers who seek it out report strange accidents.\nA sipapu is a circular hole that marks \u201ca portal between worlds.\u201d What\u2019s that? Frank Waters in The Book of the Hopi recalls stories about the first humans being led through a series of \u201cCave Worlds\u201d before exiting into our world through the sipapu. Apparently, when we stepped outside of the pit, we morphed from lizard-like beings into human forms. Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny, and according to Larry Torres, the word sipapu in Uto-Aztecan refers to \u201cthe womb of the Earth.\u201d\nClay also comes from pits by the river, and archaeologists like Ian Hodder talk about a near-universal \u201cAge of Clay,\u201d (aka the Neolithic) when humans lived in clay houses and through clay vessels. There are also a ton of humans-from-clay creation stories, like the Judeo-Christian one, where \u201cAdam\u201d is Hebrew for dirt.\nPits famously configure the lives of the Bimin-Kuskusmin of Papua New Guinea as well. This tribe worships the oil that comes out of a pit in the forest. They believe the oil flows under the landscape itself in \u201cthe realm of the spirit world.\u201d F.J.P. Poole (1986) quotes the tribe\u2019s leader: \u201cThe oil is our blood, our semen, our bone, our heritage from our ancestors\u2026our life.\u201d This connection makes the entire forest a realm of immense ritual and spiritual importance.

Caves, with their shadowy twilight zones, are a great place to start any mythic journey as they are womb-like and occupy a very special place in the religious imagination. Jesus, for example, was born in a cave and resurrected in one; Elijah spoke to his creator outside a cave on Mount Carmel; St. Francis of Assisi meditated naked in Eremo della Carceri; Saint John received his epic dream vision in the Cave of the Apocalypse on Patmos Island; Muhammed met his creator inside the Cave of Hira; Joseph Smith received the plates that would become the Book of Mormon near the Cave of Cumorah, and then hid them there, \u201calong with other sacred treasures\u201d like the Sword of Laban; Bodhidharma, after igniting Zen Buddhism and all martial arts at Shaolin Temple, meditated inside a nearby cave for so long (nine years) that his arms and legs fell off and his eyes dried out! Commemorative eyeless dolls in Japan called Daruma look like black, white, and red eggs. It\u2019s customary to color in one of the empty eyes as a form of good luck magic, and then burn the doll every new year.\nMouth to Bodhidharma Cave near Shaolin Temple.\nThere are a lot of fictional and true horror stories about getting trapped in caves, and a whole genre called \u201csubterranean fiction\u201d that spans Dante\u2019s Divine Comedy (where Hell is a system of caves) to The Three-Body Problem, Broken Earth Trilogy, LOTR, The Matrix, The 100, Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts, American Horror Story: Apocalypse, Lost, and so on. As we now move into homes designed with \u201cZoom Rooms,\u201d we have to wonder if our technology is preparing us for this epochal transition underground already.\nWhat other movies or stories focus on caves? Frozen II for sure, with caves lifted from places in Iceland, maybe pointing to feminist themes in the movie? As they say, yonic is the new phallic!\nAronofsky\u2019s film mother! features a secret cave. At one point, the \u201cmother\u201d fingers a red stain on her floor that opens into a hidden cave where she finds her secret power: fire. Caves also embody what feminist Elaine Showalter (1992) calls the \u201cfemale wild zone.\u201d It\u2019s a place where women can harness and unleash their power.\nPerhaps all openings are caves are vaginas are sources of knowledge. Performance artist Carolee Schneeman famously explored these links in Interior Scroll (1975), versions of which took place inside actual caves. She speaks of a \u201ctranslucent chamber of which the serpent was an outward model.\u201d Bjork likes to sing in caves.\nGrottoes\nWithin art history, caves are where the strange is both hidden and spotlighted. There is a genre of oil painting, Grotto painting, that features chiaroscuro dramas in caves, where the mouth acts as a spotlight and the cave walls are curtains. What is staged often reflects a queerer or more alien world \u2014 literally \u201cgrotesque\u201d which derives from grotto and from Emperor Nero\u2019s cavernous 16th-century palace, Domus Aurea, decorated with frescos representing bizarre motifs inspired by Ovid\u2019s Metamorphoses \u2014 harpies, alien plants, women transforming into architecture, and more!\nThese decorative patterns \u2014 grotesques \u2014 are part of the history of surrealism, horror, fantasy, and are sacred vocabulary: wide-mouthed masks and puking gargoyles are used to decorate churches. Mikhail Bakhtin calls the mouth specifically a main feature of the grotesque (see The Monster in the Garden: the Grotesque and the Gigantic in Renaissance Landscape Design, 2016).\nGrottoes also refer to fake caves built for gardens and parks to evoke the spiritual. They are symbolic but also merely aesthetic: dark places contain deeper colors. Junichiro Tanizaki in his famous essay In Praise of Shadows even argues that shadows are the foundation of a human house: \u201cIn making for ourselves a place to live, we first spread a parasol to throw a shadow on the earth, and in the pale light of the shadow we put together a house.\u201d Check out this kickass episode of Weird Studies Podcast about Tanizaki.\nThe Brain on Caves\nA cave\u2019s darkness, the \u201cdark zone,\u201d does things to us. Caves create conditions like sensory deprivation and Ganzfeld effects (akin to a James Turell light installation) that force the brain to deviate from its normal waking state. According to historian Yulia Ustinova, this is why, in ancient Greece, entering caves was a requirement for visionary or prophecy-giving experiences. I\u2019m thinking of that part of Aronofsky\u2019s film Noah, where Methuselah (Anthony Hopkins) lives in a cave, and Noah (Russell Crowe) sees it in a dream and travels there to receive psychoactive tea that helps him envision the ark.\nApparently, after just a few days of total darkness, the human brain produces more DMT, the endogenous \u201cspirit molecule\u201d partially responsible for dreams and mystical experiences. More, studies using eye-tracking glasses indicate that eye-movement patterns during darkness resemble those during activities involving abstract and divergent thinking. Darkness seems to provoke creativity. Studies also suggest even just brief periods of darkness cause the brain to retrieve ambient magical consciousness. Professor Holley Moyes who studies the archaeology of religion thinks darkness not only makes us hallucinate, it promotes \u201cmagical thinking.\u201d In her 2012 study, volunteers sitting in a dark room were more likely to answer questions in a \u201csupernatural\u201d way, while people sitting in a well-lit room answered the same questions more rationally \u2014 questions like: If you wake up and smell the pipe smoke of your dead grandfather, what is your first explanation? Check out Moyes\u2019s TED talk.\nIt\u2019s the darkness, but it could also be toxic fumes that alter our minds in caves. Some scholars think poisonous cave gasses were responsible for Greek histories and myths. It was probably ethylene, a gas that \u201cproduces feelings of aloof euphoria\u201d (see For Delphic Oracle, Fumes and Visions). Ethylene plus a spike in DMT plus sensory deprivation effects? Given our four-dimensional selves, this all could have helped people foresee a future. Nevertheless, even when completely sober:\nWe do not behold a passive, inert scene but are immersed in a pulsing space, in the currents and energies of a world-in-formation, even in the darkness, and the light or lack of it is entwined with our sensing bodies, blurring distinctions between outside and inside. \u2014 Tim Edensor\nCaves are important destinations for enlightened revelation, and if you don\u2019t live near one, you can still \u201cretreat\u201d by closing yourself up in a dark room or closet, as we see in the Tibetan practice of a dark retreat. You can recreate some of the conditions of a cave, however, the dangers that heighten the body\u2019s awareness cannot be replicated in a dark closet.\nLeonardo\u2019s Cave\nAs drug-laced sacred destinations, caves help information from the margins of consciousness get felt by the mind and transformed into art. Leonardo Di Vinci famously had a powerful experience with a cave as a young man. He stumbled upon one in the forest that caused him to feel two contrary emotions at once, fear and desire, \u201c \u2014 fear of the threatening dark cavern, desire to see whether there were any marvelous things in it.\u201d He went in, and after that episode recorded in his diary, Leonardo started drawing helicopters, tanks, and advanced geometry. Ancient Aliens wonders if inside that cave Leonardo was beamed visions from elsewhere. Maybe he fell into a portal to the future, or to his own 4D \u201clong self.\u201d Around this time, he also went missing for two years! Alien abduction? Maybe, or maybe he was just laying low after being charged with sodomy \u2014 I think he was 24 \u2014 a traumatic event he never got over. Leonardo remained celibate for the rest of his life.\nWhat else do caves represent?\nIt\u2019s not the world in which we live our daily lives, but the unseen, underground world where people live out their fantasies that has power.

He is featured in The Geometry of Angels (1998), where mathematician Ralph Abraham teams up with William Irwin Thompson to analyze one of the friar\u2019s visionary paintings from 1435. It\u2019s the Annunciation. The angel Gabriel informs Mary she\u2019s pregnant with a god, and his golden wings create a series of ellipses. If we \u201cpull\u201d the 2D ellipses into 3D spheres, Abraham wonders if the wings could represent Dante\u2019s 3-sphere universe \u2014 two intersecting onion-like wholes\u2014 an image that was on everyone\u2019s mind at the time.\nIn the context of Renaissance math and linear perspective, Abraham adds that the flapping wings generate a family of toroids:\nEach wing represents a circle. By stretching out the wings and flapping them, the angel carves out the tori of the cosmic three-sphere. As two spatial dimensions plus movement makes three dimensions, the flight of angels may be seen as a construction of the world, and a means of navigating between the Ball of Heaven and the Ball of Earth.\nWhat a vision! This is really exciting because that family of toroids creates a Hopf map, a topological shape not uncovered in mathematics until the 1930s! You can create your own Hopf map here. Essentially, it\u2019s a series of rings that show how a 4D sphere (aka 3-sphere, hypersphere, or \u201creal\u201d sphere) can be mapped by a collection of 2D ellipses. One interesting property of this shape is that each ring or \u201cfiber\u201d is linked with the others exactly once.\nPhysicist Roger Penrose marked the Hopf fibration \u201can element of the architecture of our world,\u201d and mathematician Eric Weinstein said to Joe Rogan \u201cit\u2019s the most important object in the entire universe.\u201d It\u2019s also called a \u201cprincipal bundle,\u201d what the universe \u201cis based around,\u201d a shape not really understood until the 1970s, yet Fra Angelico painted one in 1435 disguised as some angel wings!?\nThis isn\u2019t the first time an artistic vision predicted a scientific discovery. See Leonard Shlain\u2019s book Art and Physics or Jonah Lehrer\u2019s Proust was a Neuroscientist. Dante pre-cognized the 3-sphere in the 14th century with his poetic comedy. Check out Dante and the 3-sphere by Mark Peterson, and read more about fibrations here.\nStephen Lipscomb\u2019s illustration of Dante\u2019s \u201c3-sphere Universe.\u201d\nThe Hopf map or 3-sphere (S3), composed of fibers, \u201cwhere each fiber is a circle \u2014 one for each point of the 2-sphere.\u201d Mathematician Nico Belmonte, describing the image above: \u201cYou are probably now thinking \u2018but what does a 4D sphere actually look like?\u2019 You can\u2019t really see it, but here we use a stereographical projection to show some points of a 4D sphere into 3D space.\u201d\nVisualizing the Invisible\nAs a 4D sphere, the Hopf fibration models the \u201cfoundation\u201d for the 4D world (space + time). Humans are at least 4D beings (with a \u201clong self\u201d), even if we feel locked in 3D. We can\u2019t see 4D it with our eyes, but we can fantasize.\nIn his book Art Meets Mathematics in the Fourth Dimension, Steven Lipscomb tells the story of the \u201cquest to imagine the elusive 3-sphere.\u201d Gustave Dor\u00e9 tried in the 1830s, Edwin Abbott Abbott tried with Flatland (1884), and in 1917, Albert Einstein visualized the universe as a 3-sphere (without the aid of Planet Hopf) describing the image as \u201cthe place where the reader\u2019s imagination boggles. Nobody can imagine this thing.\u201d\nFra Angelico can. In this version of the Annunciation, he added sand to the paint so that in candlelight the fiber-wings sparkle like star fields. In this version, a black-and-white figure living above the world offers a golden orb that floats down to Mary and Gabriel\u2014reminiscent of the annunciations in Part 8 of Twin Peaks. I\u2019m also reminded of the fictional sophons from The Three-Body Problem \u2014 a family of proton-sized supercomputers capable of unfolding and infolding dimensionally \u2014 sent to earth by aliens.\nIn this version, a tiny angel dressed in red expels people from Eden, while the Father, disguised as black-and-white art, watches over his mystical insemination. Mary looks like a giant.\nWhat\u2019s noteworthy about Fra Angelico\u2019s Annunciations \u2014 besides the embedded Hopf bundles \u2014 is that angel and human mirror each other, arms crossed like they\u2019re dead, or, like they\u2019re both holding invisible babies. The liturgical gesture can also signify mourning and baptizing.\n\nDetails from a Fra Angelico Annunciations.\nTori, with their ascending/descending currents, appear in Alex\u2019s Grey\u2019s paintings of our subtle and causal bodies. Grey calls one a \u201cguardian angel,\u201d \u201ctoroidal ball of spiritual light,\u201d and \u201cMobius Sphere.\u201d Is it the With?\nAstrophysicists point out that our sun also has a large toroidal field surrounding it that is itself embedded inside a larger torus encompassing our galaxy. Some cosmologists go as far as to claim that the spinning 4D torus, symbolized by a 2D figure 8 or \u221e, represents \u201cthe fundamental form of balanced energy flow found in sustainable systems at all scales, from micro-atomic to macro-galactic.\u201d Designer Jois Pon envisions more practical applications with his Torii Pods, always motivated by the natural flow of things. Philosopher Peter Sloterdjik also has a lot to say about tori and \u201cbiunities\u201d and \u201csphereologies\u201d in his book, Bubbles (2011), the first volume in his Spheres trilogy. Sloterdjik:\nAll births are twin births; no one comes into the world unaccompanied or unattached.\nAlex Grey, Yogi and Mobius Sphere, 1987.\nHopf fibration overlaid on Fra Angelico\u2019s Gabriel.\nFurther, to describe the feeling of \u201cbeing-in-the-world,\u201d Sloterjik uses Thomas Aquinas\u2019s idea of angels \u2014 that they are \u201cnot like physical creatures in space but that they created out of themselves the space that they illuminate and animate with their essence\u201d(2017:190). It\u2019s like what Maurice Merleau-Ponty says in The Primacy of Perception (1964:5): \u201cThe body is not in space, it inhabits or haunts space.\nIt applies itself to space like a hand to an instrument, and when we wish to move about we do not move the body as we move an object. We transport it without instruments as if by magic.\nWhat this all means is that Fra Angelico paints invisible shapes to be \u2018seen\u2019 or rather enacted by the viewer\u2019s own imagination, aided by perception\u2019s inclination towards closure and boundary completion (see Finding out about filling-in). It also means that, according to Fra Angelico, angels create three-dimensional space by beating their wings, and in a sense so do humans.\n\u201cPlanet Hopf\u201d\n", "comment_count": 1, "like_count": 66, "created_time": 1641438974447, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Art History", "Painting", "Spirituality", "Mathematics", "Philosophy"]}, {"author": "Neha Doshi", "post_id": "832829f68489", "user_id": "dece946149c6", "title": "How Enlightenment Thinkers Framed the Original \u2018Cancel Culture\u2019 as \u2018Progress\u2019 and \u2018Civilisation\u2019", "content": "How Enlightenment Thinkers Framed the Original \u2018Cancel Culture\u2019 as \u2018Progress\u2019 and \u2018Civilisation\u2019\nWhy the \u2018cancel culture\u2019 debate fails to recognise how European thought has erased (and continues to erase) whole cultures, histories and civilisations simply because they don\u2019t fit middle-class European norms\nGordon Bennett, Possession Island (Abstraction), 1991\nThe \u2018cancel culture\u2019 debate winds me up. Particularly when academics claim that they are afraid of expressing their \u2018true\u2019 findings for fear of losing their careers. Brushing aside the tempting opportunity to ridicule many frames of reference in that sentence (I mean, don\u2019t get me started on the word \u2018true\u2019, let alone \u2018career\u2019), let\u2019s consider the history of academia and who\u2019s actually been allowed to speak.\nThe men of the Enlightenment era\nIt\u2019s no secret that in Europe during the 18th and 19th centuries, men were deemed rational, stoic and able to keep their emotions in check while women were seen as irrational, frivolous, prone to affection and hysteria. It was therefore only men who were given approval to debate, critique and formulate ideas. While men were out dueling with words, women were confined to the household frolicking and fretting about in frocks.\nBut this well recognised narrative ignores the ways in which ideas around class and race also inferiorised whole swathes of people. For starters, working-class white men and women had no say in how matters were run, and men and women of colour were even less sought out for opinion (a slave master\u2019s gentle gesture would be to ask his slave if she had eaten before proceeding to rape her). So it became normal practice to speak on behalf of and for groups of people subject to study. The responsibility of those deemed more advanced and intelligent (white middle-class men) was to teach those who lacked such skills for they did not know what was best for themselves.\nThis remains true today. Those who guarded the gates 200 years ago continue to gatekeep today. Cis, white, able-bodied individuals speak on behalf of people of colour, study us and stand as heads of departments of \u2018Indigenous affairs\u2019 or \u2018world literature\u2019 or \u2018post-colonial studies\u2019. \u2018Decolonisation\u2019 is such a ubiquitous term that it has become meaningless \u2014 to speak of decolonisation already gives one woke credits (you don\u2019t even need to prove your commitment to the cause).\nEnlightenment ideas\nOur contemporary models for thought are based on Enlightment frameworks: the way in which we categorise begins through a process of seeing. For example, although we \u2018see\u2019 race, race doesn\u2019t exist as a scientific concept \u2014 what we \u2018see\u2019 therefore is a framework for thinking about skin tone, hair, body shape etc as belonging to racial groupings. In other words, even though there is no one gene linking a \u2018race\u2019 of people, we look at skin tone and imagine that someone belongs to a particular \u2018race\u2019. We can argue similarly for gender and sex in that the way in which we \u2018see\u2019 gender is through a process of socialisation that separates people with different genitalia, arguing that men and women occupy oppositional spheres of humanity and therefore think, behave, act and perfom differently. This specific manner of seeing began in the Enlightenment with its obsession for categorising, ranking and fitting people into boxes from which they couldn\u2019t escape.\nNot only has this meant that certain people have not been given space to speak, it has also resulted in a narrowing of the possible ways in which we could view the world. It has delegitimised practices deemed irrational (such as meditation) and forced racial and gender hierarchy upon cultures who did not subscribe to these norms. Contrary to popular belief, gender hasn\u2019t always been binary \u2014 many cultures either don\u2019t have a word for \u2018male\u2019 or \u2018female\u2019 or have more fluid concepts of gender.\nCivilisation and progress\nWhen Europeans took over lands in what we now call the \u2018global south\u2019 (Africa, Asia) part of their mission was to reap resources that would fund the capitalist machine in Europe; their other project was to civilise. They considered those of darker skin (the Irish were also included in this category because the process of racialisation is slightly more complicated but that\u2019s a discussion for another day) inferior and proceeded to enforce systems that would make Asia and Africa fit in line with European standards. This included stamping out sexualities and genders that conflicted with European norms. (Only in the last decade has India rescinded laws imposed by the British banning homosexuality and being transgender).\nSo whole histories were actively erased in the name of progress. Indigenous Australian storytelling methods were overwritten because the languages\u2019 lack of written script was regarded as a sign that Aboriginal people did not possess capacity for thought. India\u2019s Hijra (transwomen) community was forced into hiding because a human existence became illegal. Familial structures found in more pastoral communities were made to dismantle because individualism began to trump community belonging.\nThe effect of this \u2018cancelling\u2019 of ways of being should not be understated. No one has yet been charged with administering the Stolen Generation in Australia, a genocidal pogrom aimed at assimilating Indigenous Australian into white Australia by forcibly removing children from their homes, leaving them subject to physical and sexual abuse, neglect and and slave labour. Even more ludicrously, former Prime Minister Tony Blair who sanctioned a war on Iraq despite the UN\u2019s disapproval has been knighted \u2014 if we compared it to the situation between Russia and Ukraine, that would be like giving Putin an Oscar award for best wartime performance.\nThe debate around \u2018cancel culture\u2019 ignores who actually does get cancelled and overlooks who has never been allowed to speak.\n\u2018Cancel Culture\u2019 and academia\nWhat frustrates me about the \u2018cancel culture\u2019 debate is the way in which critiquing the primacy of the norm is deemed seditious. When people talk about being afraid of losing their careers, do they recognise that being given the opportunity to pursue a career is already privilege? If an article has been written about you being \u2018cancelled\u2019, you\u2019ve been given a platform many of us would dream of.\nWhat\u2019s more, I worked in the English department of a secondary school in Wimbledon and a day wouldn\u2019t go by when I wouldn\u2019t hear a casually racist remark. These white women had never been cancelled, nor were they likely to be because the system was such that I would have had to make a formal complaint and they would have been given opportunity to respond. I, as the only person of colour in the department, would have been put into a precarious position in regards to my own career had I decided to formally critique their behaviour. There was no guarantee that my choosing to \u2018call out\u2019 their racism would have resulted in anything other than attracting the ire of the people I worked with.\nBut this article isn\u2019t a rant about meritocracy, it\u2019s an indictment of the whole manner in which knowledge is presented. The fact that we have so few black professors also indicates who gets to study and who becomes the subject of study (even my statement is proof of the way in which people of colour are almost always studied through lenses of deficiency). Our use of \u2018Indigenous\u2019 Australia whitewashes a whole history of people who Europe homogenised, a people Europe decided they could lump together because their practices were presumed lacking in legitimacy. By labelling their \u2018mobs\u2019 and their country, we render them visible, but only through a half-process, only in hindsight, and only as niche knowledge. European thought removed their subjectivity \u2014 it is now on a mission to revitalise what has already been lost.\nWhen \u2018cancel culture\u2019 becomes a greater point of discussion than the questions being put forward by the critique, we prove just how committed we are to normativity. \u2018Cancel culture\u2019 has become the catch-all phrase for anything attempting to criticise, to reframe, to bring subjectivity to groups of people whose voices have been previously silenced. And I speak with passion about this subject because I spent my adolescent years being told that what I understood about my own culture was incorrect and invalid. The gatekeepers of knowledge reduced my very being into a subject of study, a \u2018project\u2019 of improvement. Learning to have a voice means learning how to use my double-consciousness to my advantage, and how to know myself in relation to others like me, not in relation to whiteness.\nAn Injustice!\nA new intersectional publication, geared towards voices, values, and identities!aninjusticemag.com", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 65, "created_time": 1649081010781, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Cancel Culture", "Debate", "Academia", "Enlightenment", "Erasure"]}, {"author": "Neha Doshi", "post_id": "be287cbe4c68", "user_id": "dece946149c6", "title": "Gratefulness Can Limit Us", "content": "Gratefulness Can Limit Us\nBeing told that things could be a lot worse shouldn\u2019t prevent us from fighting for something better\nPhoto by Miguel Bruna on Unsplash\nIn an argument about gender roles my aunt told me that I should count myself lucky because my parents give me greater freedom\u00a0than\u00a0most\u00a0girls\u00a0receive.\nCue exasperated eye-roll. I\u2019m 30. Unwed, but/and fucking 30. I do not need to be grateful for the fact that my parents don\u2019t feel the need to check up on my whereabouts, nose into my dating life, or \u2018allow\u2019 me to live alone. Yet, my parents\u200a\u2014\u200awho treat me like I\u2019m an adult human capable of knowing what\u2019s best for myself\u200a\u2014\u200aare amongst the few in my community who aren\u2019t so heavily gendered in their approach to parenting. It\u2019s almost as if I\u2019ve been raised as a boy!\nBut, here\u2019s the thing \u2014 I haven\u2019t been. I\u2019ve been raised as a girl in a large Gujarati Jain (Indian) extended family. My grandfather\u2019s brothers and their male children manage an international family business but, I, as female, am barred from partaking in any family business ventures. What\u2019s more, since the age of 24, relatives have paid little attention to my career aspirations and have expressed far more concern over my marital status. In fact, there\u2019s a 6-figure budget set aside for a wedding (that I have never wanted) but a refusal to pay for my Masters or PhD programs.\nWhile this gendered predicament may sound specific to me, being told to feel \u2018grateful\u2019 for what I have because it could be a lot worse isn\u2019t. Granted, I have much to appreciate: the affection and care I receive from my family is infinite, I\u2019ve always been incredibly financially privileged and I know where I come from \u2014 I know that I have homes in the plural. So yes, things could be a lot worse. But knowing what I have is not the same as being grateful. And here I\u2019m going to make a controversial statement \u2014 gratefulness can sometimes limit us to our box and prevent us from striving for something better.\nFor generations, oppressed people struggling for justice have been made to remember times when things were worse. When civil rights leaders in the US were fighting against Jim Crow laws, they were told, \u201cbe grateful you\u2019re not slaves anymore\u201d. When migrant workers complained about poor working conditions, they were told, \u201cbe grateful we\u2019ve let you into this country\u201d. And when women fought for suffrage, they were told, \u201cbe grateful you can own your own property\u201d. In other words, they were advised to sit down, shut up and know their place, because what they have now is as good as it\u2019s going to get.\nArguments attempting to diminish the experience of oppression will often resort to statements that the situation is worse elsewhere. Frantz Fanon, in Black Skin, White Masks, challenges a similar refutation that France is a racist country. Octave Mannoni, a French psychoanalyst, wrote several papers claiming that the US and South Africa had racist structures that could not be seen in France and Fanon derisively summarises Mannoni\u2019s central thesis: \u201cBe glad that you are French, my fine Negro friends, even if it is a little hard, for your counterparts in America are much worse off than you\u201d. The issue with this logic is that 1) a (worse) problem in one country doesn\u2019t negate that the problem exists in another country; 2) it minimises what injustice is prevalent and 3) it\u2019s an easy answer to rebuff responsibility.\nIn the case of my family situation, the notion that I needn\u2019t complain because my parents are \u2018different\u2019 is problematic on several counts. Firstly, the fact that my parents stand out implies that women in general are not treated as having as much agency and control over their own lives as men are. Secondly, the fact that my parents have \u2018allowed\u2019 me greater independence doesn\u2019t do away with the sexism that continues to exist (within my family and in society at large). Thirdly, the implication that I am complaining by advocating for greater recognition of women\u2019s subjectivity reduces my fight for equality to a selfish whim. So while there\u2019s much to acknowledge and value in my upbringing, I reject any demand to be grateful for what I believe should be a fundamental right: to be treated as human and not woman (to loosely paraphrase Simone de Beauvoir). In fact, if I clung\u00a0to\u00a0gratefulness, I wouldn\u2019t have the zeal to fight against injustice\u200a\u2014 I\u2019d perpetuate prevailing problems because I\u2019d know that things were fine for me and that\u2019s all that matters.\nIn today\u2019s divisive world, my words may appear incendiary. I\u2019m not insinuating that there is no place for gratitude\u200a\u2014\u200aindeed, intersectional feminism asks us to consider our positions of privilege (as well as oppression). But the sentiment of gratefulness is far more politically charged, told to the underprivileged as a way of preventing them/us from dreaming bigger. Gratitude is recognition, awareness and appreciation of what we have. It may actually be healthy to practice gratitude. Gratefulness, on the other hand, is subservience to what we have. It traps us in patterns of poor treatment and kills the revolutionary spirit\u00a0through\u00a0guilt. It is not enough to say that my circumstance is better than the norm, rather, we should be striving to make the norm better.\nI dare to dream bigger, and in daring, I refuse gratefulness.\nAn Injustice!\nA new intersectional publication, geared towards voices, values, and identities!aninjusticemag.com", "comment_count": 4, "like_count": 215, "created_time": 1643552841425, "comment": [{"user_id": "dece946149c6", "comment_time": 1643552841425, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "d3826925e7df", "comment_time": 1643728166987, "comment": "If I could highlight this whole article, I would.

Not groundbreaking, I\u2019m sure, but nonetheless revelatory. Despite being an ardent, in-your-face, fuck men feminist, I seek validation from men.\nI need men to tell me that I\u2019m intelligent, that I\u2019m admirable, that I possess wonderful qualities, and that the world would be a bleak and dismal place without me in it. Needless to say, without this affirmation \u2014 from cis white heterosexual men \u2014 I am no one, I offer nothing to the world, and I may as well give up on dating because who do I think I am anyway?\nWhich brought me to my second epiphany: I idolize the achievements of my (cis white heterosexual male) romantic interests while denigrating my own, resulting in feelings of intense inferiority and bouts of depression and anxiety.\nI don\u2019t for the life of me want to work in finance, least of all actuary (the job of my ex-boyfriend \u2014 I think they offer actuaries a high salary to compensate for a lifetime of being boring), nor be a political-educational YouTuber (the job of my most recent romantic interest), waging Twitter wars. I\u2019d rather spend a day with Enoch Powell (British politician who made the infamously racist \u201cRivers of Blood\u201d speech in 1968) than half an hour exchanging asinine arguments of you\u2019re a twat, no you\u2019re a twat as the only way to be incisive in 150 characters or less.\nSo why do I do this? Why do I \u2014a well-informed and socially conscious individual who has made it a life goal to educate people on race and gender (hence my choice of PhD in race, podcasting, and social media) \u2014 decide that my male partner is magnificent but that I\u2019m common and lacking? And how do I begin to unpack this internalized (white supremacist) patriarchy?\nI was dumped by my ex-boyfriend five months ago. He had never loved me, he had loved being loved by me. So I did the natural and moronic thing of dating very soon after as a \u201cfuck you\u201d to my ex, feeling that male attention would solve all my complexes and insecurities.\nUnsurprisingly, male attention did no such thing. In fact, I ended up having an anxiety attack in the YouTuber\u2019s bed, leading to a confusing agreement to stay friends and an eventual decision on my part to cut ties because I knew that I would never be happy with a platonic relationship. What I had wanted from this man was for him to serve as a balm to my aching loneliness, to my deep sense of being inadequate, and to bring with his care and attention a certainty that I had a place in this world.\nI was not only asking for the impossible, I was deciding that his interest and attention would be the key to my belonging.\nWhat\u2019s more, I was willing to attribute favorable qualities to his failings, as I have done time and time again with men. I considered a lack of willingness to communicate emotions or display vulnerability as signs of being stoic and elusive\u200a\u2014\u200atraits that society rewards in men, but that actually led to my anxiety in the first place because I felt emotional and irrational by contrast. The whole situation panned out in distinctly gendered ways.\nBut I recognize the inflated value I place on men as I write these words. If I were reading this article written by another woman, I would be shaking my head and thinking but doesn\u2019t the whole of feminist literature tell us that we are worth so much more than the male gaze allows?\nYes, yes it does. It tells us that friends are our community, that the nuclear family is a social construct that positions women as subordinate, that being in a romantic relationship is not a measure of success.\nYet, this yearning need for approval from a man persists.\nI recently got in touch with a male friend from my undergraduate degree who I haven\u2019t spoken to in about 10 years because he had ghosted me and we decided to Zoom. But as the sun-kissed, sandy-haired, beautiful beach boy from Australia looked back at me from the screen, I wondered, why had I chosen to do this? Was I, yet again, trying to replace one man with another in my life? Why were the loyal, compassionate, generous (female and non-binary) friends of mine who answer my call not enough?\nI don\u2019t yet have answers to these questions, but I might quote bell hooks here and say it\u2019s at least in part related to the \u201cImperialist White Supremacist Heteropatriarchy\u201d. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the only hetero cis woman stuck in this position wondering why finding meaning without a man feels like such a knotty and perplexing task.\nSo how do I begin this process of learning to appreciate the value I bring to my community and not just another man?\nUnderstanding my worth will likely take years of unravelling, and much affirmation from female friendship. But I can start there, by practising what bell hooks calls revolutionary love. One of my friends once poignantly asserted that the most liberating lesson she learned from feminism is that women are not our competition, but our allies, our safety net. I consider myself bloody lucky to have my community of female friends to lean on.\nAn Injustice!\nA new intersectional publication, geared towards voices, values, and identities!aninjusticemag.com", "comment_count": 7, "like_count": 357, "created_time": 1641826065141, "comment": [{"user_id": "dece946149c6", "comment_time": 1641826065141, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "56827e87febd", "comment_time": 1642116337498, "comment": "Wow, amazing self actualisation.

Instead they attacked and that led me to practically NEVER reading Medium comments since then.\nLuckily, this trend is slowly reversing, and the release of this book had led to the first time senior practitioners (20+ years) reached out to me congratulating on the effort.\nI faced mostly hate from the UX industry, with claims I\u2019m an troll at best, and a total disgrace to UX at worst.\nYet the numbers are there. My work has directly or indirectly helped over 10,000 people worldwide with over a hundred of them getting their first UX job after months of rejections.\nWe should be inclusive\nMy attempts at dry humor and dumbing down UX are because I want more people in, not because I want to downplay the people who are already in. After all \u2014 I am \u201cin\u201d this industry \u2014 so saying it\u2019s easy and anyone can learn it also undermines me here. I am completely fine with that and I\u2019m happy to hear it resonates.\nI decided to divide ux methods and concepts into ones used in the real world, and ones practically never used.\nThe more people will join the industry, the more we can collectively learn from each other. Over the last two years I can honestly say I learned more from the problems of junior or aspiring designers than from any senior out there. They simply have a good attitude that\u2019s a pleasure to be around.\nI\u2019m a junior designer with 23 years of experience\nIt really isn\u2019t that hard\nSure, when you mix in things that normally weren\u2019t even the job of a UX designer \u2014 like long term product strategy it does get more difficult. But most people won\u2019t be really doing strategy.\nWhat they will be doing is moving some Figma or Sketch rectangles based on the responses from a simple survey they conducted.\nThat\u2019s why it was difficult for me to share my \u201cUX book\u201d with people \u2014 I was expecting that 50/50 ratio of love to hate. So far, however, I get so much love and support it\u2019s overwhelming! Sure, some hate is there, but it\u2019s less than 1%. Most people love it and that gives me motivation to continue!\nI decided to divide ux methods and concepts into ones used in the real world, and ones practically never used.\nAnd yes \u2014 I am sharing MY OWN experience with how I work on digital products, but many people are now reaching out saying that they do it exactly (or pretty much) the same way at their companies.\nGood to hear!\nLet\u2019s do good sh**!\nThis is my primary goal. I want more people in the industry because that way we\u2019ll have more groundbreaking patterns like Pull to refresh emerging and most products won\u2019t look and feel exactly the same, with neglected UI and reused IA patterns but with a lot of meeting room talks and \u201cprocess\u201d work that results in a copy of how other sites or apps do it anyway.\nLet\u2019s get creative and let\u2019s push digital products forward.\nI believe people who are just now entering the industry will redefine it the most.

Just moments ago, I followed signs with the Italian flag to ski from Zermatt at the highest station in Europe down a fast and sharp ride over an arbitrary peak \u2014 one of many \u2014 that dropped me into a different country. I continued on; there was no reason to stop. The undulations were new for my legs. Unexpected drops and twists and ice patches greeted me like plates of a chef\u2019s tasting menu or fresh pages of a novel.\nWanting to understand them a little better, I took the chairlift over the relatively short piste. On my lonely little chair, I tootled along, investigating what was below my dangling feet and thinking about what it meant to be on the other side. As soon as ideas of nationhood entered my brain, all the horrific news from breakfast flashed off the glittering ice crystals.\nIs this the way a conscripted Russian soldier feels in the forests of Ukraine? What does a Ukrainian refugee think of the snow beneath their feet in Poland?\nI had every intention of flying down the same trail again, taking the chair back, and continuing on my way. But something drew me to the little lodge with the flags I had passed. It was within reach; only a few pole pushes were necessary for me to arrive.\nMaybe I needed more of a rest because of the horrific images of children dying that swirled in my head. Not to escape, but to be with these thoughts, to grieve even, and try to unload some of their burden, as irrational as it sounds. Money and time and political acts (including art and writing the truth) are what will help, but we also need to reflect on what we see. Reflection helps us grow, and a world of growing individuals will make a better future.\nAs I went into the little lodge, people greeted me: buon giornio! The Italian spoken amongst the waiters mimics the movement of the mountain tops. My latent Italian came back to me; well, enough to order an espresso. Un caff\u00e9 per favore? Grazie mille! The coffee is excellent. Much better than the other side. And, it\u2019s a third of the price. I paid in Euros that I keep in a separate compartment from the Francs in my wallet. Because it was 1.50, I gave the waiter 2 and he rang a massive cow bell to thank me for the tip.\nNow I sit at the window, drinking a coffee and thinking about the world. Here, I am considering this threshold. The arbitrary spot of border, invented by humans. Too often places of sadness and exclusion. Should we obliterate them? The cosmopolitan open-bordered world seems vacuous, globalised and robotic. Instead, I am thinking about how we can re-signify our borders as spaces of transition and play. How we can use these lines to empower our humanity rather than divide it.\nThe Border Ellipsis\nIn Europe, many of us take open borders for granted, or we did before the pandemic. The Schengen Agreement allows us to easily live between spaces or travel without any more than an ID card. It\u2019s not so different from the US where state borders are usually no more tangible than a sign (and a toll to pay on the highway). Any American can tell you there\u2019s a big difference between New Hampshire and Massachusetts or California and Nevada despite their shared permeable borders.\nBut culture and dialects blur more in the US. In Europe, we may cross an open border and change language and currency immediately. I live on the edge of three nations, in a city that is completely Swiss but also plays with the culture of its neighbours. It has made me acutely aware of the cultural exchanges that go on here, and the culture that is kept intact by the maintenance of a permeable border. In Basel, we are only ever a few kilometres from France or Germany. I have been awed by riding a tram to get cheaper groceries (as well as better bakery products) in France. One stop, people get on speaking mainly Swiss German. The next, a few hundred meters away, the doors open to the completely different tone and cadence of French.\nWe play in the ellipsis of the border to live freely, the way we want. Jacques Derrida most poignantly analyses this space of play in \u201cBefore the Law,\u201d a reading of Franz Kafka\u2019s parable. Physical thresholds and titles to written texts, just like national lines, give us a form of entry into a space where we can bring ideas together in meaningful ways. The sign \u2014 Benvenuto in Italia or simply green, white, and red stripes \u2014 allows us to take on a different persona as we enter. It tells us we can try out this way of living. This way of seeing the world.\nAll borders should be this way. We are lucky in the Schengen Area. Other borders are menacing and keep families apart. We have seen it in Mexico/USA and China/Hong Kong, in East/West Germany, in Israel/Palestine\u2026. How many people will die trying to get to another land? How many world leaders will continue to either fortify or, worse, push the extension of the border against the will of people who inhabit those spaces? It\u2019s not only Putin. It\u2019s not only the \u2018non-West.\u2019 In America, Trump was spending billions on a wall. Brexit\u2019s insistence on separatism not only keeps many people out but also stagnates the British who are trapped in. How strange for a country that has colonised the most places in the world. Have they not experienced the beauty of other cultures?\nBut we know it\u2019s not the people, the masses, who want this. Even those who voted for Brexit were often uninformed. In America, most people who want to build an expensive wall wrongly think that Mexicans are taking their jobs. And many Russians who support the current invasion are only seeing fake news. Even with the extreme suppression of free speech and press currently shaping the Russian narrative, only an estimated 58% support the war and more than 13,000 to date have been arrested for protesting.\nA refuge on the border, flying provincial and national flags.\nStraddling the Alps\nBack on my little perch on the mountaintop, I look out at the skiers before me. They come from all over, speak many languages, and often wear a piece of their nationhood on their jackets or hats. Often when I ski, I feel gratitude for being one with nature. But unless you are heli-skiing from an unoccupied mountain, you will also see humanity\u2019s marks. You will also experience culture.\nSkiing between Zermatt in Switzerland and Cervinia in Italy, sometimes back and forth within minutes, I can see and hear the differences clearly. I\u2019ve lived in both countries, so maybe it makes me more aware of these changes. They are visceral and immediate.\nItaly at first appears as a disappointment. In Zermatt, all the lifts are new and high-functioning, usually with leather seats and often a closed gondola to fight the cold temperatures at altitude. A mountain train and flashy cable car (the highest in Europe) round out the speedy system. In Italy, the first lift I take is slow. It\u2019s on orange plastic with no padding. As I look down, the seat next to me has been repaired with a makeshift screw. It stops several times on the way up. Nearby are relatively cheap J-bars and tow-ropes. Eventually I find a gondola with plastic windows so worn that photos are impossible.\nAnd then, I arrive suddenly at a newish fancy cable car to the top. The operator cranks up some club music: \u2018Here we f*cking go!\u2019. Helmets and hips are moving all over; nobody seems worried about that swaying they always warn you about. I recall one ride with music on the Swiss side. It was a similar looking large cable car, but with elevator-volume croons from the 1960s.\nThe trail signs are also different. The Italian ones are tiny and yellow with little information. The Swiss signs are filled with symbols of clarity: numbers and titles, lift designations and directions home.\nThere\u2019s also less snow on this side. It\u2019s been a warm February. Is it just unlucky? The way the sun hits? Or is it snowmaking capabilities? Or the way the trails were designed? A quick Google tells me yes, Italy is on the sunny side. This has perks, of course, too. And how much of culture is linked with luck of the place a people inhabit? Is it the weather that makes San Diego so relaxed and Boston so grumpy, so resilient?\nBut you can\u2019t tell too much from the open trails. I liked the feel of lodge, so I come back for lunch, my little Italy. I imagine myself living again in Milano as I did 15 years ago. The polenta and pitcher of wine remind me of trips to Bergamo (now infamous for hideous scenes during the pandemic). I pack my own snacks on the Swiss side. Lunch costs as much as a lift ticket and reservations are a must, at noon or two o\u2019clock. How do I know when I will stop to eat, where I will be? Do I have to stay for two hours to make it worth it rather than hit the slopes when I\u2019m done?\nI go to the toilet after I eat and open the door to a squatter. Memories of these toilets in nice restaurants and at monuments flood back to me. Mindfully, I step onto the metal footprints with my ski boots and pray that my stream will miss my pants. The ubiquitous toilets in Switzerland are always clean and white, well stocked with paper. Oh, looks like I\u2019m shaking dry as well, but at least I got to work out my quads a little more.\nDo you get what you pay for? Is it all just economics?\nThe Pandemic and collective trauma\nSomething else that\u2019s different at this border is the visibility of masks. While Switzerland has declared the end of the(ir) pandemic, Italy is acting more cautiously and still requires FFP2 masks indoors. Just prior to the altitude party in the Italian cable car, uniformed police were checking skiers for vaccine passports and correct face coverings. But it wasn\u2019t only a legal thing; the same party-going operator said permesso to move past me and berate a man hiding in the corner for not wearing his mask.\nIt\u2019s likely that there is a collective trauma from the pandemic in Northern Italy, where it was the epicentre of the virus in February 2020. These types of communal memories also create culture. Groups of people experience moments together and then respond, hopefully, through art as well as through science and technology. Although the whole world is experiencing the pandemic in some way, our individual and grouped experiences shape who we are.\nThe Swiss have been luckier. Here, in Zermatt, they show empathy and understanding of their neighbours. The ski area asks you to wear masks on lifts, although not necessarily FFP2. I guess they are trying to make the Italians feel more comfortable. Or maybe living near the Italians has given them some of their trauma or some of their perspective of the world.\nThe price of a meal or style of toilets are not really a big deal. But what I love about this space some nearly 4000 meters up in the sky, is that the laid back Italians and the punctual Swiss can coexist. That two languages can articulate the beauty of the snow. That we can all enjoy the coffee.\nI\u2019m back outside, looking around. People are eating, smoking, skiing. I don\u2019t see helicopters bringing couples to mountain peaks with fondue and roses. I don\u2019t hear large groups of British bankers. Who inhabits this space?\nMaybe I need to keep looking.\nA mountain by any other name would look as beautiful\nI stop looking at people and signs, instead returning to majestic natural beauty. I\u2019ve had a love affair with the Matterhorn this week. I took too many photos, finding different angles of light and positions from which to view it.\nThe Italians and Swiss have different names for this mountain; they see it from different angles. We\u2019re all sort of the same, but with cultural identity we can be human. We can find joy and meaning in different perspectives and artistic responses to places and experiences.\nCulture and turf war is as irrational as the gang fighting of the Montagues and Capulets. This invasion is not really about culture or land; it is about power. Foucault tells us power is everywhere. Its ubiquitous nature also means it is an illusion \u2014 to some extent. It is something that can be mined and used by those who persuade others of their power. Who is going to call Putin\u2019s bluff? Who is going to crush this fake power from fake narrative he has created?\nIf the mountain had no name, it would still exist, but humanity would not. Can\u2019t we all live in this beautiful world and create identities that we can share at their meeting points? Not only at national borders but also at the threshold of one\u2019s apartment or the entry to a classroom?\nBe Italian. Be Swiss. Be European. Be Ukrainian. Be Russian. Be a little of each. Go on holiday in Crimea. Visit your relatives in Moscow. Eat each other\u2019s food. Learn each other\u2019s languages. This is what most people want.\nThe invasion is not about reclaiming a culture as Putin claims; it is about erasing culture. Ukraine, he says, should be \u2018freed from the Nazis\u2019, whose fascist head is supposedly President Zelenski, Jewish descendent of Holocaust survivors.\nWhat does it all mean? I am no expert in warfare or economics or politics or Ukraine. But I can tell you that the idea of wiping away a culture is as good as death (and is usually accompanied by death, even genocide). If the idea is to destroy people\u2019s identities, then Putin has failed. Because the idea of being a Ukrainian is now boldly visible. And the idea of being an informed 21st Century Russian (protesters and outspoken expatriates as well as those protesting in the space of their minds only with fear for their children) is just as visible.\nSomebody wrote \u2018FK PUTIN\u2019 in the snow near the border, big enough for a plane to see. No groomer has erased it for a week despite the supposedly reserved nature of the Swiss.\nSwitzerland is suddenly no longer neutral, nor is it in NATO. What will Italy do for us if Putin (not Russia) invades? Will they replace their masks with weapons? Or make huge bowls of polenta al gorgonzola and share all their wine? Will they let us ski over this same border to safety?\nDuring the pandemic, we re-closed borders that had been made permeable. We restricted cultural exchange. And we did it all for good reason. But if we have learned anything, it should be that cultural identity is something to celebrate. Borders are places of meaning. And death is something that can hit us all, at any time, with just as much sadness whether we are a poor soldier or a world leader (as opined by Brandy L Schillace in GEN).\nWhile we are the ones alive, let us keep looking, both at the many types of people around us and at the natural world in which we are so lucky to inhabit.\nKathleen Waller is a novelist with a PhD in Comparative Literature. Her doctoral dissertation on the Apartment Ellipsis investigates the way immigrants\u2019 domestic borders assert or deny identity based on the host culture and law.

The old biblical symbol of knowledge/sin has morphed into the apple that adorns an iPhone. We enter its vortex of information and find\u2026violence, death, destruction, disease, breakups, deadlines\u2026we are no longer naive children of utopian bliss.\nSometimes this digital trip doesn\u2019t seem bad at all, funny or joyful or uplifting. The other night, I had the ping of a NYT notification (one of the few I still receive). It was news of the welcome confirmation of Ketanji Brown Jackson as our new supreme court justice. Then, I went on Instagram and found out an old friend far away is happily pregnant. There\u2019s loads of good news online, but lately, the things that seem important to stay updated on are depressing: climate change, Ukraine, January 6 non-consequences, Mali, COVID, Hong Kong\u2026\nOf course, ignorance is an even worse option. Is it possible to structure our knowledge intake and trust certain sources to have a good understanding of the world without going crazy and without taking on more stress? Can we learn just enough of the bad that helps us to be better human beings?\nBecause, from an ethical point of view, if I think of the universal good and a better world\u2026I do not want billions of people sitting around feeling like the world is going to end and crying for people dying in other countries. Yes, a little crying is good and a little understanding of doom (climate, nuclear war, microchips in our brain, etc.) is very important, but too much means we all just shut down. And if we shut down, some ambitious and less empathetic and forward thinking people take control of our collective future.\nStaying sane\nTo use foresight and to tackle the world\u2019s problems one individual at a time, we must be of sane mind. We must also understand the problems and empathize enough that we want to give money to organizations that help, offer up our homes to those in need when we can, and do jobs that help shape a better future (among other types of action). We also want to share kindness and love to others \u2014 friends, neighbors, people we encounter at the grocery store \u2014 and raise kids that do the same.\nParadoxically, an extract from an essay by Rolf Dobelli appears in The Guardian called: \u201cNews is bad for you \u2014 and giving up reading it will make you happier.\u201d He shows concrete examples and research of how consuming a great amount of news does not make us smarter and causes us to focus on the wrong things. But Dobelli is not telling us to give up on truth; he tells us \u201c[s]ociety needs journalism.\u201d Journalists who seek the abstract truth and share important stories rather than sensational ones as well as investigating crimes or the impact of political decisions are helping individuals. They can also feature good in society, inspiring others to do the same or articulating where people can find help. Sometimes simply sharing a narrative is an act of good that people can relate to or reflect on. However, Dobelli has given up non-journalistic news and claims it has a drastic benefit to his mental health.\nOne way I avoid the doom scroll of news is by utilizing the Quartz Daily Brief, which I discuss in Read Less but Read Better in this publication. But it\u2019s not easy. Although most of my notifications are switched off, it seems necessary to know if something big happens. And when there\u2019s an evolving tragedy, like the war in Ukraine, my anxiety tells me to check and see \u2014 to see if it might be getting better, to try to understand, to witness.\nThe situation in Ukraine has been exposed largely through people on the ground documenting humanitarian crises and potential war crimes. In fact, the wonderful citizen journalism, much of it on this website as well as on TikTok, Instagram, reprinted in world news organizations\u2026may be having a positive impact on both helping Ukrainians and preventing wars in the future. It is \u2018good\u2019 to expose these crimes and document people\u2019s stories, especially when research shows it actually helps the anti-war effort, but it\u2019s also hugely psychologically damaging (obviously much more so for the people actually bearing witness or personally affected). I\u2019m not saying don\u2019t do it. I\u2019m just saying, maybe we need to be better at filtering the information (often through images) and determining where/when/how we view it.\nAn image-centric world\nSocial media can impact our mental health in many ways; we should see and understand the truth, but often what we see has also been warped or falsified in some way. (Generic images can be just as bad.) We are bombarded not only with advertisements meant to appeal to some vulnerable parts of our brains but also images meant to make us admire someone (and perhaps feel envious) or feel empathy for their hardships. Other times they are meant to insight anger at a wrong or tears from a touching personal moment. The image-rich world of social media can be an overwhelming emotional experience.\nWe now gain a huge amount of our knowledge through images, and that\u2019s not all bad. Many people learn and retain information better through images. But because we are likely to believe what we see, digital images (which may be altered or out of context) may be contributing to a post-truth world.\nPhoto by Alexandra Nicolae on Unsplash\nIs the problem the images? In our image-centric world, is there a different impact on our brains? Do we think emotionally instead of rationally when we understand \u2018the news\u2019 in this way? Asking for help with images of a problem appeals to emotions and should get a better response. But why can\u2019t we be trusted to make good decisions with rational thought, i.e. through an understanding via language, especially the written word that can be more carefully sourced and reflected upon?\nOthers have tried to understand the bombardment of war images on an ethical and psychological level, to the viewer, initial photographer, and victim(s). One article in Time Magazine by Photography and Human Rights professor Fred Ritchin discusses \u201cWhy Violent News Images Matter\u201d without a clear conclusion. He investigates both the idea that there is a good moral purpose in showing people tragedies, so that we may fight for a better world, and the research showing these images can be psychologically damaging. The answer is somewhere in between.\nHegelian hope\nThrough online texts, we can have discussions and checks and balances of information in comments or through linking a text to our own opinion for others to form their own ideas from several sources. If we don\u2019t fall for the trap of information that is automatically funnelled toward our preferences and actually seek out different perspectives through hashtags and varieties of news sources, we can find something closer to the truth. Hegelian dialectics teaches us that moving between opposing views and looking for different angles will help us find the best way forward. Hegel believes that all world problems will eventually be sorted in this way. The caveat is that we have to be open to hearing/seeing/reading these opposing views.\nRutger Bregman\u2019s book Humankind: A Hopeful History posits that we live in a time that is infinitely better than the past, despite current wars, power-hungry leaders, and climate change. He uses current research, historical anecdotes, literature, and human psychology to articulate his point in an interesting weave of chapters that can also be stand alone essays. At the start he tells us: \u201cThis book is about a radical idea\u2026.That most people, deep down, are pretty decent.\u201d I recall my philosophy teacher in college who asked us all: When throughout history would you most want to live? Most of us romanticized different time periods through art and chose the Roaring Twenties or the Revolutionary Sixties or the Beautiful Renaissance. He said: As far in the future as possible. Things will be better then. He had a strong belief and trust in the goodness of humanity.\nThis idea goes back to my initial idea in this article; in order to develop and grow as a world, we as individuals need to be kept happy, healthy, and well looked after. We need to help people have their basic human rights as well as kindness; this is both in effect to allow individuals a good life and to ensure that the world moves in a positive direction. Of course, to do this, we also can\u2019t be ignorant. We have to understand other people\u2019s problems in order to share kindness and love. But we also have to look after the threshold where an individual can get too overwhelmed to actually do good in helping others.\nSo what about climate change? Can we really do anything to help when our leaders aren\u2019t taking the initiatives we want them to? Can we beat the UN\u2019s recent warning that it\u2019s \u2018now or never\u2019?\nRecently on a train trip to Paris, I had a conversation with my friend who is a green energy specialist, Alki Delichatsios, about what we can do as individuals to fight climate change. When she hears about something individuals can do to help, she investigates the efficacy and impact. After I told her how hot her Parisian hair always is, she wondered aloud: is it worth only washing her hair once a week to help reduce waste? Call me vain, but I was horrified she would tell me it\u2019s necessary. She thinks bar shampoo without packaging could be her answer. All her methods of helping the environment work synchronously to offset her impact; she takes a train (instead of a plane) from Paris to Portugal and she conducts research and consults with companies to make big impacts of change. I can keep taking the train and forget about our idea to buy a car next year. I can put a solar panel on my roof (if I were to own a house\u2026). I can live in an urban setting with better use of resources, including a smaller home and more community sharing. I can use bar shampoo (still not sure about that\u2026recs, please).\nIt\u2019s about balance and doing the best we can. It\u2019s also about getting leaders to make bigger scale changes that represent what most individuals want. This is about an educated understanding rather than a fearful response either to water rising and pollution becoming unbearable or to a life without travel and simple luxuries we have learned to love.\nFearful, but grateful\nI still remember the speech from my brother\u2019s college graduation about 15 years ago. The speaker discussed what he saw as the greatest human achievement since WWII: that we had not used the atom bomb again. We knew it was a possible weapon; we had all seen its power. And yet, even with other wars and the tensions of the Cold War, nobody had used it. He found it remarkable and a testament to humanity\u2019s goodness and rationality. I hope we can still say the same for a long time\u2026forever. I\u2019d rather die under an asteroid and still believe in the goodness of humanity.\nA recent article in The New York Times dealt with these fears we currently have that it\u2019s all just going to end due to the stupidity of man. \u201cAn Age of Existential Uncertainty\u201d by in-house opinion columnist Charles M. Blow recalls nuclear attack drills at school. He claims we are returning to a mindset of an uncertain future (though he notes the future is always uncertain). Blow is a wonderful columnist, dealing often with the political and cultural in articulate and well informed ways. Listening to writers like him can help us all understand the world, and he has articulated the burden we all feel of being well-informed. No doubt he has seen all of the amazing coverage by the NYT of Ukraine\u2019s disaster, which continues to be verified in new methods. He doesn\u2019t leave much hope in his article; I think he is simply being honest without a remedy. This is unusual for him. Perhaps the antidote to this dread is mindset, is selecting what we allow our eyes to consume, and in electing world leaders that will listen to the people\u2026hoping things will (continue to) change for the better. Still, it\u2019s not easy to sit and wait for it.\nOften we forget to look at what\u2019s good or what we have achieved in the face of difficulty. Sadly, it\u2019s easier to remember our traumas than happy memories. I try to combat this many days before bed or after a working session. It\u2019s easy to think about what we still need to do or what went wrong or an uncomfortable situation. Often, if I stop to think of what I have achieved or my \u2018top three\u2019 moments of the day\u2026my mind is blown by how great the day can actually be. For me, it helps to keep anxiety at bay.\nMaybe some will say it\u2019s actually The End of the World\u2026and I feel stupidly fine. I guess all we can do is our best. Try to help it not be the end of the world, try to not give up hope. If we can learn carefully, consider the knowledge we gain and our thoughts in reflection, and then sometimes simply live, we will be winning. Because by cooking good food, reading a great novel, taking a beautiful walk, playing with a child, or dancing without reservation we are slowly making the world better.\nKathleen Waller is a novelist with a PhD in Comparative Literature.

Most people are still home with their young children or sleeping late. Others are in their mountain homes already on the ski slopes. The rest are scattered.\nI make my way to a cafe some thirty-five minutes away be foot. The few vermin of the city are still out prowling. They are more visible without the cloak of the day, made more colourful against closed store fronts.\nThis place is small and yet on the frontier of three countries. It is on the map now. A global superpower \u2014 biotech and Art Basel. What a combination. A paradox we see within families, culture, skyline.\nThe Roche towers have grown over the year.

Will people just speak English because it is easier, even if they speak it badly or without any (beautiful) discernible accent?\nLet us allow Gaelic and Swiss German, but also English and French and German and Italian. But let us not push it as something necessary or good.\nI have lived here a year.\nHow is that even possible? The thought enters my brain as I move over the bridge I trespassed at least twice a day for the first six months. Lockdown. Not working. Young child. We walked and walked and walked.

Although others mock him during the Salem witch trials, he is the only government or church figure (well, the same as the early colony of Massachusetts was a theocracy) who can really see the truth, the grey area. So although there is some mockery of the way he carries these appendages of knowledge, perhaps studying them or reflecting on them has made him wiser. Rather than quote the texts, he seems to be reminded that he has done the reading as well as the thinking that follows.\nI love to read, and I love to read many kinds of books as well as many lengths of books. Sometimes a short novel is exquisitely filled with beauty and truth. Sometimes I want to read something on a plane that I know I can finish by landing. But there is a certain commitment of the undertaking of a 500+ page book that feels both literally and figuratively weighty in a way that helps me to grow.\nWe all have to choose how we use our time. As readers, we have to carefully select where our reading time goes (as I discuss in an article for Better Humans). Choosing large books takes away from the Reading Challenge count on Goodreads or simply the other books waiting on our shelves. Somehow, the big book has to be worth it.\nOf course, some big books don\u2019t take that long to read at all. Stephen King page-turners can be read in the manner of binge-watching television series (I\u2019m not commenting on the quality here, merely the ease of continuing to read when your eyelids are heavy). This joy of escape simply lasts longer because of the page count. On the other hand, some big books you might find you read only sections of. It could be a collection of stories or essays in which you read randomly at moments that grab you. Or, it could be a biography or other non-fiction text in which you selectively use the index to find the parts you are interested in.\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with any of that. But I still enjoy the occasional commitment to a tome in full, read slowly with a pen in hand. This immersive experience helps me go deeper with ideas and to truly consider the range of the author\u2019s philosophical process. Sometimes I drop all the other books I\u2019m simultaneously reading. Other times, I circle back to the book once a week or even once a month.\nThere\u2019s no right way to read a tome just as there\u2019s no right way to read. There are also plenty that I\u2019ve begun only to set aside, not wanting to give that much time to the prose or ideas I had encountered thus far. I\u2019ll share eight books that have worked for me in this way.\nStalagmite of tomes to read [photo by the author, 2022]\nNovels\nReading a big novel can help us understand more perspectives or give a deeper understanding of context and culture. I found these two novels to be concisely large; no words were wasted to tell us more about the world the way the author imagined it. Although I must also give a special shout out to a few others: Invisible Man (Ralph Ellison), War and Peace (Leo Tolstoy), Crime and Punishment (Fyodor Dostoyevsky), and any novel by Jonathan Franzen or Haruki Murakami.\nMoby Dick by Herman Melville (1851)\nWhen I took a class on Melville in grad school, our professor forced us to read his entire oeuvre before diving into Moby Dick. He told us we couldn\u2019t really call it a novel; it was a \u2018book,\u2019 and that book could only be understood through the many sublayers of Melville\u2019s writing. He meant that a lot of the chapters became philosophy or reflection on the laws of ships or word paintings or scientific observations. Melville used his ship as a microcosmic study of humanity\u2019s fears and desires while somehow including the whales\u2019 \u2018phrenological characteristics\u2019 (Chapter 79). However, it\u2019s also a classic tale of a journey and one that is close to my roots in Massachusetts.\nA Strangeness in My Mind by Orhan Pamuk (2014; translation from the Turkish by Eki Oklap, 2015)\nPamuk\u2019s stories take us viscerally to Turkey, painting pictures of characters and places that last with us a long time. Through history, character perspectives, and poignant highs and lows, Pamuk also takes us on a journey on the streets of Istanbul. There are big questions about history, fate, and even the meaning of life. Ultimately, it\u2019s also a love story as well as the way love is a part of our culture, destiny, and worldview.\nBig biographies\nBiographies can feel unnecessarily weighty with facts upon facts that we don\u2019t always want to know about. But if these are written as a story or with more attention to the way the facts come together, it can be an amazing immersive experience. Anybody\u2019s life is interesting if we listen carefully enough. The way these authors have chosen to curate these details has made me want to read even more of the allusions. Since each is about an author as well, I ended the book with a longer reading list of plays, novels, and poetry to soon encounter.\nBurning Boy by Paul Auster (2022)\nI devour Auster\u2019s novels and memoirs because of their fresh characters and philosophical investigations. His recent novel \u2014 4321 \u2014 could easily go in the novel category above. I was really intrigued by this pandemic project about Stephen Crane that was supposed to be 150 pages and ended up as 800. Auster tells The Guardian:\nIt\u2019s an enormous book, I know. For a life that was that short, it\u2019s pretty strange that I should have written so much. But it\u2019s not just a biography, it\u2019s also a reading of his work: it\u2019s about evenly split between the two.\nAuster\u2019s prose is heavy with information but likewise written in such a poetic way that it feels lovely to linger on the words that begin to form quickly into ideas. Like many other Americans in my generation, I did not come across Crane in high school, and it\u2019s interesting to read why Auster thinks I was cheated. Now to continue the ideas, I\u2019ve got to read at least The Red Badge of Courage. It\u2019s fun when a book pushes you forward with your knowledge journey.\nTom Stoppard: A Life by Hermione Lee (2021)\nIn a similar way, Lee\u2019s biography of Tom Stoppard makes me want to read the plays of his I have not. She is famous for her beautiful biographies (including that on Virginia Woolf) but had never completed one about a living subject. She includes discussion at the end that perhaps due to the fact that Stoppard will read the book, it might not be as truthful as the others. However, at the same time, his personal additions and interviews have helped her to create a fuller picture, including the way he worked with Stephen Spielberg (uncredited) on several films. We learn about many difficult personal situations, but for me, it was the way the plays were created that really stood out. I enjoyed these passages so much that I will go back to them when I get around to the other plays. In fact, the notion that he is at once so marvellous and so prone to the human condition is what makes him a great storyteller.\nEpic poetry\nReading in verse can sometimes feel like a huge undertaking. For that reason, even if you go well under the 500 page mark, I would call them tomes. I still have Dante sitting on my shelf. I was hoping to go back to my latent Italian to do a bilingual reading. Maybe it\u2019s something I shouldn\u2019t wait for. Maybe I\u2019ll just dive into sections when I feel like it. These other texts in verse, I\u2019ve not only read but enjoyed teaching to students even though the thought of reading these once scared the hell out of me.\nParadise Lost by John Milton (1667)\nSpeaking of hell, this is where we spend a lot of the time in Milton\u2019s most famous work. As the story goes, he wrote it blind, memorising verses at night to dictate them to his scribe. That alone first enticed me on reading it in college. Although the words weave through verse and Biblical allusions (of course), even my high school students have loved the subversive nature of the characterisation of God and Satan as an intertextual connection to Frankenstein. Satan is ultimately a fool, tricked by his own hubris, and the pictures painted of hell and Eden are remarkable. What a great story for us all, no matter our religious beliefs.\nThe Odyssey by Homer (8th Century BCE, translated from the Ancient Greek by Robert Fagles, 1996)\nWe were asked to read this book as summer reading before the first year of university began. I did love reading at that time, but it felt like pretty hard work to get through this book in the summer after my high school graduation. The main reason we were asked to read it is because Fagles was going to give a talk during our Orientation week. Well, he changed it all around for me. The way he recited both the Greek and his translation made me realize this was a more familiar tale than it first seemed. Take this open sharing of emotion by father and son (Book 16, lines 242\u20135):\nAt that / Odysseus sat down again, and Telemachus threw his arms / around his great father, sobbing uncontrollably / as the deep desire for tears welled up in both.\nI realized after Fagles visited that this was something that should be read aloud and celebrated as an investigation of humanity. The family dynamics, worlds of death and the living, and nature of the prophecies are fantastically and simultaneously straightforward and compelling.\nPhilosophical journeys\nI guess any of the books above would also be philosophical journeys. If one reads a brief philosophical manifesto, it is hard to truly understand the idea. Through these longer texts of worked example (sometimes only in metaphor) we are forced to take longer with the ideas and try them out in our own minds. As we read the books for weeks if not months, our realities are interpreted through the perspectives of the authors. I also relish Jacques Derrida and Slavoj \u017di\u017eek in this category. They move into ontology as well as the arts and political in really fascinating ways.\nThe Arcades Project by Walter Benjamin (1982, translated from the German by Howard Eiland and Kevin McLaughlin, 1999)\nThis posthumously published book of observations in and on Paris by Benjamin was written from 1927\u201340 just before the German Occupation. It captures an architecturally changing Paris, both giving aesthetic credence to the city and criticizing the lack of care for the poor as well as sometimes destroying buildings in favor of Modernity (for Modernity\u2019s sake). The Arcades are an undercover shopping area that bring together many aspects of the city\u2019s culture. Benjamin spends a lot of time also looking at Baudelaire\u2019s poetry (and his understanding of the city streets as a fl\u00e2neur). He writes his own reflections woven with those of the poet, of architects, of historians, cultural critics\u2026the book is not linear. One must expect to be bombarded with images and ideas and to make sense of them for yourself.\nCinema 1 & Cinema 2 by Gilles Deleuze (1983, 1985)\nThese two books about film (but philosophical in nature) translate into: The Movement Image (1) and The Time Image (2). They will help you think about film in relation to philosophy and real life; they will help you think about life as a film. He sees cinema as the perfect storm of art: visual, moving, and filled with words. Although it seems limitless, he helps to define key methods of creating the art and thinking about the art.\nWhat\u2019s next?\nSelecting and purchasing or borrowing your next big book can be a lot of the fun. Research into which authors discuss the ideas or culture you\u2019re currently interested in. Find recommendations from people who share your reading preferences. Spend ages roaming in a library or bookshop, like the Livraria Lello in Lisbon or Concord Bookshop in Massachusetts.\nI\u2019ve got a project to read Marcel Proust\u2019s Remembrance of Things Past and bought a copy of all the smaller books in one in a Parisian bookshop last autumn. Right now, it\u2019s just a decoration, but when the mood strikes me I\u2019ll start, maybe slowly\u2026maybe quickly\u2026maybe I\u2019ll read every single word\u2026maybe I\u2019ll skip entire books. When it\u2019s your own project, you choose how you do it. Sometimes even just having these monsters waiting for us on our shelves, looming down at us, reminds us humbly of the knowledge we don\u2019t have; as Umberto Eco says, this is our antilibrary that pushes us forward.\nI would never throw myself into a huge book if the moment didn\u2019t seem right. You\u2019ve got to be ready to face it, excited to devour the language, and intrigued to reflect on what it means to you. Or I guess essentially, you just have to do it when you want to. What other reason could there be?\nKathleen Waller is a novelist with a PhD in Comparative Literature.

I wanted the experience to feel fluid. I wanted to create something that users could move through without friction or boundaries. I wanted to bring people closer to their North Stars with speed and elegance.\nIn the months that followed, I devoured countless volumes of HCI literature while pivoting from one prototype to the next. I tried everything from a \u201csmart-fidget-ring\u201d concept that doubled as a universal remote, to wondering if something as simple as a rubber-band could serve as an interface. Although I was surprised that something so illogical could inspire so many avenues for exploration, nothing seemed to capture the feeling I had described in my poetic manifesto.\nMessy, manic making. Bottom left sketch was done by my friend Marisa Lu during a particularly productive phone call exploring the mental model of \u201cflows\u201d\nMy breakthrough came when I realized that I had been asking all the wrong questions. I had spent months trying to invent new ways to navigate existing systems \u2014 but what if those systems were fundamentally flawed? What if the experience of Mercury required a radical re-invention of everything I had been taking for granted?\nWhy?\nIn my article titled \u201cThe Desktop Metaphor Must Die,\u201d I described some fundamental issues with the Desktop metaphor and App Sandboxes. My personal investment in the future of computation goes much deeper than simply craving a better experience for experience\u2019s sake.\nMercury is designed, first and foremost, to be an experience inclusive of people with limited executive function and cognitive load. People living with ASD, ADHD, and other neurological differences who are frequently overwhelmed by the flood of sensory information we have all come to expect in conventional operating systems.\nPeople like me.\nDesktop or dumpster? You decide. (Image courtesy of my dear friend Lindo)\nResearch has shown that people with limited executive function find it more difficult to get things done when they are not in flow-state. We are also more susceptible to interruptions and interstitial friction. These interruptions include everything from the obvious (Notifications, Alerts, etc) to the not-so-obvious (Photoshop asking you to name your file AND choose where it will be saved). It is truly unfortunate that friction has come to be accepted as an unavoidable part of everyday computing.\nFor people who already have trouble controlling their locus of attention, the context switching required to deal with these interruptions can be an incredibly draining experience that could take up to 15 minutes. For comparison\u2019s sake, the average neurotypical person is usually able to switch gears in under 10 seconds.\nThis is why the inherent modality of Applications and Windowing environments is particularly frustrating to me. And while I understand that for some people, the desktop metaphor is not broken enough to require any fixing (where\u2019s the data?, they ask), I stand by my words and my truth.\nWhy is this normal? Why should I have to expend my limited cognitive energy finessing\u2026this?\nOn that note, let\u2019s dive into what Mercury actually is.\nMercury is\u2026\n1. Fluid\nInstead of asking people to modify their thoughts and actions around the arbitrary sandboxes of Apps, Mercury responds fluidly to the intentions of its user, alleviating the risk of interstitial friction that all multi-tool workflows carry.\n2. Focused\nThe clutter we take for granted in today\u2019s operating systems can be overwhelming, especially for folks sensitive to stimulation. Mercury is respectful of limited bandwidths and attention spans, and rejects the idea of \u201cnotification driven engagement.\u201d Information will not be pushed to the user unless they intentionally ask for it. Mercury\u2019s intention-as-context architecture vaccinates the user against the unintentional consumption of information.\n3. Familiar\nMercury introduces new ideas and metaphors through familiar interaction patterns on an existing device: Mercury is designed for multi-touch tablets with keyboard support \u2014 a category often overlooked as awkward hybrids straddling two worlds. Mercury leans into the playfulness afforded by multi-touch and the efficiency made possible by the keyboard.\nMercury re-imagines the operating system as a fluid experience driven by human intent.\nThis is Mercury.\n\nArchitecture\n\nOn the atomic level, Mercury is comprised of Modules. Modules are combinations of content and actions assembled based on user intent.\n\nUsers can create new modules that live adjacent to the starting module. A horizontal row of Modules is called a Flow. This is true even if there is only one module in the entire row.\n\nA Space is a contextual grouping of the different flows required to fulfill an overarching intent. For example, if a user declares a \u201cReview Inbox\u201d space, Mercury will populate it automatically with flows containing the unread messages that the user will need to read in order to fulfill their intention of reviewing their Inbox.\n\nA Space is generated every time a user declares an intention from the empty state, and is generally named after said intention. Almost every interaction in Mercury takes place within a Space.\nModules\n\nModules are the building blocks of Mercury. They are defined using combinations of nouns (items), verbs (actions) and modifiers.\nModules generated by the system employ a Noun-Verb construction because it is assumed that the content of the module will dictate the actions the user will intend to take (if any).\n\nUser-defined Modules can certainly follow the Noun-Verb model described above. However, Verb-Noun construction is also supported so that users can ask for Modules colloquially. This use case will be especially common when Voice input is used.\n\nNote that Mercury will not produce a Module from a definition that does not specify a Noun (e.g. \u201cPlay\u2026\u201d). Instead, it will suggest different nouns to complete the definition.\nThe Power of Locus\nUsers can redefine Modules at any time using its Locus (the action bar). Locus combines the power of a Command-Line Interface with the convenience of Natural Language Processing and the discoverability of GUI.\nLocus recognizes complete sentences as Actions, and can even perform tasks that involve multiple steps. Just activate the Locus by tapping on it, or by toggling the Command key. As you type, Locus will offer context-specific suggestions to help you discover its capabilities.\nUsers can denote an array by using commas.\nStandardized Shortcuts\nIn conventional operating systems, keyboard shortcuts are hard to remember and a nuisance to find. Furthermore, different Apps may require different shortcuts for the same function.\nIn Mercury, shortcuts are standardized through Locus. To see which ones are available, simply press and hold the Command key. Without letting go of Command, start typing to progressively filter the list of actions down to the one you want.\n\nResponsive Modules\nContextual modifiers (like conditional statements) can help automate more nuanced tasks on demand, without the need to leave the current context.\n\nSimultaneous Modules\nModules are able to exist in multiple Flows and Spaces simultaneously if the user chooses to create Mirrors. Mirroring is fundamental to the architecture of Mercury, as it ensures that all items and actions are immediately reachable regardless of what Space (or context) the user is currently in. For example, mirrors of an email from your professor can exist in your Inbox Space and your Coursework Space at the same time.\nFlows\nIn conventional App-driven operating systems, functions are segregated within different Apps. The process of moving from App to App generates friction that takes you out of flow, and distracts you from your intentions.\nMercury is designed to help you enter and stay in flow. If you want to perform an action while leaving your current module untouched, you can generate a new module by tapping the Plus bubble adjacent to your current module, or by pressing the Tab key on your keyboard.\nAn empty Module will be populated by actions and items Mercury thinks you may need given your context.\nYou can also use continuous gestural input to generate Modules without diverting your attention from the content you\u2019re engaged in. Simply highlight a chunk of text to get started. An empty Module containing contextual suggestions will greet you where your finger left off so that you can keep the momentum going.\n\nSpaces\nEverything you do in Mercury is organized within Spaces. Spaces can be created from scratch, built on top of a Blueprint (template Spaces for common contexts and workflows), or generated for you by Mercury.\nA swipe up from the home screen reveals your chronological journey through time and, ahem, Space. Can\u2019t remember what you worked on last Thursday? Just find it in the Timeline. Want to reflect on the amount of time you spent Tweeting about Game of Thrones this weekend? To the Timeline we go.\n\nEntering a Space from the Timeline feels like zooming into a different dimension. The interface fades into the distance so you can focus on getting into flow. While inside a Space, you will receive no notifications unless you intentionally specify your availability in the Rules of the Space. Nothing stands in between you and your intentions.\n\nWithin a Space, flows represent the necessary steps that need to be taken in order to accomplish the intention of the Space. The \u201cReview Inbox\u201d intention, for example, includes all unread mail messages as well as incoming direct messages aggregated from different, unrelated services. In a conventional OS, one would have had to open multiple browser tabs or Applications in order to accomplish the same intention of \u201cReview Inbox.\u201d\nBy isolating services from their wider ecosystems, Mercury helps prevent potential avenues for distraction and unintentional content consumption.\n\nYour Space, Your Rules\nThe pinch gesture reveals a birds-eye view of every module inside the space, as well as the rules and collaborators that define how the space is generated.\n\n\nArtificial Collaborators\nIn a speculative future without Apps, corporations can continue to offer services through AI assistants. Adding these assistants into a spaces will add service-specific funtionality to the Modules in that space. For example, you may enlist the help of several Virtual Shopping Assistants on your quest to find the perfect pair of kicks.\n\nYou can ask Collaborators to generate modules automatically, or restrict their activity based on context. Collaborators will not have access to any information outside of the modules directly affected by their input. The sandboxing of Collaborators within Spaces protects your privacy while preserving intentional access to services you may rely on.\nGet Together\nPlan a trip to Vegas. Watch BLACKPINK\u2019s comeback with your fandom. Share documents, images, and work collaboratively in real time by inviting others to join one of your Spaces.\nYou could even give your secretary permission to add and remove items from your Inbox \u2014 without sharing a single password.\nArt Direction\nMercury\u2019s visual identity fuses the rational structures of Western Modernist design with the East Asian instinct to seek tranquility in chaos.\nFog\nKiri (\u9727), Japanese for \u201cfog,\u201d is the name of Mercury\u2019s visual manifestation. Kiri takes a judicious approach to contrast \u2014 bringing clarity only where it is needed, while obfuscating extraneous noise under a soft mist.\nChoreography\nMotion is used throughout Mercury to maintain spatial consistency and to guide the user\u2019s locus of attention from one module to the next. Mercury\u2019s choreography was inspired by the Daoist Way of inexertion; the interface moves without resistance to human input before easing into the equilibrium of stillness.\nTypography\nMercury emphasizes contrast in type size to reinforce information hierarchy and spatial consistency. The world of Mercury is set exclusively in S\u00f6hne by Klim Type Foundry, a type family exuding elegance and softness, while remaining uncompromising on clarity.\nWhere there\u2019s light\u2026\nKiri retreats into the shadows when night falls. Modules are backlit with a sublime incandesence inspired by the ethereal glow of moonlight.\nYou know I would never pass on a chance to design a dark mode ;)\nWhat\u2018s Next?\nThe one thing that has become blindingly clear to me throughout this nine month process is how absurdly foolish I was in believing I could go about doing this alone. This particular line of inquiry is so ambiguous, so reliant on abstract ideas and metaphors that I found myself digging rabbit holes for weeks and weeks only to lose my way in their murky depths.\nIn fact, almost all of the defining moments of Mercury have been a product of inviting the brilliance of others into my isolation chamber for feedback or collaboration. The feeling of bouncing ideas off exponential collaborators and working towards a shared North Star is addictive; all I can think about is how much I want to do this for the rest of my life.\nAnd that is exactly what I intend to do.\nI will be graduating from my BFA program at RISD in under a week, and my current plan is to travel to the West Coast in search of exponential collaborators and cybernetic thinkers who are also passionate about exploring this domaine. And if I can\u2019t find a team, I intend on building one.\nThere are so many questions I still need to answer, so many ambiguities I need to explore, and so many loopholes I need to reexamine. Universal undo/redo is so needed, yet strangely absent in almost all operating systems today (Shake to undo is not a viable replacement).\nAnd neither is my shameless rip off of Raskin\u2019s Canon Cat keyboard.\nAnd what about screens as a whole? Is the future of computation really just sliding fingers around slabs of glass?\nInstead of trying to resist the crushing gravity of curiosity, I am choosing to commit myself to a life time of cybernetic thinking, question-asking, and trouble-making. Hopefully, I won\u2019t be alone.\nSo, what\u2019s next? I have no clue.\nAll I know is that I must keep going.\nYour\u2019s truly,\nJason Yuan\nHumane Interface Designer and Advocate\nCreator of Mercury OS\nTwitter | Instagram | Website | Email\nAcknowledgements\nMercury would not have been possible without the generous feedback and encouragement from my wonderful peers, mentors, and friends.\nMy most heartfelt thank you\u2019s to Danny Trinh, Phill Ryu, Thomas Buffet, Mark Laughlin, Dandan Luo, Katie McIntyre, Jonathan Lee, Bob Burrough, Ed Kim, Marc Reisen, Ja Yoon Lee, Advait Kalakkad, Evan Rodgers, Gabby Widjaja, Cameron Burgess, Sharon Wei, Laurent Del Rey, Newar Choukeir, Victoria Wang, Aiden Fisher, Alex Schneidman, Devin Fan, Mac Wang, Eliza Chen, Sumaia Masoom, Theia Flynn, James Goggin, Sofia Soto, Evelyn Ma, Jennifer Joung, Vivian Wang, Lucas Ochoa, Kristina Selinski, SueSan Chen, and Gray Crawford.\nSpecial thanks to:\nMarisa Lu for bringing brilliance to the darkest tunnels of this journey,\nJodi Leo for keeping me afloat and for making the world feel less alone,\nPaul Soulellis for your guidance and unwavering faith,\nLindsey Weiss for your profound insights and for siblinghood,\nKris Sowersby for trusting me with bringing your characters to life.\nPam Daniels and Brandon Williams for introducing me to the world of design,\nDavid Catlin and TBD for the gift of storytelling and the strength to speak up,\nAnd to Dennis Jin for being the epitome of an exponential collaborator. \nFor helping shoulder the weight of Mercury, for your technical expertise, and for all the hours you poured into this.

What do I do?) feels especially welcome. I don\u2019t need a reason to pick up my phone because I know I\u2019ll find a reason the instant my screen turns on. I don\u2019t need to think, I don\u2019t need to decide\u2014 all I have to do is scroll.\nIt\u2019s kind of wonderful\u2026 in theory.\nThe luxury of not having to make any decisions is also a curse. Because decision making is intentionally left out of the typical social feed experience (\u2026at least for now), we have very little control over what goes into our feeds other than the people we choose to follow (or friend). And even then, we are still at the mercy of the all-mighty algorithms that are constantly trying to predict what (ads) we might want to see next.\nAnd so, even though we live so much of our lives on feeds now, it often feels like the feeds are the ones feeding on us. We know now that the unregulated use of persuasive technology in the context of social media feeds has helped usher in an age of addiction, surveillance capitalism, techno-fascism, and (newly emboldened movements of) white supremacy. Given everything that\u2019s happened, it\u2019s no surprise that the feed now carries a somewhat negative connotation \u2014 evoking images of gluttonous consumption and, to some, a lack of discipline.\n\u201cThe best minds of my generation are thinking about how to make people click ads\u201d \u2014 Jeffrey Hammerbacher\nDespite all of social media\u2019s sins, I am against \u201cScreenTime\u201d style interventions. Asking people to abstain from social media works about as well as asking teenagers to abstain from sex \u2014 it\u2019s just not going to happen, and it places the responsibility (and shame!) on the wrong folks.\nInstead, I\u2019m interested in looking at interventions that take place at the paradigm level. There\u2019s obviously something about feeds that human beings are drawn to\u2026 what if we could reinvent the feed as a place that makes space for human intent and self-fulfillment, without losing the mechanisms that make Feeds special in the first place?\nEarly Concepts\nAt some point in the past year, I came to the realization that Mercury OS, the speculative operating systems prototype I released in 2019, boiled down to intelligently assembled feeds of modular interfaces. Sensing an opportunity, I modified the concept into something more realistic \u2014 a to-do list application that generates a feed of interactive modules based on your tasks.\nLook familiar?\nHowever, after a few months of prototyping, I came to realize that a feed filled only with the promise of \u201cmore work\u201d is a feed I will never return to. It\u2019s the same reason why todo lists never worked for me \u2014 I have no interest in looking at a list consisting only of things I don\u2019t want to do. (If I wanted to do something, I would have done it already so it wouldn\u2019t be on the bloody list!)\nThere was something missing. A sense of reward. A dopamine hit. A \u2014\nAnd that\u2019s when it hit me.\nSocial media feeds like Twitter are explicitly designed to give people feelings of reward and accomplishment. What if, instead of creating a brand new feed to be productive in, we simply brought productive moments\u2026 into social feeds?\nEnter Hijack Your Feed.\nIntroducing Hijack Your Feed\nA project in collaboration with Omar Rizwan and Jeff Dlouhy\n\nHijack Your Feed is a browser extension that replaces ads in your Twitter feed with tasks from your Reminders, rendered as visually striking, interactive posts.\nIt runs on Safari and synchronizes with the Reminders App that comes preinstalled with every Mac.\nUnlike my earlier concepts, Hijack Your Feed (in Omar\u2019s words) \u201cseamlessly fits into the way you already work \u2014 the Twitter feed you already scroll through, the Reminders app you already use \u2014 rather than requiring you to adopt a new habit.\u201d\nA hijacked post that catches your eye could serve as a moment of inspiration to jumpstart a project, a gentle nudge towards chores you may be avoiding, or a simple reminder to buy more cat food.\n\nBe your own influencer\nYou don\u2019t need any design or development skills to create hijacked posts \u2014 Hijack Your Feed automatically generates them based on a wide variety of preconfigured styles.\nWe wanted hijacked posts to feel almost like ads that you\u2019re intentionally \u201cselling\u201d to yourself, and even designed them to be deliberately distracting in the same ways that real ads would be.\n\nMany of the styles we included are interactive \u2014 we wanted hijacked posts to feel playful, and for users to have fun fidgeting with them.\n\nInspired by their real ad counterparts, Hijacked posts also come with \u201cCTA\u2019s\u201d (Calls to Action). Unlike real ads however, Hijacked CTAs will not link you to sketchy websites selling knock-off Naruto merchandise. Instead, clicking on a Hijacked CTA will remove the task from your feed, while also marking it as complete in your Reminders App without the need for a manual context switch.\n\nScaling the Speculative\nThe version of Hijack Your Feed that we dropped represents a single thread in an entire tapestry of ideas that we\u2019re excited to explore.\nWhat other kinds of interesting interactive experiences outside of ticking off tasks can we hijack into a feed?\nOne lightweight and playful example that we toyed around with is a \u201cdoomscroll countdown clock\u201d that ticks as you scroll through your feed and keeps track of how long you\u2019ve been on Twitter. It acts as a playful \u201cCall to Action\u201d to \u201csave yourself\u201d by exiting Twitter and doing something else with your time (if you so desire). It\u2019s like an emergency escape hatch \u2014 for when you don\u2019t *want* to be distracted by Twitter but find yourself scrolling through Twitter anyway.\nI should note here that I don\u2019t personally believe we should be optimizing for productivity all the time, and that I enjoy a lot of the time I spend on social media. I just think, for those who wish to be more aware of their consumption habits, this playful in-feed widget may prove to be more effective than a ScreenTime notification.\nAre there experiences that might feel more ergonomic within the unique context of a feed? Tasks like\u2026 replying to spare emails, perhaps?\n\nWhat about experiences that aren\u2019t \u201cproductivity\u201d centric? In what ways can we play to or subvert the expectations of interactions that can exist in a feed?\n\n(Just for fun) Is there a world where multiple feeds can coexist at once? A choose-your-own-adventure style feed where you can scroll into and out of diverging paths?\nThis probably won\u2019t work, but might be fun to play around with.\nAnd finally, it should go without saying that we\u2019re already thinking about ways to Hijack other feeds in interesting ways\u2026\n\n\u2026as well as how Hijack Your Feed could one day scale into Hijack Everything.\nPoor cat.\n@rsnous\nLearn more about Hijack Your Feed\nDownload on the App Store.

Some have asserted that there are no wrong answers to this question. They are wrong.\nHere are three examples of what design is not:\n\u201cDesign is making something beautiful\u201d\n\u201cDesign is making something easy to use.\u201d\n\u201cDesign is making something beautiful and easy to use.\u201d\nSome of you may find this confusing. Because according to the wisdom of Twitter\u2019s top design influencers, design is form and function \u2014 how it looks and how it works, right?\nBut..\nWhy?\nWhy have we defined beauty and ease of use as the non-negotiable North Stars of design? When was the last time we\u2019ve stopped to ask ourselves, \u201cdoes the product I am working on deserve to be beautiful? Does the feature my PM wants to ship deserve to be intuitive and easy to use?\u201d\nSharing an article on Facebook is super easy \u2014 lighty tap the tip of the juicy share button to spray your followers\u2019 News Feeds with some yummy content.\nBut does such an action deserve to be so easy?\nBy making Sharing a tap or two away, have we also diluted the gravity of that action? Sharing something in the real world in front of a group of people demands conviction and bravery; we share when we believe in what we have to say so much that we are willing to risk potential humiliation and ridicule. And as someone who was trained as an actor, I can tell you that it is never easy, no matter how it may look.\nJust like how we hold Facebook\u2019s content policies accountable for igniting the spread of misinformation, so too must we examine the paradigms and systems that afforded the spreading in the first place.\nSo, what if sharing was not so easy?\nWhat if Facebook required everyone to open links before they share them? \nWhat if users were only able to share one external link per day?\nLimiting the amount/frequency of shares may add weight back to the action of Sharing, encourage users to be more thoughtful of what they share online, and improve the quality of content available on Facebook as a whole. It will add a sense of accountability to the action of sharing, and healthy communities cannot exist without accountability.\nYes, adding friction to the sharing experience would have a significant impact on Facebook\u2019s bottom line \u2014 after all, unlimited one-click shares equal exponential exposure for advertising partners. But if Facebook really wants us to believe that its North Star lies in Connecting People, such sacrifices may be necessary.\nAnother example of something that was designed to make things \u201ceasy\u201d is the infinite scroll invented by Aza Raskin. On paper, it sounds benign \u2014 and yet, the ease of use that the infinite scroll affords has been hijacked by designers at social media corporations to instead keep people in an endless machine state dedicated to consumption and \u2018engagement\u2019. What was originally intended to deliver power to people by reducing interstitial friction is instead being used to siphon agency and power away from people.\nMaybe it\u2019s time reintroduce friction in the browsing experience. \nWhat if people were asked how much time they have to browse Instagram every time they launched the Application?\nEven better, if this feature could talk to services like Lyft to generate a flow of content appropriate for the user\u2019s context without burdening the user with setting expectations?\nInstagram could then generate a curated flow of content with a hard stopping point, optimized to keep people engaged within their personally defined boundaries, politely stepping away once the user has achieved their intention.\nUnder this paradigm, users would become more aware of their relationship with technology and make necessary adjustments should they see fit. This could also act as a great intermediary step between two extremes (browsing infinitely vs. deleting your account).\nYou\u2019re probably thinking about how no PM at Facebook would ever approve the hypothetical solutions outlined above. And who would blame them? Their performance and end of year bonuses are tied to quantifiable increases in click-rate. Plus, deliberate frictions in the experience will undoubtedly lose against solutions prioritizing ease of use when it comes to things like AB testing. Quantitive user research is often misinterpreted as \u201cruthlessly optimize for engagement\u201d with little wiggle room for humanizing the experience. To quote a friend and fellow designer Davina Kim, \u201cWhy bother asking users how they feel about a design if ultimately you just ship what moves the needle?\u201d\nJust like empathy, great design cannot be quantified nor measured through engagement metrics. Great design is about empowering people to achieve their goals, not about manipulating people into doing what you want them to do. Being persuaded or manipulated into pressing a button is not the same thing as wanting to achieve something that requires pressing the button.\nDesign is political \u2014 a way of affecting human beings\u2019 relationship with power. A way of controlling the flow of power through society. An opportunity to reinforce or dismantle through thoughtful invention.\nIt is also a form of colonialism; a select group of people making decisions on behalf of a larger population, often forcing those decisions because they are supposedly \u201cbetter\u201d or \u201cmore delightful\u201d is \u2014 at its core \u2014 colonialist.\nAs designers, our job is more than just optimizing for visual elegance and/or ease of use. We must critically reflect on the role that we play in the world, to consider if what we are building is what the world needs, and to advocate on behalf of those who hold less power.\nThis might mean taking initiative and presenting a vision of a North Star we believe in. It might mean firmly pushing back on attempts to ship dark patterns. It might mean speaking up against an ordinance from higher ups that we perceive to be harmful to the world. It might mean making noise when capitalism prefers the comfort of silence. It might mean making space for the light of marginalized communities to shine through. And sometimes, it might mean walking away.\nAs long as designers continue to hold this power, designers also need to also be the ones held accountable for its misuse (intentional or not).

The Start button was a gateway to opportunity and each Folder a comfortable if imperfect container for my belongings. No matter how overwhelming the outside world became, I knew that my Desktop would stay the same.\nYears passed. Social media exploded, and the three years and ten thousand kilometers separating a teenager and his childhood dissolved with a click. My world was changing, but my Desktop stayed the same.\nYears passed. And passed. And passed. As technology accelerated, so did society\u2019s demands on our collective bandwidths. The smartphone boom led to an avalanche of Apps. Notifications multiplied pathogenically, and the corporations behind them soon learned to tug on my vulnerabilities \u2014 Engage! Now, before it\u2019s too late!\nIt all became too much, too fast. To quote a dear friend of mine, human beings simply aren\u2019t equipped with the necessary bandwidth to process the explosion of information that our world has normalized.\nTo make things worse, it turns out that the desktop metaphor underlying so much of our computing was not equipped to handle it either. In response to the increased stimuli, our Desktops simply started generating more clutter. Windows upon windows of tabs and tabs, folders within folders of Untitled(1). Never-ending, nebulous clutter.\nThis is because the Desktop was originally designed in 1973 to suit a very different need in computation\u2014the need to mirror digital content with its physical equivalent (WYSIWYG, anyone?). But in a post-Internet world (at the cusp of 5G and the AI singularity, I might add), the way we consume and produce content has largely moved away from the baggage of physicality. It also doesn\u2019t help that the Desktop has stayed the same for almost 50 years.\nSure, recent iterations of the Desktop metaphor have introduced tools and prosthetics that have helped to extend the capabilities of our computers\u2014virtual desktops and file stacks are two great examples of this. But in the end, they are all just crude workarounds\u2014band-aids on a rotting wound.\nAnd when we strip away all the chrome\u2014all the Aero and Paper and Frosted Glass, all the evidence of the \u201cdesign systems\u201d we have poured billions into developing and maintaining\u2014we come face to face with a skeleton of XEROX PARC\u2019s 1973 invention.\nThe Desktop Metaphor is Inhumane\n20 years ago, Jef Raskin (the founder of the Macintosh project) asserted that the desktop interface strategy was \u201cinefficient and inhumane.\u201d\nHere are some of the key arguments he made in his book \u201cThe Humane Interface\u201d (mixed with my personal analysis):\nThe Desktop environment enables Applications to exist. Apps are modes, and anything modal in an interface sets the user up for errors and slips. Plus, the more ways there are to do something, the more time we spend fussing over our options instead of just doing it (Hick\u2019s Law). The App economy is also just a massive waste of human capital\u2014just think about all the wasted time we have collectively spent engineering the same feature again and again for every new App, when we could have been crafting unique commands that users can choose to obtain a la carte.\nThe Desktop\u2019s reliance on the mouse as a pointing device is extraordinarily inefficient to navigate.\nFile naming and organization as a whole is an exercise in futility. When saving a document, for example, our locus of attention is not on coming up with a unique and memorable name\u2014we just want to save our work. Seemingly minor moments of friction such as this burdens our cognitive load, distracting us from our intentions and from entering flow state.\nIn addition, as someone who lives with a delightful host of neuroatypicalities, I have found it impossible to get anything done unless I reach flow-state. The frictions and distractions in conventional operating environments make that all but impossible. And don\u2019t tell me that it\u2019s just a matter of discipline. Because\u2026.\nThe System has failed us.\nRaskin defines the ideal humane interface as \u201cresponsive to human needs and considerate of human frailties.\u201d For a while I wasn\u2019t sure what he meant by that second bit, until I came to the following realization:\nAn interface that intentionally exploits the vulnerability of human beings for financial or otherwise selfish gain is inhumane and also despicable.\nAn interface that unintentionally allows the former to take place has \nnot been considerate of the full extent of human fragility, and is therefore still inhumane.\nThe endless News Feed casinos that were designed specifically to turn a generation of people into machine-state information banks? Inhumane.\nThe tippity-tappity stream of Stories optimized to maximize ~engagement~? Inhumane.\nThe desktop AND mobile operating systems that allowed for the former interaction paradigms to exist in unchecked Sandbox-App environments? Inhumane.\nIt is time for the Desktop metaphor to die.\nSo\u2026what now?\nFor 46 years we have been iterating and building our lives upon a system that is fundamentally inhumane. We have relied on and waited for the permission of the tech titans to move from one paradigm to the next. But I think the \u201ctechnology revolution\u201d has yet to come. The true revolution will come when we are able to demand and author change from a grassroots level.\nAnd so, I have made it my life\u2019s mission to help inspire this change in any way that I can. I have spent the past nine months feverishly digging rabbit holes\u2014researching, questioning, and prototyping\u2014every \u201canswer\u201d uncovering even more questions.\nThat said, I think I\u2019ve finally found something worth sharing with the world.\nIntroducing Mercury.\nMercury is a speculative vision of a modeless, fluid operating system driven by human intent.\nIt is designed for a tablet device with keyboard and multi-touch input affordances. This was a choice I made to maximize scalability in the road towards the true north star of device agnosticism. It also happens to be an existing device category currently stuck in between two worlds, with the potential to become something far greater than the sum of its parts.\nI also wish to emphasize that the ultimate goal of presenting Mercury to the world is to start conversations in the design communities I am grateful to be a part of. In doing so, I hope to open up this white-male dominated narrative to more voices of the world.\nI do not believe Mercury to be the only direction worth pursuing. However, I do hope that it will be a source of inspiration for young designers who are trying to find their place in the industry.\nBecause the world doesn\u2019t need another operating system.\nThe world needs more voices asking questions.\nAnd with that, let\u2019s begin the conversation.\nThe full case study will be released week of May 27, 2019.

She had bruises all over her body in different stages of healing \u2014 an obvious sign of child abuse.\u201d Mackenzie spent three weeks in the hospital, including some time in pediatric intensive care. The Department of Social Services (DSS) investigated and determined she was not safe and took her into protective custody.\nDespite reams of evidence about the abuse she suffered, there were multiple moments where adults turned their backs on her or actively took steps that would inflict further injury (to her education, her financial status, and her reputation). Although the State\u2019s legal system took Mackenzie into the child welfare system because of the abuse, the legal system imposed no real penalties upon those who perpetuated violence against her.\nAfter living with three different foster families, she managed to graduate from high school and got accepted to the University of Pennsylvania \u2014 where she hoping to move beyond her past.\nUnfortunately, in acts that would compound the harm to Mackenzie, Aviv reports that staff at the University of Pennsylvania, its Office of Student Conduct (OSC, which has authoritarian tenets and structures directed at students that every university across this country should reconsider), and Rhodes Trust (who initially granted Mackenzie a scholarship) decided to reinvestigate the abuse against Mackenzie.\nAt this point, they focused on government\u2019s decision not to prosecute her mother and boyfriend as being evidence against her. Despite her hospitalization and other extensive evidence, the Rhodes Trust questioned her story because her medical record included \u201cno reference to dried blood, distorted facial features, or cessation of breathing\u201d and, at a later point, the University of Pennsylvania went so far to say that she \u201cclaimed to fall ill\u201d and presented a \u201cfictitious account of abuse by her mother.\u201d\nSo what on earth would they possibly think explains being hospitalized for three weeks with serious injuries? Victims of abuse will see a very familiar and disturbing pattern here.\nAfter being exposed to a new form of trauma, Mackenzie\u2019s undergraduate degree was threatened, her graduate degree is still being withheld, and her scholarship was rescinded. As Professor Anne Norton said:\nI cannot avoid the sense that Mackenzie is being faulted for not having suffered enough. She was a foster child, but not for long enough. She is poor, but she had not been poor for long enough. She was abused, but there is not enough blood.\nA detailed point-by-point rebuttal from two professors hold the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s administration accountable for failing to uphold its commitment to students, particularly in this case.\n\nThis is all terribly recognizable to many children and young adults, as kids experience violence at home and in various institutions that are supposed to be serving children and are often not listened to or believed. But even if hidden or ignored, the truth remains.\nChildren, who are less powerful than adults, are particularly vulnerable targets for physical and sexual abuse \u2014 but also abuse of power, which is a form of \u201cchildism.\u201d\n\u201cChildism\u201d Demeans and Subjugates Children\nIn 1975, Chester Pierce and Gail Allen referred to \u201cchildism\u201d as \u201cthe automatic presumption of superiority of any adult over any child\u201d that results in actions taken toward children via \u201cauthoritative, unilateral decisions.\u201d\nPierce and Allen spoke about the misconception that \u201cthere is a belief that the society is child-oriented and that children take priority\u201d but \u201c[t]hat is, in actuality, far from the truth.\u201d\nNearly half a century later, the idea that children are prioritized remains far from a reality. There have been numerous examples of grievous U.S. scandals involving children in recent years.\nFor example, in 2018, over 150 young women came forward to a Michigan judge to tell their stories of sexual abuse and molestation by Dr. Larry Nassar, the former U.S.A. Gymnastics and Michigan State University sports clinic doctor. These young women demanded answers from U.S.A. Gymnastics and Michigan State University for failing to listen to their complaints about Nassar\u2019s criminal and unacceptable behavior as far back as 1997.\nUSA Olympic gymnastics medalist Aly Raisman wrote in the New York Times:\nAbuse goes way beyond the moment, often haunting survivors for the rest of their lives, making it difficult to trust and impacting their relationships. . . . If over these many years, just one adult listened and had the courage and character to act, this tragedy could have been avoided.\nChildren spoke up, but adults \u2014 repeatedly and for more than 20 years \u2014 didn\u2019t listen to them. The number of adults that failed these young women is astounding, but again, this is not an isolated incident.\nIn major institutions, including the Catholic Church, the Jerry Sandusky and Penn State scandal, the Boy Scouts, and the courts and juvenile justice system in the \u201cKids for Cash\u201d scandal, for example, we see time-and-time again the continued failure of our society to respect the basic human rights of children. Institutions and the adults who run them repeatedly seek to \u201cprotect their interests\u201d rather than listen to and act to protect children and youth.\nOur nation must do better.\nChildren should be guaranteed fundamental human rights and protections. Unfortunately, as Michael Freeman writes:\nMore attention is paid to animal rights, even to the rights of rivers and rocks, than is paid to children\u2019s rights. Advocates of children\u2019s rights are often relegated to the margins of human rights.\nIn her book Hidden in Plain Sight: The Tragedy of Child Rights from Ben Franklin to Lionel Tate, Barbara Woodhouse notes that the subjugation of children in our legal system is both shocking and sweeping:\nMost would be astonished to learn that abused and neglected children in state custody have fewer rights than accused criminals. While a long line of Supreme Court cases has addressed the rights of adults to counsel when taken into state custody, to protection of their property from unjust takings, and to protection of their familial ties, the Supreme Court has never held that a foster child has a right to legal representation, a right to speak in his own court case, a right not to be deprived of property without due process, or a right to contact with his family.\nThis lack of recognition to the fundamental rights of children sometimes even continues when kids become young adults. In Mackenzie Fierceton\u2019s case, at various points in her life, some adults inflicted physical and sexual abuse, others dismissed that abuse, others actively attacked her for daring to ask for help, and still others have used their individual and institutional power to inflict further abuse into adulthood.\nRecognizing the Fundamental Rights of Children\nFortunately, at some key moments in our legal system, the fundamental rights of children and youth have been recognized. For example, Supreme Court Justice Abe Fortas recognized the fundamental rights of children in his majority opinion in Tinker v. Des Moines Independent School District (1969). He wrote:\nIn our system, state-operated schools may not be enclaves of totalitarianism. School officials do not possess absolute authority over their students. Students in school as well as out of school are \u201cpersons\u201d under our Constitution. They are possessed of fundamental rights which the State must respect, just as they themselves must respect their obligations to the State. . . In the absence of a specific showing of constitutionally valid reasons to regulate their speech, students are entitled to freedom of expression of their views.\nJustice Fortas adds:\nIt can hardly be argued that either students or teachers shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate.\nA few years later, Justice Harry Blackmun writes in Planned Parenthood of Central Missouri v. Danforth (1976):\nConstitutional rights do not mature and come into being magically only when one attains the state-defined age of majority. Minors, as well as adults, are protected by the Constitution and possess constitutional rights.\nOur children and young people need our laws, policies, and institutions to ensure that the \u201cbest interests of children\u201d are a primary consideration. The vast majority of people in this country strongly agree with that notion. In a poll conducted by Lake Research Partners on election eve 2020, voters strongly support (81\u201313%) policy being \u201cgoverned by a best interest of the child\u201d standard.\nSource: Lake Research Partners, Oct. 31-Nov. 3, 2020\nNo more looking away, invisiblizing, ignoring, or dismissing the issues and needs of children.\nWe must also reject laws and institutions that treat children as \u201cchattel\u201d or the property of parents, and that assume children lack independent reason, agency, or understanding of their own \u201cbest interests.\u201d The law should balance the interests of parents (who have a developed relationship with a child), the state\u2019s parens patriae role that should be focused on the protection and \u201cbest interests\u201d of the child, and the child\u2019s own expressed interests and needs.\n\nKids \u2014 their voices, their needs, their concerns \u2014 must count and matter.\nChildren need the support of both parents and government. But sometimes children need protection from both parents and government, such as when children are physically or sexually abused by parents and the government\u2019s child welfare and juvenile justice systems compound and unduly harm children.\nWhy the \u201cParental Rights\u201d Movement Fails Children\nUnfortunately, there is a political movement that is pushing in the opposite direction and would threaten the health, education, safety, and well-being of children across this country. Under the guise of \u201cparental rights,\u201d this movement seeks to enshrine \u201cchildism\u201d (defined by Aleisa Myles as \u201cprejudice and oppression against children\u201d) into law by effectively eliminating any recognition of the voice or the rights of children altogether while simultaneously gutting any affirmative responsibility of parents to their children or for government to look out for the \u201cbest interests\u201d of children.\nThis movement is not new. Even up until a century ago, kids were seen as the property of their parents. Woodhouse writes:\nAs late as 1920, a parent who killed a child in the course of punishment could claim a legal excuse for homicide in no fewer than nine states. Well into the nineteenth century, a father could enroll his male children in the army and collect the enrollment bounty, betroth his minor female children to persons of his choice, and put his children to work as day laborers on farms or factories and collect their wage packets.\nBut family law has evolved. According to Woodhouse:\nAs family law matured, American law increasingly characterized parents as the guardians not the owners of their children. Parental rights were regrounded in the presumption that parents are motivated by love for their children, share a deep commitment to their children\u2019s future, and will act in their children\u2019s best interests.\nThere is no doubt that parents deserve deference in the upbringing of their children. That is not in dispute. Indeed, it is already in law.\nThe problem arises when some parents are simply unable to live up to the responsibilities and duties of parenting, as in the case of Mackenzie Fierceton and the litany of other scandals cited above. The reality is that, tragically, some parents are violent, criminal, unfit, and a danger to children and that institutions and government also fail children.\nIn case we all need reminding, a Commission to Eliminate Child Abuse and Neglect Fatalities published an extensive report in 2016 that found:\nEvery day, four to eight children in the United States die from abuse or neglect at the hands of their parents or caretakers. No one knows the exact number, and there has been little progress in preventing these tragic deaths. Most of the children who die are infants or toddlers.\nSamantha Godwin, resident fellow at Yale Law School, writes:\nWhen evaluating the extent of parents\u2019 legal rights, we should not merely consider how ideal parents exercise their power to provide the effective care and guidance children need. The extent of what the law enables imperfect parents to do to their children must also be taken into account. The issue is not only what role we hope that parents play in their children\u2019s lives, but how the powers actually granted might be used and abused for better or worse. Thinking only in terms of how the best parents conduct themselves is a mistake; it is also necessary to account for what the worst parents can get away with.\nUnfortunately, the \u201cparental rights\u201d movement, supported by groups like Moms for Liberty, the Manhattan Institute, and the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), are seeking to rollback basic protections that have been gained for children over the last century.\nMoms for Liberty\u2019s Tiffany Justice and Tina Descovitch argue, \u201cMoms for Liberty is fighting to restore the role of primary decision maker for children back to parents by helping them organize and amplify their voices.\u201d\nFirst, parents never lost authority as the primary decision-makers. But their tactics and the bills they support are disastrous for children. They are seeking to turn government into a punitive actor (\u201cdon\u2019t say gay, don\u2019t discuss racism, don\u2019t read that book, don\u2019t get vaccines, don\u2019t ask questions, don\u2019t step out of line, don\u2019t question authority\u201d) rather than a protector of children while simultaneously gutting the fundamental rights of children.\nFor example, there is a deep and long-held understanding that public schools play important societal roles beyond just individual interests. Public schools serve to further our democracy, help achieve social mobility and success, and help students understand math, science, literature, the arts, and history to fully become the next generation of leaders. The focus of public schools should always be focused on children \u2014 their education, their health, their safety, and their well-being. Moms for Liberty wishes to end this.\nIn fact, the focus of public education on children has started to slip away in Florida. For example, Florida\u2019s recently passed Parents Bill of Rights (HB 241) includes the following language:\nThe state, any of its political subdivisions, any other governmental entity, or any other institution may not infringe on the fundamental rights of a parent to direct the upbringing, education, health care, and mental health of his or her minor child without demonstrating that such action is reasonable and necessary to achieve a compelling state interest and that such action is narrowly tailored and is not otherwise served by a less restrictive means.\nThis may seem innocuous, but the sweeping language, which is similar to bills proposed in a number of other states across the country, would preclude or limit any action by the government or any other institution, such as laws that protect the health, education, and safety of children from abuse unless \u201cnecessary to achieve a compelling state interest\u201d and the \u201cleast restrictive\u201d possible.\nCourts would likely rule this new language to be quite different than the historical parens patrie state role that serves to protect the \u201cbest interests\u201d of the child in a number of matters, including child abuse, child custody, etc. In short, the \u201cinterests\u201d of individual parents will take precedent over the needs and interests of children, even in schools. Kids will return to being viewed as the property of parents under HB 241.\nAs Florida Rep. Susan Vald\u00e9s (D-Tampa) said to WPTV in West Palm Beach:\nI can\u2019t support the bill because I am thinking about all of the children. Not just those that have good parents.\nThe \u201cparental rights\u201d movement sees Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas as an ally in this effort to change the focus of public education from one that addresses the educational, health, safety needs of children and respects the rights of children to one of obedience and compliance of students to the whims of adults (i.e., \u201cchildism\u201d). In Morse v. Frederick (2007), Thomas writes:\nIn my view, the history of public education suggests that the First Amendment, as originally understood, does not protect student speech in public schools.\nThomas goes so far as to argue for overturning the judicial precedent in Tinker v. Des Moines Community Independent School District (1969) that asserted children do have basic and fundamental First Amendment rights. According to Thomas:\n\u2026early public schools were not places for freewheeling debates or exploration of competing ideas. Rather, teachers instilled \u201ca core of common values\u201d in students and taught them self-control\u2026. Teachers instilled these values not only by presenting ideas but also through strict discipline. Schools punished students for behavior the school considered disrespectful or wrong. Rules of etiquette were enforced, and courteous behavior was demanded. To meet their educational objectives, schools required absolute obedience.\nIn case it isn\u2019t clear, Thomas is attempting to sanction the physical abuse of children here.\nBeyond education, Florida\u2019s Parents Bill of Rights (HB 241) also threatens the health of children by saying doctors and nurses cannot provide any services to a child \u201cwithout first obtaining written parental consent.\u201d\nWhat happens when parents are abusers and kids fear their wrath so fail to get treatment, parents disagree, parents are absent, parents believe that cannabis, alkaline diets, or prayer are how kids should be treated for cancer, children have an emergency, or parents believe that kids should not receive access to mental health or substance abuse treatment, birth control, vaccines, or treatment for sexually transmitted diseases?\nWhat about the cases of children who seek treatment for child abuse injuries? Can parents deny they exist and deny treatment?\nUnfortunately, these cases happen. Parents can make tragic decisions that threaten the health and lives of children. In states like Idaho, \u201cparental rights\u201d language is directly linked to the deaths of children.\nIn addition to denying children their basic rights to obtain access to life-saving health care services, HB 241\u2019s language takes the additional step of allowing parents to demand certain health care treatment be performed on their children. It reads:\nThe right to make health care decisions for his or her minor child, unless otherwise prohibited by law\u2026.\nFlorida\u2019s Parents Bill of Rights adds:\nUnless required by law, the rights of a parent of a minor child in this state may not be limited or denied. This chapter may not be construed to apply to a parent action or decision that would end life.\nShort of an action or decision that would result in death, this language suggests parental rights \u201cmay not be limited or denied,\u201d even if it might be detrimental to the health and well-being of children and against the will of a child or adolescent. This is astounding.\nFor example, some parents across the country have bought into an array of false or dangerous treatment for autism that, according to NBC News, included \u201cindustrial bleach\u2026, turpentine or their children\u2019s own urine as the secret miracle drug for reversing autism.\u201d\nThe language reopens grave concerns about the role some parents have played in decisions to impose female genital mutilation, conversion \u201ctherapy,\u201d rebirthing \u201ctherapy,\u201d certain types of involuntary institutionalization of children, seclusion and restraint, forced sterilization of children with disabilities, and other harmful or detrimental \u201ccare\u201d.\nConsequently, children and youth appear to have limited to almost no recognizable rights under the \u201cparental rights\u201d bill language, even on matters where their health and well-being is at stake. The only exception to parental rights is a limited exception for a \u201ccompelling state interest\u201d rather than the \u201cbest interests\u201d or \u201crights\u201d of children themselves.\nThis is a form of \u201cchildism.\u201d It is anti-child.\nChildren Have Rights and Must Be Seen and Heard\nIn Troxel v. Granville (2000), Justice John Paul Stevens articulated the need for independent constitutional rights of children in his dissent in the case involving the visitation rights of grandparents. While he agreed with the \u201cpresumption that parental decisions generally serve the best interests of their children,\u201d he noted that \u201ceven a fit parent is capable of treating a child like a mere possession.\u201d Stevens adds:\nCases like this do not present a bipolar struggle between the parents and the State over who has final authority to determine what is in a child\u2019s best interests. There is at minimum a third individual, whose interests are implicated in every case to which the statute applies \u2014 the child\u2026. [T]o the extent parents and families have fundamental liberty interests in preserving such intimate relationships, so, too, do children have these interests, and so, too, must their interests be balanced in the equation.\nJustice Stevens is right. As you are reading stories about issues of importance to children and even the \u201cparental rights\u201d movement, notice how often there is little to no attention or focus on the voices, needs, \u201cbest interests,\u201d and fundamental rights of children, even with respect to matters that are all about them.\nAs Michael Freeman writes in his book The Moral Status of Children:\nIt is important that all those that formulate policy should be compelled to consider the impact their policies have on children.\nUnfortunately, children are often an afterthought in policy debates. We have witnessed the failure to consider their best interests time and time again. Freeman adds:\nAll too rarely is consideration given to what policies\u2026do to children. This is all the more the case where the immediate focus of the policy is not children. But even in children\u2019s legislation the unintended or indirect effects of changes are not given the critical attention they demand\u2026.\nThis is one reason why the piece by Rachel Aviv about Mackenzie Fierceton is so important. It centers the debate on her life, her needs, her challenges, and her rights \u2014 not those of just the adults.\nCases like Mackenzie Fierceton, the child deaths cited by the Commission to Eliminate Child Abuse and Neglect Fatalities, and the victims of abuse by the Catholic Church, the U.S. Women\u2019s Gymnastics team, the Boy Scouts, etc., argue for more rights and protections for children \u2014 not fewer.\nAfter all, as Freeman notes:\nThe most fundamental of rights is the right to possess rights.\nOver 30 years ago, the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) proclaimed that every child \u201cshould grow up in a family environment, in an atmosphere of happiness, love and understanding\u201d and be raised \u201cin the spirit of peace, dignity, tolerance, freedom, equality and solidarity.\u201d Unfortunately, the United States is the only nation in the world that has failed to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.\nAdopting a Pro-Children and Families Agenda\nFrankly, the vast majority of parents are not calling for the sweeping \u201cparental rights\u201d agenda in HB 241 and that is moving in other states. Most parents are not \u201chelicopter parents\u201d seeking to control and direct over every single aspect of the lives of their children, including the privatization of public schools, the micromanagement of teachers, book bans, censorship, the whitewashing of history, and laws so they can use the power of government to inflict their will upon children, including the use of lawsuits against schools, teachers, pediatricians, nurses, etc. to enforce this power.\nSource: CBS News/YouGov Poll, Feb. 15\u201318, 2022\nInstead, parents want what is best for their kids and see teachers, coaches, child care providers, pediatricians, and others as allies (and not as adversaries) in the care of children. After all, teachers, coaches, child care providers, pediatricians, and others have dedicated their careers to the well-being of children.\nDr. Dana Suskind, author of the forthcoming book Parent Nation and a pediatric surgeon, explains:\nTime and time again, I heard parents express a desire for community, a sense of camaraderie, societal supports that would allow them to parent the way their children need and deserve.\nDr. Suskind adds:\n\u2026enhanced support for parents and young children can and should be championed by anyone who has ever loved a child, and anyone who wants to see our nation live up to both its ideals and its full potential.\nInstead, we underinvest in children and families. Between 2016 and 2020, for example, the share of federal spending invested in children declined by 25%.\nSource: First Focus on Children, Children\u2019s Budget 2021\nInstead, we need a new forward-looking and supportive agenda for children and families. This is why the vast majority of parents support a Children and Families Agenda that includes things such as:\nEnactment of the Child Tax Credit improvements (its expiration has led to a $1,000\u20133,600 per child increase in taxes on families);\nThe adoption of a \u201cbest interests\u201d standard for children in public policy;\nMore funding for public schools, pre-K, and child care;\nEnsuring every child has health care coverage and access to care;\nFamily medical leave;\nTeaching children a challenging education curriculum that is inspiring and grounded in truth about science and history;\nThe establishment of an independent Commissioner for Children to ensure the needs and voices of children are considered; and,\nInitiatives that would work toward preventing and eliminating child poverty, child hunger, child homelessness, and child abuse.\nSource: Lake Research Partners, Oct. 31-Nov. 3, 2020\nLet\u2019s put an end to \u201cchildism\u201d and support an affirmative and positive agenda that raises up and supports children and families.

DeSantis: Anti-Safety, Anti-Science, Anti-Vax, and Anti-Child", "content": "Gov. DeSantis: Anti-Safety, Anti-Science, Anti-Vax, and Anti-Child\nMost parents and communities seek to do whatever it takes to promote the success of children and to protect them from harm, particularly when that harm can be prevented or significantly reduced. In contrast, although politicians often ignore and treat children as an afterthought, they often have sympathy for kids and most do not actively seek to do harm to them. But shockingly, there are others that seem to delight in bullying and harming kids.\nIn the case of Florida\u2019s Gov. Ron DeSantis, he aggressively chooses to bully and harm in a number of ways, including undermining efforts by parents, schools, and others to protect Florida\u2019s children from harm during the global COVID-19 pandemic and economic recession.\n\nFirst, at the close of the 20th century, the lifespan of Americans had grown by over 30 years. Immunizations were highlighted as the biggest factor in this success, as smallpox was eradicated, polio was eliminated on our continent, and deaths from other infectious diseases like measles, rubella, tetanus, and diphtheria were substantially reduced, particularly among children.\nVaccines have proven to have made the greatest impact on the health and lives of people in human history. Immunizations are the most effective way to protect our children from harm, including death. Science works.\nConsequently, scientists, doctors, public health officials, parents, and government have successfully worked together to ensure that the vast majority of America\u2019s children are vaccinated from preventable life-threatening infectious diseases.\nThis protects all of us.\nA wide majority of Americans have long supported ensuring that all children receive the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended vaccines before entering schools. Every state in the nation has chosen to protect the health and well-being of children in this way. An analysis by the Florida Department of Health issued on Feb. 7, 2022, for example, reported that 93.3 percent of children in kindergarten and 94.5 percent of 7th graders met \u201cthe vaccination requirement for their grade.\u201d Most parents want to protect their children from preventable infectious diseases.\nUnfortunately, in recent years, diseases that we believed to have been eradicated have reemerged due to clusters of anti-vax misinformation being spread by various groups in certain communities on social media, including Facebook groups. This has led to outbreaks of infectious diseases, including measles in Florida, among children.\nProblems with vaccine misinformation and take-up rates were compounded when the global COVID-19 pandemic hit, including the myth that took hold in some circles that children were \u201clargely immune.\u201d\n\nThe fact is that kids are not immune. They never were.\nInstead, children have unique health care needs due to the fact that disease, stress and trauma, and health interventions are almost always different for kids than adults. In some ways, it can be far more complicated and complex. Children are more vulnerable and resilient at the same time.\nDr. Kurt Newman, President and CEO of Children\u2019s National Hospital, explains:\nWhen you think about a child, they need protection. They\u2019re not fully formed or fully mature. Their organs are not what they\u2019re going to be. But at the same time, that immaturity allows so much bounce back and so much healing and so much ability. So you have to take both those things into mind as you take care of a child.\nThe fact is that every aspect of the lives of children has been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and economic recession. But that has been an afterthought among many of our nation\u2019s policymakers. As UNICEF says, \u201cChildren are the hidden victims of the coronavirus crisis.\u201d\n\nAs an example, on April 8, 2020, Gov. DeSantis declared:\nThis particular epidemic is one where, I don\u2019t think nationwide there\u2019s been a single fatality under 25. For whatever reason it just doesn\u2019t seem to threaten, you know, kids.\nThat was clearly false.\n\nBut that statement is now embarrassing and tragic. National data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) show that nearly 1,500 children ages 0\u201317 have died from COVID-19 and over 115,000 children have been hospitalized. Nearly 7,500 children have developed the serious condition known as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) and there is increasing concern and evidence that COVID-19 may have negative consequences on the brain, rates of diabetes, and other conditions, such as long-COVID.\nChildren are neither immune nor invincible from contracting COVID-19. The impact on them is just different. While kids may be dying from COVID at lower rates than older Americans, that is true with most life-threatening diseases, such as cancer and heart disease. But the fact is that COVID-19 is now a Top 10 cause of death among children and the rates of infection and hospitalization rose dramatically in late 2021 and early 2022.\n\n\nDeaths and hospitalizations in children should never be dismissed.\n\n\nFurthermore, under no circumstances is it an acceptable rationale to simply \u201cdo nothing\u201d related to children simply because risk is lower, particularly since deaths and severe illnesses, such as hospitalizations, can be mitigated or prevented with vaccines, use of masks, and other public health measures.\nAnd yet, \u201cdoing nothing\u201d or actively doing harm is what Gov. DeSantis is doing. First, he publicly bullied high school students who were wearing masks at a recent press conference by telling them to remove them and declaring masks \u201cCOVID theater.\u201d\n\nOne of those students has a parent who has a compromised immune system.\n\nRather than apologizing for his behavior or that of his staff, instead, Gov. DeSantis sought to fundraise off his behavior.\n\nAll of this has occurred at a moment when we are rapidly closing in on 1 million deaths \u2014 grandparents, parents, siblings, children, friends, and other family \u2014 in this country from COVID-19. Recent estimates are that more than 240,000 children in the U.S. have lost a primary or secondary caregiver to COVID-19. It is estimated that Florida has the 6th highest rate of caregiver deaths in the country.\nGov. DeSantis also pushed legislation to strip $200 million from Florida school districts whose leaders sought to protect the health and safety of their children and teachers with public health measures, such as masking to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in their communities. From the data, it is clear that this will disproportionately harm urban public schools and children of color \u2014 the very same kids who have been disproportionately negatively impacted by the COVID pandemic.\nBut even worse than all of that, Gov. DeSantis\u2019s Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo, at the close of a forum (where people falsely asserted that healthy children had not died of COVID-19, argued against vaccinations for children, but promoted horse deworming treatments), declared that Florida was going to be the first state to \u201cofficially recommend against the COVID-19 vaccines for healthy children.\u201d\n\nIt might be the first state, but it should reverse itself and be the last state to do so.\nFlorida\u2019s American Academy of Pediatrics chapter president Dr. Lisa Gwynn called Ladapo\u2019s statement \u201cirresponsible\u201d and said \u201cthere is widespread consensus among medical and public health experts about the life-saving benefits of this vaccine.\u201d\nGwynn adds:\nThe [Florida] Surgeon General\u2019s comments. . .misrepresent the benefits of the vaccine, which has been proven to prevent serious illness, hospitalizations, and long-term symptoms from Covid-19 in children and adolescents, including those who are otherwise healthy.\nDr. Mobeen Rathore, associate chair of the department of pediatrics at the University of Florida\u2019s College of Medicine, has expressed grave disappointment with the notion that vaccines are not needed by children who are \u201chealthy\u201d because they are less likely to die. As he said:\nWe see these sick children who don\u2019t need to be that sick if they would have gotten the vaccine. And you know, tell that to a parent whose child is in the ICU or is very ill or intubated or very sick, \u2018Oh, you know, most children don\u2019t really get very sick with this,\u2019 and see the reaction you get.\nI think that\u2019s really sad that we feel that it\u2019s okay for some children to get sick, get hospitalized and die of this disease, when we could clearly prevent that.\n\nDr. Jeffrey Goldhagen, the Chief of Pediatrics at University of Florida Health Jacksonville, urged people to listen to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American Academy of Pediatrics about their strong recommendations that children get vaccinations rather than Ladapo. Goldhagen said:\nThere was a study that came out [earlier this week] that indicated that children who are vaccinated have eight times less chance of getting the disease.\nChildren do get the disease. They do get sick from the disease. They get hospitalized from the disease. They die from the disease. And this policy will result in increased morbidity and mortality amongst children.\nIn addition to the harm to children that will result from lower vaccination rates for COVID-19, the anti-vax rhetoric of the DeSantis Administration will undoubtedly lead to a drop in overall vaccination rates against other preventable infectious diseases.\nAs Florida pediatrician Dr. Robin Strauss said:\nI\u2019m old enough to have seen children be hospitalized, to have permanent brain damage and permanent physical damages, and to die from diseases that are now vaccine-preventable. . . . It\u2019s just mind-boggling to think that we could go back to that. The diseases are waiting.\nUnder Gov. DeSantis, Florida has long had a disturbing and exclusionary pattern for giving vaccines or following the science regarding vaccines.\n\nFlorida\u2019s Department of Health seems incapable of even properly ordering enough vaccines for pediatricians and parents to provide to children.\n\nThe science calls for the vaccination of children. For example, as reported in the New England Journal of Medicine, the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine \u201cin 12-to-15-year-old recipients had a favorable safety profile, produced a greater immune response than in young adults, and was highly effective against Covid-19.\u201d According to the study, kids benefit even more than adults from this vaccine, and yet, the DeSantis Administration is now advising kids not to be vaccinated.\nTo do so, the DeSantis Administration had to ignore the science. Florida\u2019s Department of Health cited a line or two in three studies but ignored the conclusions. As Ian Hodgson reports, \u201cEach of the three studies cited by the state concluded vaccines are safe and effective.\u201d\n\nRarely do you see a politician that actively seeks to go out of their way to take positions that affirmatively harm children or puts them in harm\u2019s way, as Gov. Ron DeSantis has. The number of anti-child actions by Florida\u2019s governor is substantial and goes well beyond this partial list: \ud83d\udc47\n\nAs examples of other negligent actions by the DeSantis Administration on children\u2019s issues, Florida failed to apply for $820 million in food aid for children and \u201cfailed for nearly three months to pay tens of thousand of health care claims for the state\u2019s sickest and neediest children.\u201d\nSeriously, at some point, you must call it out for what it is. Gov. DeSantis\u2019s policies are anti-safety, anti-science, anti-immunization, and certainly not pro-life.\nIn fact, his policies and positions are anti-child.", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 0, "created_time": 1647034523536, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Children", "Vaccines", "Covid-19", "Politics", "Health"]}, {"author": "Bruce Lesley", "post_id": "884616a272e4", "user_id": "5108137b92f6", "title": "The Kids Still Aren\u2019t Alright: Putting the Health, Education, and Safety of Kids First", "content": "The Kids Still Aren\u2019t Alright: Putting the Health, Education, and Safety of Kids First\nThe kids still aren\u2019t alright.\nDespite the initial disregard for how COVID-19 was impacting children, a majority of people began to recognize that the global pandemic, which has been the biggest public health crisis we have seen in a century, and the resulting economic recession have impacted each and every aspect of the lives of children in a profound way.\nThis global pandemic has required the world to learn about the evolving science of the COVID virus and its impact on people. The medical community and scientists are still learning about the implications of COVID and are repeatedly faced with new variants and changes they are causing with respect to severity and spread of the virus. Medicine and public policy have needed (but have not always succeeded) to adjust in real time.\nMany of us are experiencing COVID fatigue, but the absence of a policy or a plan to address the health, education, and safety of children is failing them.\nFor children, who are often treated as an afterthought in public policy, they have struggled to deal with:\n1) Budget Cuts: Federal, state, and local budget cuts to children\u2019s programs over the prior decade that had negatively impacted their well-being even prior to the COVID pandemic and economic recession;\n2) School Closures: School closures and threats to their education that included the inability for many families to access education offered online;\n3) COVID Infections and Deaths: Illness and threats to their family members (an estimated 175,000 children have lost a parent or grandparent caregiver through this epidemic);\n4) Last to be Vaccinated: The inability for children to be eligible for vaccinations (vaccines for 5\u201311 year-olds were only recently approved and vaccines are still unavailable to children under age 5);\n5) Rising Uninsured Rates: Rising uninsurance rates and threats to other aspects of the health of children, including a drop in routine vaccinations, well-child visits, health care screenings, mental and dental health care services, etc.;\n6) Threats to Children\u2019s Mental Health: Threats to the mental health of children during lockdowns and school closures and overuse of social media;\n7) Declining Indicators of Child Well-Being: Poor performance by the U.S. on indicators of children well-being, including child poverty, child hunger, child homelessness, and child abuse due to the economic recession and pandemic;\n8) Misinformation Campaigns: Misinformation campaigns and a toxic social media culture that have made a large number of parents leery of trusting guidance from medical and health professionals for vaccines, including COVID but including vaccines against measles, polio, rubella, tetanus, etc.;\n9) Children\u2019s Needs Treated as an Afterthought: The sidelining of children and their needs, concerns, and best interests with respect to policies that impact their lives (think about all you have seen or read about schools, masking, vaccines, child care, the Child Tax Credit, child hunger, child abuse, homelessness, child suicides, etc. and the rage that adults have exhibited on all sides with little or no thought about asking the kids, who actually have thoughts about what they want or need); and,\n10) Toxic Political Culture: A toxic political culture where some politicians and astroturf political organizations, have tried to use the crisis for political purposes and gain rather than advancing a national bipartisan plan to combat the twin threats of the pandemic and economic crises.\nNone of this has been good for children. The result is that kids, who were not alright before the pandemic and recession, are doing even worse today.\nMistakes were undoubtedly made. We were probably too quick to support school closures to protect the health and well-being of children and too slow to reopen schools. However, we collectively learned about the negative consequences this was having on the education, mental health, safety (potential rising child abuse rates and increasing online threats), and social development of children. All aspects of the lives of children have to be considered, including both the pros and unintended consequences of policy choices. Consequently, doing everything possible to keep schools open should be a priority.\nHowever, with respect to that priority, it is disturbing that people are attacking doctors, public health experts, school boards, other policymakers, and even students themselves for doing all they can to keep schools open, including facilitating student and school employee vaccinations and promoting masking, testing, contact tracing, air purification, and testing to keep children and educators healthy and safe.\n\n\nIf you truly want kids to be in school, then it is incumbent on schools to mitigate the spread of COVID. The virus causes children to be home sick or quarantined and away from school. In some cases, the virus spread among students and teachers is extreme enough to cause school closures. Schools are scrambling to find substitute teachers to replace teachers, who are leaving the profession due to stress, lack of support, or illness.\n\nUnfortunately, in the states of Florida, Texas, Tennessee, Arizona, and a few other states and at the local level, there are governors or local lawmakers that are actively blocking public health officials and school districts from attempting to protect the health and safety of their students and teachers. In effect, their policy is one of doing nothing, or even worse, actively preventing the protection of children and educators from harm.\nIn the midst of all of this, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is promoting legislation that would promote lawsuits against teachers who \u201csmuggle in\u201d what he deems to be \u201cinappropriate content,\u201d Texas Rep. Matt Krause has created a list of 850 books to be possibly banned from libraries and classrooms, the Iowa Senate President Jack Chapman has threatened to jail teachers because they have a \u201csinister agenda,\u201d and Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey simply proposes nothing for education but potshots.\n\n\nDoing nothing or promoting harm under the auspices of \u201cparental rights\u201d does not result in a coherent plan or mitigation strategy to protect the health, education, and safety of children. In fact, it can be quite detrimental.\nShockingly, in defense of doing nothing, some have argued that \u201conly a small percentage of children are dying.\u201d\n\nUnder no circumstances is that an acceptable rationale for any policy related to children, particularly since deaths and severe illnesses can be mitigated or prevented with vaccines, use of masks, and other public health measures. For example, the number of cases and hospitalizations for children are rising and now at all-time highs.\nSource: American Academy of Pediatrics and Children\u2019s Hospital Association\n\n\nChildren are also experiencing long-term complications from COVID, but the extent of such problems remain unknown. What we do know if that getting vaccinated significantly reduces long-haul COVID problems.\n\n\nThe failure to protect the health and safety of children is simply immoral.\nEven if individual parents think their child or children might not die, become hospitalized, or contract long-term complications such as neurological impairments, organ inflammation, heart, diabetes, or lung problems, or diabetes from COVID, it is unconscionable to disregard the much greater threat that COVID poses to the lives of children with disabilities or that have compromised immune systems or their teachers.\nIn addition, when teachers, bus drivers, school nurses, and counselors become ill, schools are unable to educate children. And, as noted above, if COVID infections rise to certain levels, it forces school closures. Therefore, if you really care about keeping schools open, then taking public health measures intended to protect the health and safety of children and educators is a no-brainer.\nNobody should need to be reminded that COVID has killed over 800,000 people in this country. The lead author of a study published in Pediatrics estimates this includes 175,000 caregivers of children. Susan Hillis, epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, explained:\nThis means that for every four COVID-19 deaths, one child was left behind without a mother, father and/or a grandparent who provided for that child\u2019s home needs and nurture \u2014 needs such as love, security and daily care.\nThe impact is life-long. As the study\u2019s authors write:\n. . .the lives of these children are permanently changed by the deaths of their mothers, fathers, or grandparents who provided their homes, needs, and care.\nOur nation\u2019s children are neither fine or \u201cimmune\u201d from this pandemic.\nOur family loved our children\u2019s pediatricians because they have an extremely caring and supportive practice that puts the health and well-being of children first, makes decisions in partnership with parents, but ensures that science and medicine are the key factors in making decisions about the care and treatment of children. As they explain in their mission statement:\nOur goal is not only to keep your children healthy, but also to nurture your family and provide guidance to you as parents so that your children grow into secure, happy and successful adults.\nWe should all strive toward that goal.\nThe American Rescue Plan (ARP) Was Pro-Child and Significantly Cut Children Poverty but Key Provisions Have Expired\nFortunately, in early 2021, President Biden and Congress recognized the incredible harm that children were experiencing from the twin threats of the pandemic and recession and enacted the American Rescue Plan (ARP) Act. ARP included provisions to improve major flaws in the Child Tax Credit (CTC) that prevented 26 million low-income children from receiving the full credit because their parents made \u201ctoo little\u201d money. Fixing this flaw and expanding the CTC from $2,000 per child to $3,000 per child under age 18 and $3,600 per child under age 6 is estimated to cut child poverty by more than 40%.\nSource: Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, \u201cTax Credits in Build Back Better Support Millions of Families\u201d\nThere were other important provision in that bill for kids, but they too are expiring.\n\nAs the leading example, the CTC improvements expired on New Year\u2019s Day of this year due to the opposition or inaction of all 50 Republican senators and Democrat Joe Manchin.\nGridlock and inaction are a threat to children and often worse than nothing. In this case, during an ongoing global pandemic in which children continue to face all sorts of threats to their health, education, and safety, the families of 65 million children will experience a significant tax increase (between $1,000 and $3,600 per child) in 2022 and child poverty will nearly double.\n\nChild poverty costs our society an estimated $800 billion to $1.1 trillion annually in terms of declining outcomes for children with respect to education and health care and rising incidents of child hunger, homelessness, child abuse, and juvenile justice that fail to ensure that children \u201cgrow into secure, happy and successful adults.\u201d\nThe Build Back Better Act, which passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 220\u2013213 in November, has failed to move forward in the U.S. Senate due to opposition to the bill by a number of special interests, including those seeking to protect tax breaks for the wealthiest in our society. Billionaire Elon Musk, who once wrongly declared children were \u201clargely immune\u201d from COVID may be happy that the U.S. Senate is failing to act, but our nation\u2019s 74 million children and their families deserve so much better.\nWhile there are some fringe groups like Moms for Liberty that are pushing to block COVID health and safety measures, privatize and undermine our nation\u2019s public schools, ban books by award-winning authors like Toni Morrison, Ruby Bridges, and Jerry Craft, whitewash history, and impose barriers for students to access mental health counseling and services, this is not an agenda that most parents and children support.\nIn a November 2021 poll by the Dallas Morning News and the University of Texas at Tyler, Texas voters supported permitting teachers \u201cto discuss how historical examples of discrimination in our laws apply to inequalities today\u201d by a 59\u201324% margin. Furthermore, by a 66\u201328% margin, those surveyed had little to no confidence in the \u201cjudgement of elected state leaders in reviewing what books are controversial and should be removed from K-12 schools.\u201d\nInstead, a real Children\u2019s Agenda is one that truly promotes the health, education, and safety of children.\n\nThis includes passage of the Build Back Better Act, which extends the Child Tax Credit (which hundreds of national, state, and local organizations and over 400 of our nation\u2019s leading economists support), provides funding to support child care, pre-K, and child health, and helps reduce child abuse, child hunger, homelessness, and climate change. This is an agenda that the American people, including parents and children, strongly support (by a 61\u201332% margin in this Data for Progress/Invest in America poll).\n\nThe Senate should consider renaming Build Back Better as the Children and Families Act and get it passed. We should do our best to make the kids alright, but at the very least, don\u2019t leave millions of children worse off in 2022.", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 62, "created_time": 1641846964224, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Children", "Health", "Safety", "Education", "Senate"]}, {"author": "Tatyana Deryugina", "post_id": "25da37654416", "user_id": "54381682e587", "title": "Ukraine versus Russia by the numbers", "content": "Ukraine versus Russia by the numbers\n\nMany people think of pre-war Ukraine and Russia as very similar. Right before the full-scale invasion on February 24, a few people even wondered out loud if it would be so bad to have Ukraine become part of Russia. Ukraine has been called \u201cLittle Russia\u201d, including by an Italian TV host. But it would be a mistake to think that just because the two countries are next to each other and share a common history that they are interchangeable.

Ukraine is significantly more free than Russia when it comes to political and civil freedoms as well as freedom of the press. Even on the metric they are closest on, LGBTQ equality, Ukraine is clearly leading.\nSources: Freedom House (Political and Civil Freedoms: Russia Ukraine); Reporters Without Borders (Press Freedoms: country ranking); LGBTQ Equality Index (LGBTQ+: Russia Ukraine). Raw scores have been re-scaled to range from 0 to 1; the press freedom metric was also scaled such that a higher score is better.\nSome additional information to put these statistics into context.\n1. Russia is not just effectively a one-party state but a one-man state. Political opponents who are too powerful are jailed or killed. The only reason a neo-Nazi party doesn\u2019t exist in Russia is because Putin decides what kind of party gets to symbolically challenge him. Ukraine, for all its faults, is much more of a democracy.\n2. Even before the war, Russia systematically suppressed dissent, violently if necessary. Peaceful protests were \u201cnearly impossible.\u201d Ukraine has a long (albeit imperfect) history of peaceful protests and free speech.\n3. Russia has tight controls on the media and speech more generally. This has gotten (much) worse since the war. Ukraine\u2019s media freedom rating, while not great, was much better than Russia\u2019s, even before the war.\n4. Russia\u2019s regime has a proven track record of extreme nationalistic rhetoric. The linked article, from April 2021, ominously warns that Putin\u2019s \u201cincreasingly nationalistic rhetoric now risks triggering a major war, possibly against his wishes.\u201d Ukraine\u2019s government, by contrast, is focused on closer ties with the EU and the West more generally.\n5. Russia\u2019s 2013 law banning gay \u201cpropaganda\u201d and the accompanying rhetoric have marginalized LGBTQ individuals even more and led to more violence against them. The LGBTQ community in Ukraine is afraid of what will happen to them if Russia occupies the country.\nOf course, Ukraine can do even better. Closer ties with the West and the EU will help. But first, we need to do everything to help Ukraine win this war.

By contrast, Russia has a history of cultivating and collaborating with neo-Nazis, at home and abroad. Another great summary of Russia\u2019s support of neo-Nazi activity is here. In this article, I\u2019d like to tell you about a Russian ultra-nationalist white supremacy group called the Russian Imperial Movement (RIM). Unless otherwise noted, all the information below comes from Stanford University\u2019s \u201cMapping Militant Organizations\u201d project (RIM summary page; full report).\nIn 2020, RIM was designated by the US as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist, the first white supremacist group to be assigned this label. Yet RIM operates relatively openly in Russia and, although it does not receive any formal support from the regime, its operations have not been targeted or hampered by the government in any way. Nor is it on Russia\u2019s list of terrorist or extremist organizations.\nRIM was founded in 2002 and is based in St. Petersburg. It is anti-Semitic and anti-Ukrainian. More generally, it espouses an ideology of white supremacy and ethnic Russian nationalism and views European and US governments as enemies. As its name suggests, it also advocates the return to Russia\u2019s tsarist regime. In its early years, its activities were largely political: it worked with other far-right groups to form opposition parties and staged demonstrations. One of these attempts involved the creation of a nationalist party called the New Force, which, among other things proposed that only ethnic Russians should be allowed to immigrate to Russia and that undocumented immigrants should be put into labor camps before being deported.\nRIM became militarily active in 2014, when it saw opportunity in the then-new conflict in eastern Ukraine. It also started a military training program called \u201cPartizan\u201d (\u201cGuerilla\u201d). The main objective of Partizan is to train Russians in combat skills, but it is also happy to train foreign rightwing extremists. RIM claims to have trained and sent over 300 Russians to eastern Ukraine to fight alongside pro-Russian separatists in 2014\u20132016. Members of the Imperial Legion (the name of the militant wing) have also fought in Syria and Libya. In 2017, the Washington Post conducted an interview with a Partizan instructor, who spouted a lot of the same anti-Ukrainian sentiment currently being promoted by Putin.\nSince 2015, RIM has also collaborated and built ties with a variety of extreme-right organizations around the world in a variety of ways, including by sending its members to the US in 2017 to network with US neo-Nazis, attending a variety of far-right conferences, and, of course, providing military training through its Partizan program. In 2016\u20132017, two men who had trained in the Partizan program bombed a left-wing bookstore, a shelter for refugees, and a public campground that housed asylum seekers in Sweden. The prosecution cited training by RIM as a key step in their radicalization.\nTo be fair, RIM is neither huge nor mainstream. But it\u2019s important to shed light on what Putin allows to happen in his own country as he professes to \u201cdenazify\u201d others. Moreover, just as RIM was given a boost by the 2014 invasion of Crimea and Donbass, the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 may well strengthen it further, as it seems to have done with extreme right groups elsewhere. And while it would be wrong to deny that Ukraine is free from right-wing extremists, if the West helps Ukraine decisively win this war, the US and EU will be able to work with the Ukrainian government to ensure that these groups remain marginalized.

The connection between what we do and how we feel is well-studied and validated, and it makes sense that we feel much better when we do things we find enjoyable, productive, or relaxing as opposed to when we do things that are uncomfortable or unpleasant. Taking care of yourself (or \u2018doing self-care\u2019) can happen in small ways every day (ex. nourishing your body, connecting with loved ones, taking breaks) as well as in larger ways if/when we have the time, means, and capacity to do so (ex. taking time off from work and going on a week-long vacation).\nDoing self-care is undeniably a valuable component of our wellness, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s enough on its own to really cultivate a positive relationship with yourself and live a meaningful life. If you\u2019re doing all these nice things for yourself but still don\u2019t accept, understand, and care for who you are as a person, I think you\u2019ll only get so far. Imagine that you carry this overwhelming sense that you\u2019re not worthy of love or that you\u2019re defective in some way. Journaling in the morning, getting your nails done every week, and taking the occasional mental health day off from work as part of your self-care routine will certainly help you feel better on the surface, but how effective can these strategies really be on a deeper level? When we don\u2019t address our underlying thoughts, feelings, and relationships with ourselves, going through the motions of self-care can become much less meaningful and effective. It can also be harder to feel motivated enough to do self-care if you don\u2019t feel you deserve these good things in some way.\nSo while I don\u2019t want to discount doing healthy things for yourself, I do want to highlight how important it also is to be with yourself in healthier ways. We can define this latter concept as self-compassion, which I like to think of as self care\u2019s wiser older sister. Let\u2019s talk about what self-compassion actually entails and how we can become more compassionate with ourselves.\nWhat Self-Compassion Is And Is Not\nTo be compassionate with yourself essentially means to treat yourself with the same kindness, care, love, and respect that you would express towards others. Self-compassion involves three interrelated components:\nSelf-kindness (loving): being supportive, understanding, and caring towards ourselves when we are suffering or feel inadequate in some way\nCommon humanity (connected): recognizing that suffering is a shared and unavoidable human experience and we don\u2019t need to be alone in this experience\nMindfulness (presence): noticing and welcoming our thoughts, feelings, and body sensations in a non-judgmental way without over-identifying with them or avoiding them\n\u201cThrough self-compassion we become an inner ally instead of an inner enemy.\u201d -Dr. Kristin Neff\nBeing compassionate with yourself does not mean that you pity yourself, are weak, are self-centered or too self-involved, or that you can\u2019t hold yourself accountable for your actions and grow as a person. These misconceptions around self-compassion are largely rooted in Western societal and cultural norms and expectations that socialize us to believe things like:\nMen shouldn\u2019t have feelings or emotional needs\nWomen shouldn\u2019t be too self-absorbed or self-indulgent\nRacialized people shouldn\u2019t take up too much space\nTo get ahead in society, you must be better than others\nWhen we live in a society that teaches us certain identities or groups are better than others (ex. whiteness, being able bodied, being male, having a higher socioeconomic status), and we don\u2019t fall into these identities or groups, it can be incredibly difficult to feel good about ourselves. How good you feel about yourself (self-esteem), is a critical component of overall psychological well-being, but it does differ from self-compassion and it\u2019s important to understand this difference. While self-esteem involves evaluating yourself positively based on how you measure up to others or how successful you feel, self-compassion involves relating to yourself in a kind, non-judgmental, and accepting way regardless of the external circumstances and does not involve social comparison. Will it be easier for someone with high self-esteem to be self-compassionate? Probably. But is it also possible and important to care for and accept yourself while working towards liking who you are? Definitely.\nHow To Cultivate Self-Compassion\nWhile the idea of being kind to yourself may sound simple, it\u2019s not always easy to actually practice this as I\u2019m sure many of us can relate to (I know I definitely can). If you have ever had to be part of a system (family, school, work, society) where you weren\u2019t shown how to care for yourself or were taught that you\u2019re defective or not good enough, I see you and I want you to know that you are so worthy and deserving of compassion, understanding, kindness, care, love, and nurturing. You deserve these things from the people around you, and also from yourself. And you don\u2019t need to do anything to deserve this, you just do.\nHere are some suggestions of how to practice self-compassion across the different, connected parts of your emotional, cognitive, and physical experience:\nSelf-compassion in your mind:\nNotice your inner self-critic; explore what it\u2019s telling you, what its purpose is, and whether it\u2019s helping you or hurting you\nCreate distance between yourself and these critical thoughts; notice them and try to understand why they are showing up without over-identifying with them\nWork on building your inner self-compassionate voice; offer yourself reminders like \u201cI care about you,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m here for you,\u201d \u201cI love you\u201d when you need them\nTalk to yourself the way you would talk to a loved one\nSelf-compassion in your feelings:\nAcknowledge and hold space for your feelings as they come and go\nTry not to assign moral judgments to your feelings; recognize that they\u2019re not good or bad, but are simply giving you information about how you\u2019re doing and what you might need\nRecognize that unpleasant or uncomfortable feelings like pain, disappointment, hurt, and anger are all part of the shared universal experience of suffering; to have these feelings is to be human and you\u2019re not alone in feeling this way\nRespond to these unpleasant feelings with kindness and understanding rather than avoidance or judgment\nSelf-compassion in your body:\nExtend gratitude and appreciation towards the parts of your body that you are fond of (the parts that are working well, are strong, or that you find beautiful)\nExtend gratitude and sympathy towards the parts of your body that you are not so fond of; remind yourself that these parts are working hard too and deserve as much compassion and appreciation as the other parts\nTake care of, nourish, and hydrate your body\nAllow your body to rest when it needs to\nHow You Can Practice Self-Compassion Today\nI\u2019ll leave you with some affirmations to nurture self-compassion. Use these phrases as prompts for your personal journalling or meditative practices, or repeat them to yourself as you need (I like visual reminders more than verbal ones, so I personally find the most value in writing affirmations down on sticky notes and leaving them around my house so I can remember them throughout the day, but you decide what works best for you!):\nI deserve the same love and kindness I show to others\nI am worthy of good things\nWhen bad things happen to me, that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m a bad person\nI can\u2019t be compassionate towards others if I\u2019m not compassionate towards myself\nI\u2019m allowed to make mistakes\nI\u2019m allowed to have feelings\nI don\u2019t expect others to be perfect so I shouldn\u2019t expect myself to be perfect either\nIf you\u2019re interested in learning more about self-compassion and practicing self-compassion skills in your daily life, I would highly recommend working through \u201cThe Mindful Self-Compassion Workbook: A Proven Way to Accept Yourself, Build Inner Strength, and Thrive\u201d by Kristin Neff and Christopher Germer.

In my intakes with new clients who are starting therapy, I can\u2019t tell you how many folks tell me \u201csetting boundaries\u201d and \u201cworking on self-care\u201d are their main goals for therapy. What I often notice when I start working with clients on these things is that there seems to be a romanticized notion that \u2018once I say no and start prioritizing myself, everything will be wonderful and all of my problems will be solved.\u2019 I wish setting boundaries was so simple, but the truth is that setting boundaries often comes with a lot of discomfort, uncertainty, and pain (same goes with self-care, but that\u2019s a conversation for another day). These mixed feelings are very normal and don\u2019t mean that the boundaries you\u2019re trying to set are bad or wrong, just that change isn\u2019t easy and that giving yourself permission to enact boundaries is at times a complicated process.\nWhat Boundaries Are & Are Not\nLet\u2019s start with understanding what exactly boundaries are. In the simplest terms, boundaries are the personal capacities, limits, and rules we set for ourselves in the different parts of our lives. They are how we say \u201cno\u201d, \u201cthat doesn\u2019t work for me,\u201d \u201cnot right now,\u201d or \u201cI can\u2019t do that but what about this instead?\u201d Boundaries are not black and white \u2014 that is, it\u2019s not that we either have boundaries or we don\u2019t. Rather, we can have different types of boundaries in different parts of our lives, and some of these boundaries may be more rigid or porous than others. Boundaries also evolve and change over time as your feelings, needs, and values evolve and change over time, which means the act of setting boundaries in any given area of your life is more of an ongoing negotiation with yourself rather than a one-time event.\nIt\u2019s also important to understand that boundaries are about our own actions, not the actions of others. For example, imagine that you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed at work and would like to improve your work-life balance. Some boundaries you could set include: (1) letting your colleagues know you\u2019re not available on weekends, (2) deleting the email app from your phone so you don\u2019t check work emails outside of work, or (3) not doing any extra work on evenings/weekends. These are all examples of boundaries because they are all things that you can control. They are all ways that you are limiting your engagement with your job outside of work hours.\nTrying to control or change others\u2019 behaviours however would not be an effective way to enact boundaries. For example, asking your colleagues not to email you over the weekend may not be a realistic or effective boundary in this situation because deciding whether they would like to work on weekends is up to them. You can\u2019t always control their attempts to access you, but you can always control how you choose to be accessible (or not) to them. You can certainly request that other people respect and act in accordance with your boundaries, but even if they don\u2019t, you can still maintain these boundaries through your own actions. For example, let\u2019s say you\u2019ve set your initial boundary by letting your colleagues know you\u2019re not available on weekends, and have also requested that your colleagues wait until Monday morning to email you, but one of your colleagues continues to email you over the weekend. You can continue to maintain your boundaries in this situation by simply waiting until Monday to respond.\nThis is not to say that the actions of others don\u2019t matter at all when it comes to our personal boundaries \u2014 what we observe around us definitely influences our comfort levels around setting our own boundaries, or what type of boundaries we choose to set. For example, if everyone at your job works 24/7, it may be much harder for you to set different boundaries for yourself. This is why it\u2019s very difficult for people who come from enmeshed families, who have not had healthy or clear boundaries modelled for them, to then set boundaries for themselves. Different cultures also value different things, so the ease with which you are able to set boundaries in certain areas of your life will also be influenced by what has been modelled for you in a larger societal context. For example, Japan has historically had a culture of overworking, which has made it very difficult for individual workers to take time away from work in order to comply with societal expectations and standards. In fact, the Japanese term karoshi was coined in the 1970s to describe the phenomenon of workers literally dying from overworking.\nSetting limits for yourself and expressing these limits to others around you are very normal and healthy things to do and having boundaries in different areas of your life will benefit you in different ways. For example, having boundaries at work may prevent you from experiencing burnout and having boundaries in your personal relationships may prevent you from feeling emotionally drained. At this point, I think it\u2019s fair to say that boundaries are good and typically benefit us in some way. That said, you may notice it\u2019s not always fun, easy, or comfortable to actually set boundaries in your life. When you choose not to check your work emails over the weekend for example, many people find this creates a feeling of discomfort that we may label as guilt. So if boundaries are so good, why do they make us feel so guilty sometimes?\nHealthy Vs. Unhealthy Guilt\nWhen it comes to guilt, it\u2019s important to understand that different types of guilt arise for different reasons. On the one hand, we have helpful guilt. Helpful guilt arises when we\u2019ve done something that\u2019s objectively bad or wrong. This type of guilt is considered healthy because it alerts us to the fact that we\u2019ve done something wrong and gives us the opportunity to repair the damage that we\u2019ve caused. For example, if you\u2019re in a monogamous relationship and cheat on your partner, you would feel healthy guilt because infidelity in a monogamous relationship is objectively wrong.\nThe other type of guilt we can experience is called unhelpful guilt, which arises when your actions don\u2019t meet the unrealistically high standards or expectations that you\u2019ve set for yourself (that you likely wouldn\u2019t hold anyone else accountable to). This type of guilt is considered unhealthy because it typically leads to self-critical thoughts and self-punishing behaviours without any productive behaviour change. For example, if you consider yourself a good friend and then miss a friend\u2019s phone call one day when you\u2019re not feeling well, you may feel unhealthy guilt because you haven\u2019t lived up to your own unrealistically high standards of what being a good friend means.\nUnderstanding which type of guilt you\u2019re experiencing is important because different actions are needed to deal with each type. Healthy guilt is resolved by making amends, apologizing, or trying to right your wrongdoing in some way. For example, if you feel guilty about cheating on your partner you could resolve this feeling of healthy guilt by being honest about your infidelity and apologizing to them. Unhealthy guilt on the other hand doesn\u2019t get resolved in the same way because when you feel unhealthy guilt you haven\u2019t really done anything wrong that you need to apologize for. Unhealthy guilt can actually only be resolved by challenging the unhelpful standards you\u2019ve set for yourself and correcting the self-critical and self-punishing beliefs and behaviours that follow. For example, if you feel guilty for missing your friend\u2019s phone call, you could resolve this unhealthy guilt by reminding yourself that you don\u2019t need to always be available to answer your friends\u2019 calls in order to be a good friend. You could exercise self-compassion and remind yourself that it\u2019s okay to take care of yourself too.\nUnhealthy Guilt & Boundaries\nWhen we set boundaries, the type of guilt that often arises is unhealthy guilt. This is because setting boundaries isn\u2019t objectively bad or wrong, it\u2019s actually a very good and healthy thing to do. However, saying no often doesn\u2019t align with the unrealistically high standards and expectations that many people set for themselves around their availability, capacity, and accessibility to others. So when we do start saying no or limiting how available we are to others at times, this behaviour may be very incongruent with how we see ourselves and our value to others.\nNot only does our internal voice tell us that we did something wrong by setting a boundary, but we may expect or perceive that others also don\u2019t like the boundary we\u2019ve set. Since setting boundaries often means saying \u201cno\u201d to others, it\u2019s not unusual that the reactions we get (or expect to get) from others to our boundaries may not always be the most positive. No one wants to be told no, especially if they expect you to always say yes. This combination of our own internal self-critical beliefs and the perceived negative reactions of others leads to the feeling of unhealthy guilt. In situations like this where we haven\u2019t really done anything wrong but we feel like we have, we may start to regret setting a boundary in the first place. Often, we tell ourselves that we\u2019re letting both ourselves and others down when we do.\n\u201cDaring to set boundaries is about having the courage to love ourselves, even when we risk disappointing others.\u201d -Bren\u00e9 Brown\nRemember that unhealthy guilt doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ve done something wrong \u2014 it means you\u2019re being too hard on yourself. If you notice this feeling of unhealthy guilt arises when you try to set a boundary, it may be worth exploring and challenging the unrealistic expectations and standards that you have set for yourself. You might ask yourself, \u201cWhy do I not deserve what I would encourage in others?\u201d Setting boundaries is an act of self-love and self-care, not something you\u2019re doing to disappoint others. And if others are disappointed at times when you say no and choose yourself first, then it may be worth learning how to tolerate some of this discomfort in order to live a life that really feels meaningful for you, which in my opinion is something that everyone deserves.\nThe next time you feel guilty for setting a boundary, I\u2019ll invite you to try working through that unhealthy guilt by:\n(1) Recognizing what makes this guilt unhealthy (ask yourself questions like, \u201cis anything I did objectively bad?\u201d, \u201cwould someone else looking at this objectively think I did something bad?\u201d) \n(2) Labelling which unrealistic expectations/standards you\u2019re holding yourself to and giving yourself permission to let go of these if you can \n(3) Reminding yourself of your values, feelings, and needs that informed this boundary in the first place, and why this matters to you \n(4) Being patient and compassionate with yourself as you learn what your boundaries are and how to express them \n(5) Remembering that you\u2019re not responsible for managing how other people react to your boundaries but you are responsible for advocating for your own needs \n(6) Continuing to practice!

Clients tell me how heavily their parents\u2019 disappointment weighs on them whenever they even think about making decisions that their parents might disapprove of, let alone take actions towards those decisions (that would be truly unimaginable). It feels like they must constantly choose between the discomfort of doing what they want at their parents\u2019 expense or doing what their parents want at their own expense. After recognizing that neither of these are ideal options, they almost always tell me that choosing themselves feels harder because of the immense feelings of shame and guilt that they know would follow. When you choose to disappoint yourself instead of your parents, at least this is something that only impacts you, and some part of us tells us that this means it\u2019s easier to deal with (spoiler \u2014 it\u2019s not).\nCognitive Dissonance and the Immigrant Experience\nTo make sense of and deal with this discomfort, we need to first understand why it\u2019s so uncomfortable. Psychologically, we feel \u201ccognitive dissonance\u201d when our actions, beliefs, and values don\u2019t align in some way. For example, if you value honesty and then lie to someone, you will probably feel uncomfortable because your actions are not in line with your values. If this happens once, you might have the thought that \u201cif honesty is good and lying is bad, then I did something bad.\u201d But when we consistently do things that are not in line with our values or beliefs, the story we start to tell ourselves becomes \u201cif honesty is good and lying is bad, then I am someone bad.\u201d The intensity of this discomfort depends on a range of factors including but not limited to:\ni.) The importance of the value: is honesty a core value or something that\u2019s less important?\nii.) The degree of misalignment: did you tell a white lie or betray someone\u2019s trust irrevocably?\niii.) The consequences of your actions: did someone else witness this and do they now also think you\u2019re a bad person?\nCognitive dissonance is unfortunately a common experience for many immigrants because the nature of immigration itself means often having to integrate conflicting values from the home country that one is leaving and the new country one is coming to. Now, I\u2019m not suggesting that non-immigrants don\u2019t also experience cognitive dissonance from time to time because this is a universal experience. What I am suggesting though is that cultural values inform societal norms, and if your family shares the same values as the society you live in, it will probably be much easier for you to uphold these same values and follow societal norms too. For example, the individualistic Canadian norm of young adults moving out of their parents\u2019 home to attend university or college around age 18 means it\u2019s not uncommon for most non-immigrant, Canadian children to separate from their parents at that time. Not only does our society tell these kids that this is normal, but so do their parents. This unified messaging often leads to confident decision making and self-assuredness.\nLet\u2019s compare that to the experience of 1st or 2nd generation children whose families more recently immigrated to Canada from collectivistic countries where the norm is to live in the family home until marriage. So, while Canadian society also tells these kids that moving away from home for school is normal, their parents and their home culture often don\u2019t corroborate this message. This mixed messaging then leads to self-doubt, anxiety, confusion, and a fragmented sense of self. If the individual in this situation wants to move away for school, a state of cognitive dissonance occurs and they might start to believe that \u201cIf I want to do something that my parents think is wrong, I must be a bad daughter.\u201d Because the values of independence and interdependence are so conflicting, it can feel impossible to live a life that is in line with both sets of values. On a macro level, to choose one means to reject the other and to integrate into the new culture means to leave behind the old culture completely. On a micro level, to live for yourself means to disappoint your parents.\nStepping Into Your Bicultural Identity\nYou can reduce or eliminate cognitive dissonance by either changing your values and beliefs to line up better with your behaviours, or by changing your behaviours to line up better with your values and beliefs. Understanding what you value and why this matters to you is a crucial first step. For immigrants whose personal values will be influenced by two sets of cultural values, this means figuring out which values from each culture you want to integrate into your personal value system \u2014 the very definition of developing a bicultural identity. Forcing yourself to either accept or reject either culture completely (like I\u2019ve noticed many immigrants tend to do, especially in earlier stages of the acculturation process) is just not feasible for most people. Recognizing that it\u2019s okay and normal to value certain things more or less than your parents do because of your unique lived experiences growing up in the space between two cultural identities will be an important part of this process.\nOnce you have a clearer sense of what you value, it should be much easier to figure out what behaviours would align best with these values. At this point, you might be noticing that you do value some or maybe even a lot of the same things as your parents but still feel some tension or misalignment between yourself and them. It\u2019s important to understand that it\u2019s possible to value the same things as your parents, but to perhaps live out and express these values in different ways at different times. For example, maybe your parents show they value family by spending all of their free time with family members, whereas maybe you show that you value family by providing emotional support to your family and being there for them during difficult times. One of these is not better or worse ways to live out this value than the other \u2014 they are simply different. With compassion, patience, and understanding towards yourself, what needs to happen is unlearning some of the internalized core beliefs that tell you that you are a bad person for living out your values in the ways that make the most sense for you. It\u2019s always okay to choose yourself.\n\u201cYour parents are not meant to be the antagonists of your story. But they\u2019re also not the authors\u201d \u2014 Sahaj Kohli\nIf you are struggling with this, I\u2019ll leave you with some questions I often ask my clients in therapy to begin this process of unlearning and relearning:\n\u00b7 Does it make you a bad person to want differently for yourself than your parents do?\n\u00b7 At what expense do you have a \u2018good\u2019 relationship with your parents right now? What parts of yourself do you have to hide to make this happen?\n\u00b7 How sustainable is it for you to continue giving up your own needs? Imagine your life in 5 years. If it\u2019s this painful now, how painful will it be then?\n\u00b7 Think of a specific value you share with your parents. How do they live out this value, and how do you live out this value?\n\u00b7 Think of something you value that your parent\u2019s don\u2019t. Why is this something that\u2019s important to you? Could you imagine just not caring about this anymore?\nPersonally, I find it easy at times to lose sight of the bigger picture regarding navigating an often challenging bicultural identity. What I remind myself in moments like this are that my family did not uproot their lives and move across an ocean for me to be unhappy.

Photo from the Facebook page of the SES of Ukraine.\nThe main product of our company helps people from many countries learn Java online and become developers. Right before the war started, things looked pretty good for us. The number of users was growing, and we were working on a new product called Java University. We had ambitious plans: after the launch of the free version in China, the EU, and the USA, we started preparing the content for the paid version. We were also thinking about creating a platform that would connect students learning Java with mentors who can help them solve problems. We were considering attracting investments and expanding quickly and widely. All our ideas seemed so exciting, and the future looked so bright.\nWe had heard the news about Russian troops near our borders, and we were feeling tension and anxiety. But, as strange as it may sound, since 2014 (when Russia started sending its troops to the eastern regions of Ukraine and annexed Crimea), we have gotten used to these emotions and the danger coming from our so-called \u201cneighbor\u201d. We hoped for the best. None of us thought such madness could happen.\nI live (I don\u2019t want to say \u201clived\u201d) in Kyiv, on the left bank of the Dnipro river. On February 24th, around 5 am, I woke up because of sounds I\u2019d never heard before: shots or explosions. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s nothing,\u201d I said to myself. But then came the next ones. I reached for my phone. The news was overwhelming: many Ukrainian cities under attack, missiles flying, bombings. It was the end of my plans for the day \u2014 and the beginning of our new reality.\nDuring the next several days, I stayed in Kyiv and tried to connect with my colleagues. Some of them left the city for the villages in the suburbs; others were running much further. People were worried about money and the future. My employees kept asking me: what if I left? Would I be able to work? Would the company survive?\nMy wife was also asking me whether we should leave or not. I didn\u2019t know what to do. But then our army shot down the cruise missile, and it fell one block from our house. So, we decided to leave Kyiv. My parents refused to go with us. \u201cIt\u2019s our city, and we\u2019ll stay with it,\u201d they said.\nOne more photo of the ruined house near my own. Taken from 24tv.ua\nAfter leaving Kyiv and finding a safer place, I had to act fast to keep the business afloat. This huge task required several steps.\nSafety\nWe made sure our employees also came to safe (or at least safer) places. Today, every Ukrainian has a story: scary, tragic, and sad. Our employees do too. Some of their stories are very unusual. For example, one of our colleagues left Kyiv for Vynnytsya (the city in the center of Ukraine) by bicycle. In a single day, he rode 50 km, found a place to stay in some village, worked for several hours, and resumed the journey the next day. Ukrainians are unbreakable!\nTools\nWe did our best to provide all the devices people need to work. Some of the employees managed to take laptops from the office (luckily, we had some there). Several PCs at the office still are on, so our developers can connect to them through the internal network. The main infrastructure is in AWS, and the servers are located in Germany and the USA. So, our products are stable and work without any problems.\nMost of our employees have been using mobile internet since the war started. Their smartphones have become access points, and it allows them to work.\nCommunication\nSure, there were some communication problems as our people were spread around Ukraine and abroad. For example, our designer is still in the village near Kyiv. She has a laptop, but the internet connection is awful. She found a spot with a slightly better signal \u2014 and has to go there whenever she needs to send or receive some files. And it often takes a long time.\nResuming work\nDespite all the difficulties, we resumed work. We want to strive and continue paying out salaries even in these terrible circumstances. But because of the war, we lost a big part of our income. So, we needed new ideas. We met online and started brainstorming. Maybe the reason was the adrenaline rush, but we came up with solutions very quickly.\nFor example, we started a promo campaign with no closing date: 50% discount on our Java course. We are very grateful to all the people from Europe and the USA who are buying subscriptions. They help us support our employees who had to leave their lives behind and keep our company alive. Our biggest fear is closing the business we\u2019ve put all our efforts and hearts in. Our old and new clients are saving us from the worst scenario.\nBefore the war, we were actively expanding to the Chinese market, and now we\u2019re still pursuing this goal.\nAlso, we decided to launch Java University. Instead of 12 months, as we initially planned, we\u2019re offering three months course, \u201cJava Fundamentals\u201d, with mentors\u2019 support. We hope it will increase our revenue and stabilize our financial state.\nMental health\nWe knew our people were experiencing enormous stress and wanted to help them cope. Our game designer is also an expert in psychology. So, to support our employees, we conducted sessions at the end of every meeting. Everyone could share their emotions, fears, and thoughts. It made people feel they weren\u2019t alone and lowered their anxiety.\nIt\u2019s everyone\u2019s fight\nToday, all of us keep helping the country to fight. Ukraine must defend itself on two battlefields: physical and informational. We are trying to do as much as we can on both. As early as possible, we sent emails to our users in several languages (Polish, English, German, etc.) with information about the current situation and ways to help Ukraine. We assured them we\u2019d continue supporting our products, so they could learn Java regardless of where they were. After all, we need to stay in business to rebuild the Ukrainian economy after our victory!\nThe response we\u2019d gotten extremely touched us. Our customers from numerous countries were writing to us offering help. They even suggested accommodating our employees! It felt like our users stood with us and supported us at the darkest time. They gave us faith that we could survive, stay together, and keep our business.\nScreenshots from our support team show the reaction of our users to the letter about the situation in Ukraine.\nThen, we focused our efforts on three projects:\nDonor.ua \u2014 his project accumulates information about blood donors all over Ukraine and coordinates the blood donating process. We\u2019re helping them with the advertisement for potential donors and money collection. This organization needs funding, and we\u2019re doing everything we can to attract foreign investments.\nThe project \u201c\u041c\u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0440\u0443\u0447\u201d (\u201cWe\u2019re near\u201d) \u2014 provides psychological support for children during the war. Kids are very vulnerable today. They may be scared of hearing sounds of alarm sirens, or explosions, staying in bomb shelters for days, seeing terrible things. This project connects children with therapists.\nDostupno.ua \u2014 The project which purpose is to evacuate people with disabilities from hot spots.\nAlso, many employees join different volunteer projects by themselves and help spread the information about what\u2019s really going on. Many of our team members are helping the army and refugees with medicine, equipment, etc.\nYesterday, we were developers, designers, and managers. We lived our ordinary lives: worked, went for lunch with colleagues, made Friday night plans with friends, and booked tickets for the next trip somewhere.\nToday, everyone in our company is not just an employee but also a volunteer.

This question is the source of numerous discussions, expert opinions, and books. Nevertheless, we don\u2019t have an answer yet. I decided to find my own, based on my professional experience (I\u2019m the co-founder and the CMO at CodeGym.cc, the company with over 2.5 million users) and personal path.\nI\u2019ve been in professional Finswimming for over eight years now. I\u2019ve taken part in numerous competitions in Ukraine and abroad. I even took part in two Finswimming World Cups, in Serbia and Hungary, where I came fourth and fifth. I\u2019ve invested so much time and effort in this activity, so it\u2019s become a part of who I am. It shaped my personality and helped me to learn multiple lessons. Surprisingly, they turned out to be extremely valuable for my business and product management in particular. In this article, I\u2019m sharing these lessons with you.\nWhy do I think my personal experience matters? Because it\u2019s not just mine. Mark Zuckerberg was a fencing star in high school. Whole Foods ex-CEO Walter Robb was the captain of the soccer team back at Stanford. Also, I read about the survey Ernst&Young conducted several years ago. They found out that 96% of women in C-level executive positions used to play sports. Of course, it doesn\u2019t mean that every athlete is an efficient entrepreneur, but it looks like there\u2019s a certain connection between sports and skills that managers can benefit from. And although I\u2019m not a researcher, I tried to summarize what Finswimming taught me \u2014 and how I\u2019m using it in my work.\n1. Surround yourself with the best people\nIt will stimulate you to grow and achieve better results.\nWhen I was in the third grade, I was diagnosed with asthma. Also, my allergy was progressing. The doctors suggested that I start taking swimming lessons to help develop my lungs. At first, my parents brought me to the beginners\u2019 group. Its purpose was just to teach kids how to swim. Nobody was expecting us to become champions. I was among the weakest kids there. Learning to swim wasn\u2019t easy for me. It took almost a year. But when I started to notice my first small successes, I felt a genuine interest.\nSuddenly I understood that I wanted to swim faster than the others. I enjoyed starting the exercise last but finishing it the first. Soon, my coach saw my progress and recommended transferring me to the advanced group.\nThe kids there were much more trained. Some of them had already been participating in competitions or preparing for them. I was looking up to them and tried to become better, too. In time, I started to swim faster than everyone in my group. And the next step for me was to enter the professional swimming club.\nAgain, I found myself in a new challenging environment. Everyone was five or six years older than me, and almost everyone was better. At first. But as I badly wanted to become the best, I already could swim faster than some of the older boys in several months. Also, it came as a surprise that I\u2019m capable of winning prizes in championships. I became one of the strongest swimmers in my city and region. And I owe it to this approach: aspire for the best.\nLater, as an adult, I understood that the same principle applies to management. You can\u2019t grow if you\u2019re among people who are much weaker than you. Instead, if your peers and subordinates are smarter (faster, more educated, etc.) than you \u2014 it\u2019s an opportunity to become better.\nOf course, it requires humility to accept that you may not be \u201cthe fastest kid in the group\u201d. But the result is worth it.\n2. Listen to professionals even if you are sure you\u2019re right\nOnce, trying to achieve even better results, my friend and I decided to start exercising by ourselves in addition to all the training we had with our coach. Sometimes we had several workouts in one day. But it turned out that it didn\u2019t make us better. Instead, our results worsened because we put too much pressure on our muscles. Moreover, I even got injured while lifting a big weight, which threw me back.\nI recall this story occasionally, especially when I don\u2019t like to hear what a colleague tells me and feel tempted to do it my way. Then I ask myself: do I trust this person\u2019s expertise? If the answer is positive, I consider my colleague\u2019s opinion.\n3. Be persistent in achieving your goals (even when something\u2019s going wrong)\nAfter many years of training, I wanted to earn the title \u201cMaster of sports\u2019\u2019 (MS). To get it, you have to demonstrate specific results (high speed of swimming) at the national-level competition. It seemed easy: after all, I was already swimming this fast and showed the required speed at every training. I was sure that I\u2019d do the same at the competition.\nBut the reality was different. I was too nervous, there were too many people\u2026 And I failed. It took me almost a year to earn the desired title.\nWe often make the same mistake in product management: we create an MVP (a minimum viable product) and assume the target audience will love it, and we\u2019ll scale it quickly and flawlessly. But then harsh realities bring us back to where we started. And if we\u2019re not persistent, we\u2019ll lose.\n4. Allow yourself to make mistakes\nProfessional athletes know the value of a good mistake. It teaches you never to give up, analyze your past, prepare for the future, and eventually get better.\nDoing business requires the same attitude. If you made a mistake and never learned from it, you really failed. If you learned your lesson, you won, even if your outcomes are far from great so far.\n5. Keep your focus, plan, and stay organized\nIn high school, I had to combine swimming with studying and preparing for the university entrance exams. Instead of focusing on just sports, I wanted to achieve educational success, too. I had to learn how to plan my time. For example, I got up at 5:45 am, and I had my first training at 6:45 am. The school started at 8:30 am. Then I had lunch and went to the training course at the university that I planned to apply to. And at 9 pm, I had my second training at the pool.\nSometimes it felt like a too heavy load for one person. But, at the same time, this regimen taught me to always be on time and focus on a single task to avoid distractions. This skill is sometimes called \u201cmental toughness\u201d. It allows professional athletes to go on even when they are extremely tired or demotivated.\nThis skill is precious for a manager. You can\u2019t achieve real success overnight. Creating a product requires taking time, planning, and staying focused. It\u2019s a marathon, not a sprint. So, every manager can benefit from developing mental toughness. To do it, accept new challenges and try to keep your focus under the pressure they create.\n6. Balance your work and life outside the office\nMy coach used to say: \u201cThe best results are born from the right combination of work and rest\u201d. Our muscles and neural connections need this change of pace to grow most efficiently. You can\u2019t keep putting more and more load on your body without allowing it to rest. Otherwise, you\u2019ll get injured.\nThe same is true for the work-life balance. If you\u2019ve been working intensively for a long time without proper rest, you\u2019ll be at the risk of burnout. That\u2019s why even in weeks when I have to work 10\u201312 hours a day, I dedicate at least one day to non-work-related activities. It helps to switch focus and, therefore, get energized.\nBurnout is a serious problem, and the IT industry is not an exception. According to the survey conducted by Indeed, over the past year, the situation has worsened. In 2021, 52% of employees were feeling burned out. 67% of them think this feeling has gotten worse since the beginning of the pandemic.\nSo, today this lesson is vital: maintain the work-life balance and help your employees to do the same. Notice the first signs of burnout in yourself and the people around you, and act upon them. Have some rest, give an employee an extra day-off, take a short trip, etc.\n7. Retain confidence\nAny type of success, in sports or business, would be impossible without feeling confident and taking risks. You have to make decisions and often do it quickly and under a lot of pressure. I\u2019m not a big fan of the old proverb \u201cWhoever doesn\u2019t risk never gets to drink champagne\u201d. I rather believe that facts and analysis should support every decision. But when it comes to trying something new or implementing changes, facts and analysis mean nothing without confidence and willingness to take risks.\n8. Take responsibility\nIn sports, there\u2019s no one to blame for your failures and no one to praise for your successes except for yourself. In business, we sometimes can\u2019t follow this rule. We blame our competitors or an economic situation. But this attitude won\u2019t bring us anywhere closer to our goals. If we want to succeed, we need to take full responsibility for our actions and outcomes.\n9. Strengthen teamwork\nAlthough swimming isn\u2019t a group activity, still, it taught me how to be a part of the team. You have to listen to your coach and teammates, communicate your opinion, and conduct a dialogue.\nWhile working as a product manager, I understood that the value of the team is the most significant value you own. A weak team means an ineffective product. A strong team with solid communicational skills equals a strong product with precise positioning.\n10. Act\nIt may sound trivial, but some people dream while others act. Guess who wins?\nSo, both in sports and business, it\u2019s crucial not to hesitate. If you have confidence, support from your team, and a clear vision, then act.\nAnd there\u2019ll be nothing that can stop you.", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 43, "created_time": 1643295955401, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Management", "Management And Leadership", "Personal Development", "Personal Growth"]}, {"author": "Alex Yelenevych", "post_id": "4f4c9e34fa9a", "user_id": "dcd4a792444f", "title": "Building Business Community: Focus on Cooperation, Not Competition", "content": "Building Business Community: Focus on Cooperation, Not Competition\nBy turning rivals into partners, we can find strength in numbers\n\nToday\u2019s world looks a bit like Wonderland: what seemed impossible just yesterday will be old news tomorrow. New companies, products, and markets appear faster than we can say the word \u201cchange\u201d.\nIn these circumstances, it\u2019s no wonder that most of us agree with the saying, \u201ccompetition drives the market\u201d. Unfortunately, however, we often act as if competitors are our enemies.\nI\u2019m a co-founder of a company in the ultra-competitive online education market, with more than 2.5 million users in multiple countries. So while I\u2019m familiar with the concept of competition \u2014 I\u2019m not naive \u2014 I\u2019m convinced that organizations should be afraid of internal problems rather than other companies. From my experience, the business community can strengthen its every member if we build it on cooperation, not competition.\nWho\u2019s the real enemy?\nNowadays, we try to solve problems by negotiating; many books and experts still compare business to war. Competition is often a lifestyle: people compete for higher grades, better things, and bigger salaries. Competition became an integral part of society due to historical, cultural, and other factors. Everyone\u2019s an enemy, and this point of view remains dominant among business owners and CEOs.\nMaybe in the past, it was helpful to think of competitors as foes, but the modern world is so interconnected that this perspective doesn\u2019t allow us to see new opportunities, stands in the way of improving, and, as a result, weakens our products.\nIt\u2019s been nine years since we started building CodeGym.cc from scratch. And while we were going along this path, we were making mistakes and learning from them. Knowing everything I\u2019ve gained, I think that the main enemies of any business are:\nA wrong strategy: Sometimes, entrepreneurs pay too much attention to competitors\u2019 strategies and try to create \u201csomething different\u201d instead of focusing on their own vision. At other times, they just copy someone else\u2019s strategy and try to implement it.\nA weak product: If your product is strong (and you deeply understand your customers\u2019 needs and address them in the right way), there are fewer reasons to be afraid of the competition.\nA poorly organized or unqualified team: If your employees lack hard or soft skills, can\u2019t communicate well, don\u2019t stick to team goals, and manage their time inefficiently, even the right strategy won\u2019t work as expected.\nPoor marketing or sales: This happens when we don\u2019t properly understand our clients, choose the channels poorly, don\u2019t pay attention to customer experience or have a strong sales team. In that case, it\u2019s not our competitors\u2019 fault.\nInefficient processes and lack of efficiency among employees: No business can succeed long-term if its processes are too complicated, too slow, or unoptimized.\nOf course, this isn\u2019t a complete list. There are a lot of mental traps that business owners and executives can fall into. Many organizational issues are obstacles to building a better business (or becoming a better manager). But there\u2019s one common thing amongst them: it\u2019s not about competition.\nIf we want to find an enemy, we should look within. The best use of our resources isn\u2019t to fight someone (in our head or on the market) but rather to invest in growth, creation, and development.\nMake products, not war.\nFrom competing to cooperating\nIf that\u2019s the case, what\u2019s the role of our competitors?\nCompetitiveness is natural for humans and one of the biggest motivators. When you see something great, you want to create a masterpiece, too. When you see someone improving, you\u2019ll likely make more effort yourself. Competition can drive creativity if we look at it healthily.\nBut what does healthy competitiveness mean? For me, it looks like a partnership. Adam Brandenburger and Barry Nalebuff introduced the term \u201ccoopetition\u201d, which is a combination of cooperation and competition and which is used to refer to when rivals work together to achieve a common goal.\nThis partnership can be short-term or long-term and can focus on one or several areas. There are multiple examples of this concept in the modern business world. For instance, in 2008, UPS agreed to ship DHL\u2019s packages (because DHL couldn\u2019t do it at the time and asked a competitor for help). Companies from the same market can share technologies, like Ford and GM did in 2013 with the transmission, consult each other, or lend a hand when there\u2019s a supply shortage. Of course, it\u2019s not pure altruism, and both sides usually get something out of the collaboration. But it\u2019s more than just an exchange; such partnerships often generate synergy for the whole market. Everybody wins, including the competitors, the customers, and the suppliers.\nThe power of community\nBuilding a business community is also a win-win. Informal gatherings, regular communication, and even exchanging ideas with companies from the same market are common in developed countries. The community can often help entrepreneurs to make important decisions or solve problems.\nAt the beginning of the 2010s, Airbnb faced a major challenge. It quickly and successfully grew in the USA, but it was yet to enter the European market. At the same time, the Samwer brothers, who were former Facebook investors, noticed a promising venture and created a similar website. It wasn\u2019t their first time: earlier, they\u2019d made a clone of eBay \u2014 a service called Alando \u2014 and sold it to eBay for $43m.\nIt was their typical strategy: create a similar service and sell it to the \u201coriginal\u201d American company. Airbnb was the Samwer brothers\u2019 next target. They built a website called Wimdu which looked a lot like Airbnb, then offered it to Airbnb in exchange for 25% of its shares.\nThis choice wasn\u2019t easy to make: if the company declined the offer, it had to compete with the clone in a foreign market and invest huge amounts of money to build a European branch from scratch. Brian Chesky (co-founder of Airbnb) and his executive team tried to develop a plan, but they couldn\u2019t find a solution. Then Brian turned to Andrew Mason, CEO of Groupon, who\u2019d been in the same situation before and who\u2019d eventually decided to buy the clone (a service called CityDeal). Brian also asked for Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s opinion (he voted to decline the offer) and consulted with other experts.\nCollecting and processing different thoughts helped Brian to make up his mind. He decided to fight, declined the Samwer brothers\u2019 offer, and expanded Airbnb into Europe by himself. It was the right decision, and the help from the business community played a large part in it.\nBuilding a strong business community is beneficial for all members. My colleagues and I meet with teams from other IT companies to discuss various issues, organize meetups and share our experiences. For example, we recently visited the office of a popular IT company that created productivity apps and was one of the pioneers on AppStore. We talked to the team and discussed the company\u2019s values, the scaling of their products, remote work, and more. This experience gave something valuable to both companies, including plenty of insights and new connections.\nLater, I wrote a post about the visit on my Telegram channel, and I suddenly started to receive invitations from other companies. One of them was from a digital platform that connects sellers and customers. Again, my colleagues and I visited their office and facilities, and we even joined a closed meeting of several teams as they discussed that month\u2019s results and their plans for the next one. This experience solidified my opinion: we\u2019re willing to put our effort into building the business community because it generates enormous value for everyone involved.\nSharing is caring\nEven great entrepreneurs are sometimes scared to talk about their experiences, and that fear can become a significant obstacle to building a solid community.\nIt\u2019s time to get rid of this fear. Start writing articles, releasing podcasts, giving talks at conferences, and sharing your mistakes and victories. Share what you\u2019ve learned and seen and tell your community about your lessons and conclusions. Embrace your imperfection and let other people and companies extract value from it. It will enrich our lives, businesses, and markets and make our brands stronger.\nAnd maybe we are ready for it. Recently, I initiated research on the role of product managers in one of our local markets. We asked IT companies to join us and share their data. The results exceeded all our expectations. We have received over 400 questionnaires with answers from product managers of top products, many of which are known all over the world \u2014 Readdle, Grammarly, MacPaw, Reface, Genesis, etc.\nMoreover, we also had 20+ interviews with CEOs and founders. They were willing to talk openly about corporate culture, the onboarding process, product managers\u2019 goals, etc. Are they all competitors? In some way, yes. But they were happy to share their knowledge and invest in the community. To me, it\u2019s a sign of the business community emerging, and I\u2019m happy to be a part of it.\nAfter all, it\u2019s much more interesting to hear about mistakes than another story about \u201csuccessful success\u201d.", "comment_count": 2, "like_count": 214, "created_time": 1636733252186, "comment": [{"user_id": "dcd4a792444f", "comment_time": 1636733252186, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "b211d8c64a77", "comment_time": 1640031777861, "comment": "Great piece Alex full of valuable insights.

You have to be kind,\u201d I spoke into the phone to my father. We talk every day now, sometimes half a dozen times (the other half dozen I let go to voicemail so I can work). Most of the time he screams, cursing, demanding whatever new item he\u2019s fixated upon: the cable bill for the house he\u2019s not living in, his jacket (though he can\u2019t leave the nursing facility due to COVID lockdown), getting the lawn mowed.\n\u201cI just want the neighbor\u2019s number. I have a pen here \u2014 \u201d\n\u201cNo, Dad. I won\u2019t give it to you again. He doesn\u2019t want you to call anymore.\u201d\nPeople around the old neighborhood have blocked my father\u2019s phone number anyway, finally getting overwhelmed by his constant calls, the swearing fits, his forgetting he\u2019d called and calling again.\nHe is baffled over why the neighbor doesn\u2019t want his calls. He denies that he\u2019s ever shouted at him. He can\u2019t remember.\nI was seventeen when I moved away to college. Since middle school, I\u2019d set my mind on getting the best grades I could in order to one day earn enough scholarships to get myself out of our small town and my family\u2019s house. My father was an active alcoholic until I was most of the way through college. Active probably isn\u2019t the right word, but his energy was more frenetic, more assuredly terrifying. He got sober the year I turned 21. He nearly died from the whiskey and beer poison he consumed from waking until passing out each day. My mother detoxed him at home.\nOnce he was sober, for years, he still visited his usual bar every day and had a ginger ale. He even sat on the same barstool as during his drinking days. He defied any advice from AA or the rehabilitation that had previously failed to stick. His temper endured, though he himself was in more fragile form. My world expanded. The place I grew up was no longer where I called home.\nI read a few books that advised setting boundaries, not enabling bad behaviors. Moving farther away solved a lot of the problem. The stability of a life filled with carefully chosen relationships did wonders. Eight years ago, I moved back to the state where I was raised, a just-in-case few hours\u2019 drive away. Available for an emergency; distant enough for my own sanity.\nIt\u2019s been a couple months since my father\u2019s fall, the injury that landed him in a hospital and then a nursing facility. Over this time, we\u2019ve had regular fights about his dog (which he cannot care for), the relative safety of various future housing options, money, and the myriad chores he wants me to do or orchestrate. Like many people caretaking for parents with memory issues, some days feel like Groundhog Day. Others are a personal hell of screaming demands that trip childhood memories over and over\u2026 with me being the only side that remembers either past or present form of the conversation.\nThey aren\u2019t fights, exactly. A fight happens inside my phone. It\u2019s one-sided, his anger enough for two. I respond with reminders, deep breaths, repeated explanations. I say, \u201cI love you, Dad,\u201d in case it\u2019s our last call. I hang up and try to get back to my work.\nI recently stumbled upon an older study that looked at the emotional strain on parental caregivers who had been abused as children. It should be little surprise that those who\u2019d been abused or neglected reported higher rates of depression while caregiving for those who hurt them. A New York Times blog sorted through the complex ethical implications of this conundrum. Parents are supposed to care as well as they can for their children; children ought to provide such care in return. Yet if the parent harmed the child, what is owed? If providing care brings back those old harms, is doing so a healthy choice?\nEvery day now, I spend time on the phone with a care-provider of some sort, trying to arrange a service or an appointment or untangle the various services my father keeps trying to set up by phone for \u201cwhen I go home,\u201d with no way to pay for it, confusion among the recipients of his calls, and no memory of how infeasible it all is. There\u2019s a block in his mind there. I doubt he has any idea how he treated me as a kid either. It\u2019s not worth telling him now, because it won\u2019t stick.\nI\u2019m a believer in moral duty, so I\u2019m doing the best I can to help provide what he needs. It would be understandable for someone in my position \u2014 someone maybe wiser about self-protection \u2014 to have long ago cut things off.\nMy phone rings again. He is consistently able to remember that I\u2019m someone always willing to help him. I try. Even in the best circumstances, our systems of care are difficult to navigate. Surely, at this point, I cannot change who he is, let alone who he was. All that will be left is a memory of who I tried to be as it all fell apart for him, the ways I tried to be of service. And the tiny ways \u2014 like letting this last call go to voicemail \u2014 that I made sure to take care of myself too.

The eyes were right, or were they? Were those fake teeth? Shapeshifter Leto did it again.\nPhoto: MGM\nWeCrashed costar Anne Hathaway told Stephen Colbert that Leto, a notorious Method actor, didn\u2019t break character once on set during six months of filming. One day on set though, when House of Gucci\u2019s trailer came out, Hathaway says she sprung a joke on Leto, quoting Lady Gaga\u2019s line \u201cFather, Son, and House of Gucci.\u201d She said it was as if Leto split in three: Leto, Paulo Gucci and Adam Neumann. \u201cIt was like a horcrux,\u201d she said.\nCount me concerned.\nIt\u2019s as if in rebellion for the mere pretty-boy he might have been elsewhere in the multiverse, our Leto defiantly became Actor Leto. Transubstantiator, transmuter Leto. Or a glob of some other Leto slipped through to Earth-199999 (or is it Earth-616?) and that bit of Leto substance retained the ability to pour into and fill various Leto-adjacent molds.\nLeto in Chapter 27, depicting John Lennon\u2019s killer\nI expend time worrying we\u2019ve lost the original, the Platonic form of Leto.\nThere\u2019s an aesthetic concept, the uncanny valley, that reckons there is a relationship between an object\u2019s resemblance to a human being and our emotional response to it. My daughter has a very realistic, super freaky baby doll that dwells in this unnerving proximity to the appearance of real baby dolldom. As some AI robots look increasingly like biological humans, people become unsettled to a degree that it becomes harder to have empathetic relationships with them. They are almost, but not quite right for natural affinity to bloom.\nTo my mind, it\u2019s not that Leto is less human, of course. But instead of tracking my response to human and near-human things, if I were to graph only the category of Jared Leto and Leto-proximate beings, you\u2019d see my distress. The actor has strayed enough times from the archetype of Leto in my head that to see all these near-varietals gives me the jitters, sets my teeth on edge.\nWe\u2019re to the point where Jared Leto circulates within the uncanny valley of himself.\nI suspect any reader who has come with me this far is just as upset about Jared Leto as I am, or is wondering why I don\u2019t just avoid watching him. Easier said than done when a shapeshifting Method actor can saddle into any show or film unsuspectingly and leave me squinting until realization sets in.\nAnd yet, I\u2019m excited to see Morbius \u2014 I\u2019m enough of a former 90s girl to have a soft spot for vampires. I\u2019m not sure I can see old Jordan Catalano as a biochemist, but the CGI effects that transform into a him into a throat-slasher will be a relief, evoking a face far enough away from Leto\u2019s to relieve the uncanniness of his other more recent metamorphoses.", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 51, "created_time": 1649879803707, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Marvel Cinematic Universe", "Jared Leto", "Hollywood", "Entertainment", "Culture"]}, {"author": "Sarah Stankorb", "post_id": "33722cd7e1b5", "user_id": "f1dabdbbfd1b", "title": "Americans Are Not Buying Religious Exemption Claims for COVID Vaccines", "content": "Americans Are Not Buying Religious Exemption Claims for COVID Vaccines\nA new study from Pew Research Center shows most U.S. adults doubt the sincerity of religious objections\nVaccine drive at Union Baptist Church, Baltimore, MD. Photo credit: Tom Nappi\nTwo-thirds of U.S. adults believe most people claiming religious objections to COVID-19 vaccines \u201care just using religion as an excuse to avoid the vaccine,\u201d according to a new study released by Pew Research Center. While many employers have adopted vaccine requirements, it\u2019s common to allow exceptions for those who claim the vaccine violates their religious convictions.\nThe public, broadly, seems to suspect this is being exploited as an easy rationale for opting out.\nHowever, the majority who think religious objectors are just making an excuse also think these people should be allowed to keep their jobs. Among those who think people claiming a religious reason to skip the vaccine are sincere, only three percent think those opting out should lose their jobs anyway.\nThere appears to be a lot of skepticism and forgiveness on this particular front, a rare gray area during a pandemic where public attitude appears to be comfortable with moral ambiguity.\nLast December, just as the Omicron variant was tightening its hold on the U.S., the Public Religion Research Institute and Interfaith Youth Corps announced a notable public sentiment: one in ten Americans believed getting a COVID-19 vaccine conflicted with their religion. (At that point, 28 percent of unvaccinated Americans surveyed claimed a religious prohibition.)\nThis was on the heels of increasing vaccine mandates by the Biden administration, including through OSHA (the Occupational Safety and Health Administration) and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services \u2014 which in turn would apply to millions of workers at healthcare facilities participating in those programs. Non-compliance could lead to termination. While the U.S. Supreme Court rejected much of the mandate, justices allowed the portion applying to healthcare workers at facilities receiving federal dollars to stand. Related cases pertaining to Naval personnel and federal workers, have been winding through appeals courts, with the former so far receiving a one-paragraph Supreme Court ruling that granted reinstatement of the Biden program as it applied to Navy SEALs.\nWith COVID rates having plummeted in the U.S. and mask mandates loosening, the question of religious exemption \u2014 or through many eyes, religious excuse-making \u2014 may seem a less urgent matter.\nStill, within some sectors, mandates and exemptions are still a hot topic. As Fierce Healthcare, a healthcare industry news source, reports: a growing list of hospitals have suspended workers, fired some, and have seen resignations from others. Some smaller hospitals cited concerns that enforcing mandates would exacerbate existing staffing shortages.\nDespite some outcry, however, most systems reported losing one percent or fewer of their employees over refusal to vaccinate.\nThe Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has been issuing periodic, if somewhat milquetoast guidance that notes employers must offer reasonable accommodations for employees who refuse to get vaccinated for medical reasons or sincerely-held religious beliefs. As the Society for Human Resource Management notes, the definition of \u201creligion\u201d is so broad that employers \u201cshould ordinarily assume that an employee\u2019s request for religious accommodation is based on a sincerely held religious belief.\u201d If an employer is \u201caware of facts that provide an objective basis for questioning either the religious nature or sincerity of a particular belief\u201d or practice, they can request additional supporting information.\nThat\u2019s not very firm ground and leaves a lot up to interpretation as to whether a religious belief is sincere \u2014 and what qualifies as religion.\nPerceived sincerity seems to be in the eye of the beholder.\nThe recent Pew study did show that respondents\u2019 own religious convictions greatly colored their willingness to believe another person was sincere in claiming a religious objection to COVID vaccines. Religiously unaffiliated people (atheists, agnostics, religious \u2018nones\u2019) were most likely not to buy religious excuses, a figure that matched the fraction of Democrats and Democratic-leaning respondents (77 percent) who likewise saw the claim as an excuse.\nWhite evangelicals were the most likely to believe religious objections are sincere, (and even then, the majority of white evangelicals still thought these claims were insincere).\nThe majority of Protestants, Catholics and the religiously unaffiliated all believe employers should let employees with religious objections keep their jobs even if they decline the vaccine. Here, identical proportions of white evangelicals and Republican and Republican-leaning respondents (82 percent) believed religious objectors should keep their jobs.\nOnly 29 percent agreed employers should mandate the COVID-19 vaccine, while 27 percent said employers should neither require nor encourage employees to get vaccinated. Those who believe in vaccine mandates are likely to be skeptical of religious objections, with only five percent thinking these objections are sincere. Among the group who objects to mandates or even at-work vaccine encouragement, 86 percent believe employees should keep their jobs even if not vaccinated. Nearly half also accepted religious excuses as sincere.\nThe vast majority (44 percent) however, thought employers should encourage the vaccine but not mandate it. This middle path group wasn\u2019t keen to see people losing their jobs even if only using religion as an excuse.\nOverall, at this point, there appears to be apathy for picking a fight about vaccines when religion can be invoked.", "comment_count": 9, "like_count": 289, "created_time": 1649096844646, "comment": [{"user_id": "f1dabdbbfd1b", "comment_time": 1649096844646, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "49ed43fda80f", "comment_time": 1649163229739, "comment": "Since these same religious people have been giving their children required vaccines before going to school pretty much forever, they\u2019d need to show me the passage in the Bible where Jesus specifically prohibits the use of the COVID vaccine."}, {"user_id": "f8cce68232c2", "comment_time": 1649158384917, "comment": "Don't worry.

So many of us need a season of renewal.\nPhoto by Yoksel \ud83c\udf3f Zok on Unsplash\nI walked out the door of my office midday yesterday to an aggressive, warm wind, a bright, open sky, and the twinge of lilacs in the air. I\u2019d planned to go buy a quick lunch \u2014 I\u2019d been trying to beat a work deadline and was about to reward myself. But the warmth, the smiling people seated at outdoor tables, the flutter of wind and sun, all drew me out of my plans.\nWithout much thought, I turned the other direction and began an unanticipated stroll.\nSpring. What a marvelous thing. I pushed up the sleeves of my sweater in the seventy-degree warmth, smiled as I passed strangers. The novelty of seeing people\u2019s full faces hasn\u2019t yet waned for me, and whether this is a return to some glimmer of regular life or a brief blip, like so many we\u2019ve experienced since 2020, I don\u2019t know. But for the first time in a long time, the pandemic wasn\u2019t among the first thoughts in my mind. The weight of anxieties, work, all the rest had moved along for a bit.\nNow, back at my desk, reality settles. All is not normal. War grips lives far from me, with evident war crimes committed against civilians. As ever, our world holds horrors. We\u2019ve spent years craving principled, clear behavior from our leaders \u2014 and been tossed about in chaos. Each day, looking at the news, the headlines blare that things could get much worse.\nAnd yet, outside on my walk, by myself, with sun shining through tree branches, my mind had strayed to a now unfamiliar calm.\nHumans crave reprieve.\nDaffodils were popping up, all proud green shoots and slips of yellow and white. For years, to me, they\u2019ve been the first sign that spring was actually on its way, maybe a few more frosts, but soon enough, spring.\nIn some ways, it feels as though we\u2019ve been navigating one long winter since March of 2020. Sure, we had warmer months that year \u2014 cut to me chasing my kid around the yard, trying to keep a wide bubble of distance between her and neighborhood children. The leaves turned. Our collective season of loss grew darker; the terror gripped deeper. Vaccines promised a bit more light \u2014 like at the end of winter when you start to notice the days hold a few more minutes\u2019 daylight. But really, months just kept dragging on, and whether people remained socially distanced as suggested, the distance between so many of us increased. Broad swaths of the country accepted The Big Lie. We were holed up in our corners \u2014 if not safely in our homes. A chill sat, still sits.\nAnd yet, as Covid rates for my entire state have now fallen to what was roughly the rate for my just town a few months ago, the skies are opening up. I\u2019ve started to feel a strange sort of hope. What will the official end of the pandemic feel like, I wonder. Like this?\nThe past few years have been such a protracted period of grief. Millions of people will forever carry scars from this time. Our kids\u2019 generation will have been shaped by this time, by lost parents and grandparents; masks; weirdness at school; months without in-person school; people whose health remains complicated by the virus. All that doesn\u2019t go away in a season.\nThe storms of this period forced our country, our world, to begin intellectually confronting inequity on so many levels. Will many people drop the needed struggle, weary, craving easier days as they arrive? I wonder for how many generations hardship has peeled open an obvious need for change but when more comfortable times arrived, tired people took the easier path when available.\nI do have a sense that many are spent, depleted. That spans local leaders to activists to parents to seniors to kids to family caregivers. When I try to fold my brain around the past few years, it\u2019s like we hit a societal rock bottom. I\u2019ve been thinking a lot lately about how, collectively, we\u2019ll spring back from this.\nOr maybe that spring, like a busted slinky, has been so far over-extended, we\u2019ll never be the same.\nA kick of renewal could help.\nMany cultures celebrate renewal or rebirth this time of year. The Hindu festival Holi just passed a few weeks ago, a time of love, color and new life. Christians have Easter, celebrating the resurrection and integrating signs of spring, like lilies. (And for the kids, an egg-laying springtime bunny harkening back to older celebrations of the Germanic goddess Eostre.)\nIn the sunshine yesterday, I felt exuberant. It\u2019s been a while since I felt that way.\nI don\u2019t know if one day we\u2019ll look back and count spring 2022 as the time our world began its rebound away from COVID. While many countries are functionally behaving as if the pandemic is all done, a global all-clear may be a long time coming.\nFor every spring, eventually, there is another winter. This last one was just so long, so dark. I\u2019m looking everywhere for signs of that season\u2019s close.\nYesterday did feel like a personal shift though. I caught myself counting time not in \u2018pandemic months\u2019 or \u2018pandemic years.\u2019 I met my work deadline and so I was less worried about work time too.\nInstead, I was snagged by sun and flowers and people walking their dogs. It was a needed respite, and I do hope, before whatever else might come next, we all get a bit more of that.", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 59, "created_time": 1648739383648, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Spring", "Essay", "Covid 19", "Mental Health", "Relaxation"]}, {"author": "Ed Zitron", "post_id": "e1d5a489f5b0", "user_id": "d7f06ddd6c07", "title": "Spotify Doesn\u2019t Care About Anyone But Themselves", "content": "Spotify Doesn\u2019t Care About Anyone But Themselves\nWelcome, readers, to my new Medium-based column around whatever it is that I find entertaining, enraging or empowering in any given week. This doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m done with my newsletter, or that I won\u2019t be writing anywhere else \u2014 this is just another place that I\u2019ll be doing so. I thought about calling the column \u201cEdStrong,\u201d but writing that out made me feel nauseous.\nSpotify, a company that makes billions of dollars by paying musicians 1 cent for every million plays of their song, has said that they \u201ccondemn\u201d podcaster Joe Rogan\u2019s use of slurs, but \u201cwill not silence\u201d him. Rogan, who got paid more than $100 million to move his podcast to the service, apologized in the same limp, empty way that every single racist guy you\u2019ve ever heard does when they\u2019re caught saying a slur \u2014 he\u2019ll \u201cdo better\u201d and \u201cisn\u2019t a racist.\u201d\nLet\u2019s see what Spotify plans to do as a result of this situation, other than the obvious thing that would fix it:\nIn his note to staff Sunday night, which Spotify provided to CNN Business, [Spotify CEO] Ek said that he would be committing \u201can incremental investment of $100 million for the licensing, development, and marketing of music (artists and songwriters) and audio content from historically marginalized groups.\u201d\nIt\u2019s unclear, however, whether such action will quell the controversy related to Rogan. Critics have called for far harsher measures, with many calling for the company to fire Rogan.\nThis tells us a few things:\nSpotify would really love you to stop asking about this.\nSpotify thinks that they will make more money keeping Joe Rogan than they will from losing him.\nSpotify does not care about this situation at all, and sees it as a marketing opportunity.\nSome people have said this is Spotify\u2019s Facebook moment \u2014 a flashpoint where meaningful change has to happen, a dark omen that the best days are behind the company, to which I say a hearty \u201clol\u201d and \u201cLMAO.\u201d\nI am 100% sure that Spotify knew all of this would happen, and had complete awareness of all the awful content that Rogan has put out. They quickly deleted over 100 episodes of Rogan\u2019s show, which means that they absolutely knew what slurs or racism he\u2019d said and was ready to remove them at any time. Rogan himself hasn\u2019t complained about them doing so, which means Rogan himself is completely aware of the situation. It may hurt to hear, but this is all part of the plan \u2014 a built-in defense strategy for an asset that Spotify knew said racist things and spread misinformation.\nNaturally, this has led to a debate about \u201cfree speech\u201d and \u201ccensorship,\u201d and how this is all so terribly unfair on the multi-millionaire that loves saying a particular slur and has given a platform to vaccine misinformation peddlers.\nJoe Rogan isn\u2019t being censored. If he\u2019s kicked off of Spotify, he\u2019s not being censored, because censorship would suggest Spotify isn\u2019t a for-profit business operating for its own benefit. Spotify paid him a great deal of money knowing that he was a \u201ccontroversial\u201d (IE: culture war stuff about how the government wants to steal your stuff, or racism/race science, etc.), and now that the things they knew were happening were made more public, they\u2019re now basically saying \u201cyeah, it sucks, we took some stuff down, who cares.\u201d\nIf they cut any of his content, this isn\u2019t \u201ccensorship,\u201d it\u2019s business. They are choosing what content they want to put into the world with \u201cSpotify\u201d on it, which may or may not include content where Joe Rogan says (or had said) slurs.\nNevertheless, what Spotify was buying with Rogan was attention. They wanted Rogan because they knew he would create this kind of controversy \u2014 they knew there would be stuff in there that people got mad at. Rogan has always been this type of person, pushing \u201ccounter-cultural\u201d stuff of the \u201cI\u2019m just asking the [vaguely racist or xenophobic] questions\u201d variety. Rogan has not changed, he has not morphed, he did not \u201cbecome a different guy\u201d when he joined Spotify \u2014 and Spotify knew that, and is currently enjoying both having their cake and eating it.\nDaniel Ek, Spotify\u2019s CEO, can now say that he\u2019s \u201cdone something\u201d and \u201cadmonishes racism\u201d without ever having to really do anything. Deleting 100 episodes of a podcast doesn\u2019t help anyone, and the vague idea of maybe spending $100 million on \u201caudio content from historically marginalized groups\u201d is one of those nebulous promises that very rarely gets followed through with. It also doesn\u2019t fix the problem at all \u2014 you are still housing a person that had these views, and there is no evidence that Rogan is different other than his \u201csorry you feel that way\u201d video.\nWhat\u2019s amazing is that Spotify really benefits from all of this. As the Times\u2019 Greg Bensinger said:\nThe streaming service Spotify would like us to believe it is grappling with profound matters of free speech and censorship as it faces mounting pressure over repeated Covid disinformation from its star podcaster, Joe Rogan.\nBut there\u2019s a far simpler explanation \u2014 it\u2019s about the money. And the listening public is the one paying the price.\nSpotify gets to say that they \u201cdon\u2019t take on the position of being content censor,\u201d all the while benefiting from the vast amounts of attention this situation has brought them. If Rogan leaves, say, to Rumble.com, Spotify gets out of their contract without having to actually cancel it. They are able to act like moral pioneers while doing absolutely nothing \u2014 while this is a negative situation of sorts, Spotify has managed to position themselves as \u201cin the right\u201d without taking any moral position of any kind.\nThey also knew it would turn into this vacuous \u201ccensorship\u201d debate, and that the kind of \u201cI\u2019m more of a right-leaning centrist\u201d right-wing types would jump to defend Rogan. By not really doing anything about the situation but saying \u201cwe are not racist,\u201d they successfully court Rogan\u2019s audience \u2014 people who are conscious that the things they are talking about and spreading are hateful and hurtful, but want to justify saying them because of \u201cfree speech.\u201d\nDespite many of these people making fun of \u201cliberals who need a safe space,\u201d Rogan has and is their safe space for someone to confirm their biases, someone with a big platform. Rogan is a \u201cfree thinker\u201d who \u201cisn\u2019t poisoned by the elites\u201d (despite regularly hosting them and being contracted by a multi-billion dollar multinational), and that is partially what Spotify was buying \u2014 the license to say that they \u201csupport a variety of voices,\u201d especially when one of their most well-paid voices is a white bald guy from New Jersey.\nIn the end, Spotify and Rogan are the ones that benefit from this. If Rogan leaves Spotify (or is forced to leave), he will get an identical deal from Rumble or another \u201canti-cancel culture\u201d platform. If he stays, he gets to do whatever he wants, and I think that Spotify knows that the vast majority of subscribers don\u2019t care about whether Rogan stays or goes. The other winners are the crackpots that Rogan hosts, who will now find themselves empowered by Spotify\u2019s meek response.\nThe losers are those who Rogan misinforms, and the groups that his words help marginalize. Nobody is being saved or informed by deleting old episodes \u2014 there are no consequences for Rogan or Spotify \u2014 and the message that Spotify\u2019s response sends is simple: we give a shit about people of color and telling the truth to an extent, but not enough that we\u2019d harm our bottom line.", "comment_count": 1, "like_count": 33, "created_time": 1644259711142, "comment": [{"user_id": "d7f06ddd6c07", "comment_time": 1644259711142, "comment": "Spotify Doesn\u2019t Care About Anyone But Themselves"}, {"user_id": "26c1a629ff88", "comment_time": 1644532721889, "comment": "1. for a millions streams Spotify pays approx. 3.200$!

He\u2019s a bit-part Spider-man character that was, confusingly, given an entire feature-length movie, played by Jared Leto. Even more confusingly, the film\u2019s tagline is \u201ca new marvel legend arrives.\u201d\nTo be clear, I have been reading comics since I was 9. I have a huge collection of original comic artwork, I\u2019ve met numerous famous comics people, and I have kept up with at least every major Marvel event since the early 2000s. Morbius is a character that I barely remember from the 90\u2019s Spider-man cartoon, and that\u2019s only because I recently watched it with my son.\nMorbius himself is, as you\u2019d guess, a living vampire. What this really means is that he\u2019s a vampire that can walk around during the daytime, probably because that\u2019s the single most annoying part of writing a vampire character.\nIn any case, Morbius, the movie based on a no-name character, was given a 75-million-ish budget and a star \u2014 Jared Leto \u2014 along with the single most confusing marketing campaign in the world. The trailer (and yes, I extend this to the other trailers) is one of the biggest marketing blunders I\u2019ve ever seen, because it tells you nothing about the movie other than that Jared Leto is a spooky dracula that can fly, and that at some point somebody, probably Michael Morbius, murders a bunch of people on a boat.\nDear reader, I am going to tell you something shocking: Morbius isn\u2019t a bad movie, and has several pretty great bits. I will endeavor not to spoil them, but this is also not a movie that you can really spoil.\nAnd, honestly, I want to talk about how Sony might have avoided a 74% drop in the box office a week after release.\nThe biggest problem with the way Morbius was marketed is that at no point does anyone seem to have watched the movie. Morbius\u2019 actual plot is based on the lives of two children \u2014 Michael Morbius (Jared Leto) and Milo/Lucien (Matt Smith) \u2014 who suffer from debilitating diseases that riddle them with pain and nausea, requiring them to have constant medical support. The intro shows that both kids were deeply broken by their upbringing, most of which took place in hospitals, where they\u2019re horribly bullied.\nYou may not think that this means much, but when you queue the movie up as a reaction to having a shitty childhood where you\u2019re in constant pain and suffering, it makes a lot more sense and is a great deal more interesting.\nAnyway, Morbius (who\u2019s naturally a Super Genius) ends up, in the most brute-force foreshadowing since Lucy, becoming a blood doctor that creates artificial blood (he turns down the nobel prize for inventing it, which is neither explained nor justified) that also has a bunch of bats in his lab. It\u2019s extremely stupid, and eventually leads to him doing Illegal Science to take his special mystery disease cure made of bat dna in a big boat in international waters just outside of New York. It definitely makes absolutely no sense, and it is utterly bizarre, but nevertheless he becomes the Living Vampire Morbius, curing his disease in exchange for consuming blood (it quickly becomes obvious that artificial blood has diminishing returns). On realizing how The Living Vampire Is A Crazy Monster, he refuses to administer the \u201ccure\u201d to Matt Smith\u2019s Milo, who is furious and, of course, ends up taking it anyway.\nI\u2019m not going to go through the plot line-by-line, but this movie is less about him being a spooky dracula and more about him realizing he has turned himself into an actual monster. Dr. Michael Morbius \u2014 an incredibly funny name to say out loud, for some reason \u2014 spends most of the movie deeply regretting the cure and realizing that he has gone too far, rather than flying around saying \u201cI\u2019m The Big Scary Dracula, Woouuuuu\u201d as the trailer would have you think.\nThe important thing that makes Morbius good \u2014 and I\u2019d say the back half of the movie is pretty good with a few great moments \u2014 is the interplay and chemistry between Matt Smith and Jared Leto that the marketing completely failed to show in any way, shape or form. I don\u2019t know how to put this \u2014 they\u2019re great! They bounce off of each other, it feels natural, and when they become enemies, Matt Smith is a genuinely amazing villain.\nIt is truly insane to me that they completely hid this relationship and, indeed, Matt Smith\u2019s vampire turn. I assume they think that this was a big surprise and secret that would\u2019ve ruined the movie, but I am confident that if people got even a glimpse of how incredibly good Matt Smith is at being a foppish superhuman dandy that eats people alive\u2026they would\u2019ve actually seen this movie, which they will now never do.\nThe bulk of Morbius isn\u2019t about spooky draculas, but about how one sees the universe as fair or unfair. Matt Smith\u2019s character has spent most of his life suffering and being below people, and once he becomes Another Living Vampire (it feels disingenous to call Morbius \u201cthe\u201d living vampire on seeing this movie), he reacts to the world has it has to him \u2014 with derision, violence and, well, sadism. And he\u2019s great! Every single time Matt Smith was on screen the movie improved. He is like Crispin Glover meets David Tennant, dancing around and laughing at the people he\u2019s hurting and the fun he\u2019s having doing so.\nAnd the dynamic between Morbius and Milo is great \u2014 their fight scenes are cool, they look like animals beating the crap out of each other, it feels desperate and weird and like a horror movie. While this isn\u2019t a great movie, it was immensely enjoyable \u2014 the scene that begins with Morbius confronting Milo as a vampire for the first time is legitimately great, interestingly shot and fun. It\u2019s a fun movie. This movie does not look remotely fun in the trailers.\nIt\u2019s interspersed with Tyrese Gibson and Al Madrigal\u2019s FBI (I think) agents on the trail of Morbius, who are surprisingly\u2026good? They\u2019re funny. They\u2019re fine. I got a chuckle or two.\nAnd that\u2019s the problem with this movie \u2014 so much of it is hidden in this ugly, stupid marketing, driven by dumb things like tweeting about \u201cthe Morbius Discord Community\u201d and focusing on the fact that yes, this April you can see Jared Leto as a spooky flying dracula. I would love to write \u201cthey tried to market this as,\u201d but I cannot tell you what it is they were marketing. A movie about flying vampires? A movie in which Jared Leto chooses to \u201ccure the world or destroy it,\u201d a line that is not in the movie? In fact, the trailer is full of stuff that didn\u2019t make the movie, which makes me think, somehow, that someone actually put a degree of thought into it.\nWhat they should\u2019ve done was market this as what it is \u2014 a schlocky horror-action movie where two childhood friends both turn themselves into monsters trying to cure their chronic diseases. Making a movie in which you see two similar people \u2014 bullied, sickly, suffering \u2014 take two wildly different routes on receiving supernatural power is interesting. Most people have been bullied! Many people have been very sick recently, and chronic pain affects about 20% of Americans. You could\u2019ve marketed it as \u201cwhat would you do if you got these powers?\u201d and shown Matt Smith eating some guy versus Michael Morbius trying to work out a cure. It\u2019s a good hook! It\u2019s better than what you\u2019ve got!\nWhatever it is you think reading this, I do not recommend you inconvenience yourself to watch this movie. It is good, not great, with some great moments. It has absolutely nothing to do with Marvel, and the closest you get to anything related (other than the post-credits scenes that make no sense) is a vague mention of a \u201csituation in San Francisco.\u201d\nWhat I do recommend is streaming it and enjoying as the dumb movie it is. Once you get past the exposition of the beginning, it\u2019s good. Every scene with Matt Smith is great, and if they are not completely insane they should have him in the real Marvel Cinematic Universe as a villain immediately.\nI\u2019ll watch it again the day it comes out on streaming to see if I somehow experienced some sort of brain accident during the movie, but I am confident that way more people will enjoy Morbius than you\u2019d think.", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 1, "created_time": 1649713774545, "comment": [], "post_tag": []}, {"author": "Ed Zitron", "post_id": "b9b8f264b70", "user_id": "d7f06ddd6c07", "title": "The Futility of Attendance", "content": "The Futility of Attendance\nAttendance at the office is one of the least-indicative proof points of someone\u2019s efficacy at a job\nPhoto by Gez Xavier Mansfield on Unsplash\nIn one of my early jobs, I had a particular manager that I quite literally never saw leave work. They were always there, always typing, always frowning, always dealing with something ranging from a slight annoyance to a full-blown crisis that they could never quite articulate. They were always making arbitrary demands, and I cannot remember in the time that I worked there any time when they were not some monstrous form of \u201cbusy.\u201d\nThe person in question was also the least-productive human being I\u2019ve ever had the misfortune of running into. Despite all of their demands of the lower-level staff, they continually failed to actually produce anything of their own beyond approving long, meandering and pointless documents. From my rough calculations, they \u201cworked\u201d over sixty hours a week, but I cannot to this day point to any specific thing they created.\nI\u2019ve met plenty of people like this person, and I\u2019ve realized that they exist not to do anything, but to prove to do-nothing executives that work resembles the work that they believe got them to where they are today. Many executives simply don\u2019t do any of the work that actually makes the company money, and they face a deep-seated anxiety as a result, which makes them desperately search for things that resemble what they believe \u201cgood work\u201d looks like.\nI wrote about this phenomena yesterday as it relates to \u201ccyberloafing,\u201d a term that means \u201cdoing stuff on the computer at work that isn\u2019t work,\u201d a thing that literally everybody does. I believe that the only people that think that \u201cgood work\u201d comes from being in the office for exactly 8 hours and only working are those that haven\u2019t done any actual work for years (or their entire career), and are thus can only relate to work in a kind of abstract pantomime. If someone isn\u2019t working exactly what they believe work should look like \u2014 even if their work is good and delivered on time \u2014 the ignorant manager or executive will regard them as \u201cbad\u201d because it reminds them that they, themselves, have no idea what\u2019s going on in the workplace.\nAppropriately, legendary executive moron David Solomon, CEO of Goldman Sachs, has created an internal tracking system to see who\u2019s in the office \u2014 one that says that you were absent if you\u2019re not in by 10 am. Solomon, a grown adult man that also DJs, has been a staunch anti-remote work ghoul since the pandemic began, claiming that you can\u2019t run a business remotely while also, confusingly, running Goldman Sachs remotely.\nIt\u2019s also important to know that the conditions at Goldman Sachs have been described as \u201cinhumane\u201d by junior bankers.\nIn any case, the idea of attendance-taking in a modern organization is one of the more bizarre and condescending ideas I\u2019ve seen in the last few years. Attendance at the office is one of the least-indicative proof points of someone\u2019s efficacy at a job \u2014 going to a place and being at a place is only proof that you\u2019re able to move your body, and I can\u2019t think of any good (let alone \u201ctop\u201d) performer I\u2019ve worked with that had flawless attendance.\nWhat Goldman is actually doing is proving that they lack the intellectual capacity to create a system that actually measures people\u2019s contribution to the organization. Despite revenues in the tens of billions, Goldman Sachs somehow lacks the resources to try and understand what people are doing versus where they\u2019re doing it, all because of distant and ignorant management.\nIt also says a great deal about how little Goldman values its talent. If you\u2019re taking attendance, it\u2019s because you don\u2019t trust people enough to do the thing you want them to do, or you\u2019re tacitly admitting that the thing you want them to do isn\u2019t valuable or enough for them to do it on their own. And it\u2019s going to drain talent from the organization as people realize that their bosses don\u2019t care about them, or their work, or their production, but their meaningless attendance in a big building in a city that costs a lot of money to live in.\nIt\u2019s all so depressing.", "comment_count": 6, "like_count": 257, "created_time": 1648751912284, "comment": [{"user_id": "d7f06ddd6c07", "comment_time": 1648751912284, "comment": "The Futility of Attendance"}, {"user_id": "ef36cfe6889a", "comment_time": 1649164910420, "comment": "I saw a quote somewhere once that was along the lines of: \"Bad managers don't know how to manage people, so they manage clocks.\""}, {"user_id": "e9b7fe368034", "comment_time": 1648799764721, "comment": "I started a new job in February this year, split 50/50 remote and in office, and each day we have to send a check in e-mail to HR to let them know where we're working from, and if we are indeed working."}, {"user_id": "864c49413791", "comment_time": 1649286407113, "comment": "This is brilliant"}, {"user_id": "d3e800f40d", "comment_time": 1649136735464, "comment": "Awsome Content Thanks"}, {"user_id": "6bce68a4d80d", "comment_time": 1649775338939, "comment": "I know of one, Wally Fagen.

Almost everything was about the slap \u2014 at first jokes, then takes, then articles attempting to explore the depths of what happened, and what it means for society.\nThe slap is the perfect catalyst to make social media go completely insane, not simply because of the popularity of the Oscars, but because it involved a surprising, norm-defying event. The Oscars are well-known as being a flaccid, drab celebration of (in many cases) the celebration of a very specific kind of movie, one that critics call \u201cimportant\u201d or \u201ca breath of fresh air\u201d or something or rather.\nThese events have always had a degree of simulated chaos \u2014 mostly in the form of people reading out the wrong winner (there was also one streaker and Samuel L Jackson got caught complaining about losing) \u2014 but there was always a set tone and implicit agreement that things happened in a certain way in a certain order. The decorum of The Oscars \u2014 an increasingly meaningless circus of not-quite-qualitative evaluations \u2014 was always counted on the professional actors in the audience to not get up and cause problems.\nExcept Will Smith did, and he did so in a way that was equal parts chaotic and organized. He cracked Chris Rock in the face, sat back down and then yelled that he should \u201ckeep [Jada Pinkett Smith\u2019s] name out of his fucking mouth\u201d \u2014 twice! \u2014 and then went on to win an Oscar not long after. It is utterly incredible that this event happened, but also extremely obvious \u2014 this could have happened any time to anyone on that stage.\nThis could not have happened at a better time for internet chaos, as we enter the 54th cycle of cancel culture panic as people are \u201cafraid of not being able to speak their mind,\u201d by which I mean \u201cpeople are afraid of not being able to speak their mind because of the consequences of doing so.\u201d Twitter has also become a kind of moralism flywheel, where people are convinced that every follower is waiting for their judgment on a particular event, leading to plenty of people claiming that \u2018violence is never the answer\u2019 and demanding Will Smith have his Oscar stripped because he slapped Chris Rock.\nFurthermore, the Russian invasion of Ukraine has led many people to get angry that even an ounce of attention is diverted toward a man hitting another man when a war is going on. This was the Super Bowl for those looking to be morally superior in their tastes and discussion topics, and guess what? If you\u2019re talking about that slap, you hate Ukrainian people and don\u2019t care about the war.\nThe best part is how meaningless all of it is. There are countless new takes about how this slap was indicative of a degeneration of society, or Hollywood, or the Oscars are taking this event \u2014 because of an intellectually masturbatory hunger to interpret events first and in the most meaningful way so that you can be known as \u201cthe smart person.\u201d\nExcept what actually happened was a celebrity was rude about another celebrity and he got smacked in the face for being rude. He did something that was out of the ordinary on a big award show, and there was news about it.\nThese situations are an amazing crystallization of the point-scoring nature of modern intellectualism \u2014 that it is never enough to make a few jokes or funny comments and move on, and that we must prove that we aren\u2019t just right about something, but that we know more about it because we\u2019re smarter and better people that have the right morals.\nAnd this one is unique because it\u2019s so big, and yet so incredibly low-risk. Wherever you land on this may be a kind of moral litmus test, but it ultimately doesn\u2019t matter at all \u2014 Will Smith, Jada Pinkett Smith, and Chris Rock will all be fine, and no doubt have some sort of reconciliation that also doesn\u2019t matter at all. But the omnipresence of a particular event online makes it feel like the most important thing in the world, especially on Twitter, where we don\u2019t just get well-thought-out bad takes, but ones that were considered, at best, for half a second.\nAnd this time next week, it\u2019ll be gone.

And not just the random buckets of used-only-once cleaning products. I was also reevaluating the need for the things I genuinely loved, like the artworks I had bought on holidays and the books that would immediately start gathering dust again once placed back onto their relocated shelf. It all seemed like too much. Too much stuff to pack. To carry. To unpack. To maintain.\nMy partner and I talked about making a sea change for years. We wanted to leave life in Sydney behind for a simpler, lighter existence a little further up the coast. Now it was finally time to leap. Yet, here I was: Sitting on the floor of the half-empty apartment, feeling like the things we owned, owned us.\nThe dark side of decluttering sprees\nMarie Kondo and Co make us believe that shedding our stuff is an act of personal liberation. And if my life were a Hollywood comedy, our moving day would have been the perfect moment for a whimsical montage. Items would be dumped in the bin, sold to strangers on Gumtree (the Australian version of Craigslist), and overflowing bags handed to happy and grateful looking volunteers at the charity store. A fun, carefree and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 instant transformation to minimalism that ends with us driving off into the sunset in a mostly empty moving truck.\nYet, this was real life, meaning that it didn\u2019t just lack the soundtrack and time-lapse; the process was also a lot more complicated.\nAs someone trying to tread lightly on this planet, a decluttering spree epitomises much of what\u2019s wrong with our modern relationship with stuff. It has little to do with the intentional decisions at the heart of minimalism.\nWe offload our possessions without much care, with many items going into landfills or overwhelming charity stores, making our act of liberation a burden on others and the planet. Additionally, there is usually little focus on addressing the underlying issues and buying behaviours that led us to accumulate so much in the first place.\nSo, instead of giving in on my impulse to create a grammable minimalist home overnight, I decided to master the art of ambling into minimalism using these three principles.\nUse what you already own\nMinimalism is as much about making the most of what you already have as it is about reducing your possessions. Interestingly, focusing on using what I owned didn\u2019t turn out to be a limitation but a source of creativity and inspiration.\nIn the case of clothing, this meant raiding my wardrobe first before even thinking of buying anything new. Did I already have something similar in my closet? What items could I combine in new and exciting ways?\nSome pieces weren\u2019t quite my style anymore, so I took them to a local alteration studio to get sleeves removed or a hem taken up. I also rediscovered a few pieces of clothing I loved but rarely wore because I somehow thought they were \u2018too much\u2019 for day-to-day use. There is no better time than a global pandemic to remind oneself that life is too short to wait for special occasions to bust out your Sunday best!\nAnd there are plenty of other ways to be resourceful with the things you already own, ranging from the mundane to the precious and unique. Bought some conditioner that makes your hair feel greasy? It will make an excellent substitute for shaving cream.\nI even had my partner\u2019s old skateboard deck turned into a custom artwork for his birthday. It\u2019s now a conversation starter at every event at our house rather than gathering dust somewhere in storage.\nIt only takes some imagination and time to breathe new life into old things.\nOffload your stuff responsibly\nEven the most restrained consumers among us will accumulate things we don't need. Outdated, electronic equipment, clothes that no longer fit or gifts we never liked in the first place \u2014 the list goes on.\nThe trickiest part of moving toward minimalism can be to get rid of these things responsibly, especially if you don\u2019t give yourself enough time.\nIn my experience, selling unwanted items is the best option because if somebody is willing to pay money for something, they will also likely use it. Facebook Marketplace, eBay and Craigslist are all great options for second-hand selling, but it can sometimes take a few weeks to find a new home for your stuff.\nSelling my pre-loved items also helped me become a more mindful consumer. There\u2019s nothing quite like only getting a third of what you paid for something you rarely used to make you think twice about your next purchase.\nDonating to charity can also be a responsible way to minimise your belongings while helping those in need. However, anything you donate must be useful, clean and in good working condition. The not-for-profit sector does not have the resources to deal with non-functional items, and they will eventually end up in landfills anyway.\nIf I can neither sell nor donate items because they are beyond repair, I look for ways to recycle them, which can take a bit of research. Some fashion brands like Zara and H&M offer to recycle old clothes, no matter where you bought them. Nike takes any old sneakers, and many local councils will help you dispose of your electronic and chemical waste responsibly.\nPutting something into general waste is the very last resort for me.\nRefrain from re-accumulating\nOnce you have pared back your stuff, the biggest challenge is to develop strategies that will prevent you from re-accumulating new things.\nAfter reading a few articles on minimalism online, you will get targeted with a wide variety of sleek, sustainable and minimal looking products to match your new lifestyle. Yet, no matter how cool these things may make you or your home appear, giving in to the temptation to buy is just a different form of consumerism. And there\u2019s a risk that you will fall back into your old patterns \u2014 just with different kinds of stuff.\nOne strategy that has worked well for me is to consider how often I would use something before making a purchase. If it is rarely used, I will look for options to borrow or rent instead of buying. For example, I may ask a friend if I can wear one of their dresses for a special occasion or ask the neighbour if they mind lending me their ladder for a weekend. It\u2019s not just a great way to save money and prevent new clutter but also to forge new connections in your community.\nFor items that I will use more frequently, I have started making lists to prevent me from giving in to my impulses. Whenever I feel like I need to buy something, I will put it on the list first. If it\u2019s already on there, it\u2019s a good indication that I will use it frequently and may warrant a purchase. If the item is not on the list, I will add it and wait to see if I think about it again. More often than not, the urge to buy will pass as quickly as it comes.\nFinally, rethink how you, your friends and your family approach gifting. While it can be lovely to receive birthday gifts or surprises, many presents we receive are neither practical nor loved. Could there be different ways to show your appreciation and affection?\nIn our busy schedules, time can be one of the most precious gifts. So, I decided to find creative ways to spend more time with loved ones on their special days. For instance, I will always organise a hike followed by a lovely dinner to celebrate one friend\u2019s birthday. The memories of these days will last a lifetime \u2014 and will never feel like a burden when it\u2019s time for her to load the moving truck.", "comment_count": 8, "like_count": 905, "created_time": 1622631400848, "comment": [{"user_id": "2ec0b3d471f", "comment_time": 1622631400848, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "3c34792304b8", "comment_time": 1649406025723, "comment": "Hi Andrea, I am on a very similar journey and taking it slowly is the best way to make sure that new homes are found for as many items as possible.

Blocking climate action.\nWhile many people are well aware that the employment claims of the extractive industries are exaggerated, the ongoing media stories and ads about job losses due to the transition to a net-zero economy are fueling the fears of people living in regional mining communities.\nIt\u2019s no coincidence that during COP26, the United Australia Party (UAP), founded by none other than mining billionaire, Clive Palmer, ran advertising on YouTube and in regional newspapers with the Tagline: Zero emissions, zero jobs, zero future.\nYou can watch the short ad here on YouTube.\nMainstream media often ridicule Palmer and his party cronies, but it would be wrong to underestimate their influence or how much money they are willing to spend to advance their interests.\nIt\u2019s difficult to get full transparency on advertising spending of political parties across all channels. However, the UAP is by far the most significant political advertiser on Google in Australia. According to Google\u2019s Transparency Report, they have spent $6.7 million on ads on Google, YouTube, and have been in Google\u2019s advertising partner network since November 15, 2020. The next highest spender is the Australian Labor Party Secretariat which spent a mere $92,100 over the same period. A worrying gap, especially in an election year.\nLosing an unlosable election: Job creation myths sway public opinion\nWithin Australia\u2019s representative democracy system, it\u2019s unlikely that the UAP will ever appoint a Prime Minister from within their ranks. Yet, their efforts can still significantly influence national narratives, public opinion, and election results.\nIt\u2019s a fact that became painfully apparent in Australia\u2019s 2019 elections.\nIn the lead-up to the ballot, opinion polls had predicted that the Australian Labor Party \u2014 which had been campaigning with strong climate action messaging \u2014 could not lose.\nHowever, they ended up losing to Australia\u2019s other major party, the pro-mining Liberal-National Alliance (a.k.a The Coalition). Their leader, Scott Morrison, had famously brought a lump of coal into parliament to demonstrate that \u201cthe stuff Australian men and women dug out of the ground\u201d was nothing to be afraid of but was fueling the country\u2019s prosperity.\nOne of the main contributors to the election outcome were voters in Queensland moving to parties on the populist right, not least because of the controversial Adani coal mine and the employment opportunities it would allegedly bring to regional communities. Even though the parties on the populist right didn\u2019t get enough votes to gain a seat in the lower house, many of the preferences for these parties were directed to the Coalition.\nThe mining = job creation campaigns of the far-right helped the more moderate Coalition to maintain the status quo when it comes to resource extraction and export.\nRegional mining communities need a vision for a just transition\nThe issue with the job creation narrative the resource lobby continues to promote in regional communities is that there\u2019s no convincing counter-narrative addressing the needs and concerns of the locals with the same determination or budget.\nSure, there are other parties campaigning in these regions, but their messaging about a net-zero economy is lacking two key elements: A vision for the regions after the mines have closed and practical ideas for a just transition for people currently employed in the sector.\nBecause even though it\u2019s true that a net-zero economy will create more jobs than the extractive resources sector in the long term, 80% of current fossil fuel jobs are in fossil fuel extraction, and these jobs will decline fast with decarbonisation. Getting people who are employed by or running small businesses dependent on the sector voting for change will require a plan and a story that actually includes them.\nAs it stands, there\u2019s no incentive for the political right and the resource sector to change their story in regional communities. In fact, we\u2019re starting to see a shift away from coal mining to promoting gas as the job creation engine of the future \u2014 a tactic that has the potential to catastrophically delay the shift to renewables.\nThe question that does arise then is this: Who is in a position to paint a vision for a just transition for regional mining communities? The Greens and other political parties with progressive climate action policies, as well as local government are obviously central to shaping both the policies and the narrative. Yet, it\u2019s also evident that they won\u2019t be able to compete with the deep pockets of the mining sector on their own.\nThe net-zero transition needs allies to help level the narrative playing field. Brand activism has the potential to fill this void.\nBrand activism and narrative power\nIn recent years, we have seen more and more brands speak up about topics that would have previously been considered off-limits for private sector organisations. The Black Lives Matter movement, #MeToo, and the US elections are just a few examples of businesses becoming more politically outspoken as a result of buyers increasingly refusing to buy from brands that act counter to their values.\nTo shift the employment narrative in regional communities though, brands would have to go beyond aligning their activism with the demands of their buyers though. They would have to use their storytelling powers to establish a new audience and create demand in the first place. It\u2019s a space that\u2019s difficult for brands to navigate and more likely to be led by the business-to-business (B2B) than the business-to-consumer (B2C) sector.\nEmerging and established renewable energy companies like Capricorn Power, Bombora Wave Energy and Greatcell Energy are clear contenders to lead the charge in just transition brand activism by investing both into initiatives and campaigns. The step is congruent with both their interests and their values. These companies could be more vocal in explaining what types of jobs their industries are creating, what skills from the extractive sector are transferrable to renewables, how they are helping candidates to retrain and tell a more compelling story about life in regional communities in a net-zero economy.\nWhile the renewables sector may not have the same funds available to create campaigns on the same scale as the mining lobby, there are some signs that the purchasing power dynamics may well be changing.\nThis week, Atlassian co-founder Mike Cannon-Brookes and his partners Brookfield Asset Management have sadly failed in a bold attempt to accelerate Australia\u2019s exit from fossil fuels through a take-over bid of the country\u2019s largest climate polluter, AGL Energy. With federal elections scheduled for the first half of 2022 and powerful players continuing to shape the narratives in our regional communities, some of the budget allocated for the transaction may be well invested in supporting a more daring vision for a just transition.", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 100, "created_time": 1646624753148, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Climate Action", "Politics", "Brand Activism", "Australia", "Fossil Fuels"]}, {"author": "Andrea Hoymann", "post_id": "7dbbdbec4770", "user_id": "2ec0b3d471f", "title": "How to make the switch to ethical banking in Australia", "content": "How to make the switch to ethical banking in Australia\n\nThis article is based on my personal research and experience in making the switch to more ethical banking in Australia. It is intended for educational purposes only and does not constitute financial advice. You should always seek financial advice that is tailored to your personal situation and needs.\nChoosing where to open my first bank account in Australia was not a deliberate decision. I\u2019d arrived in the country in 2007 as an international student and needed an account to manage my money. Dealing with the challenges of identity verification without a history of residential records or a Medicare card was difficult enough. And learning more about the different available bank brands wasn\u2019t a priority for me at the time. What\u2019s more, all banks seemed to offer more or less exactly the same thing anyway.\nSo, I did what most people do in this scenario. I just walked into the nearest branch and opened my first Australian bank account with NAB. Over the years, I added a joined account with my partner, a savings account and a credit card. Staying with them was easy and convenient and I didn\u2019t put much further thought into it.\nAs it turns out, I\u2019m not alone with my banking set and forget mentality. 40% of Australians are still with their childhood bank and 1 in 5 people have said that they could not be bothered changing. In fact, more people file for divorce than switch their banks.\nWhy ethical banking matters\nThe thing is, where we choose to bank matters. Financial institutions invest our hard-earned savings \u2014 amongst other things \u2014 into loans to help small businesses and large corporations grow and expand. And if you care about environmental or ethical issues, these investments are unlikely to all be aligned with our personal values. For example, a recent report revealed that Barclays has financed $56 billion in new fossil fuel projects since January 2021.\nIn Australia, a similar picture emerges. According to the Australian Conservation Foundation and Market Forces, all four major Australian banks continue to back fossil fuel projects until at least 2030. So, if you\u2019re banking with them, you\u2019re inadvertently supporting sectors you may otherwise be trying to avoid.\nThe good news is that there are many ethical banking options available in Australia. Based on insights by Market Forces, there are at least 60 banks in Australia with no record of fossil fuel funding since 2016 who have also explicitly made divestment a part of their mission statement.\nBig bank brands and the perception of security\nAs someone who graduated university right in the middle of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) though one question did make me a bit nervous about switching to a smaller and perhaps less well-known ethical banking brand: is my money going to be safe?\nEven though I knew at least since the collapse of Lehman Brothers that there is no such thing as too big to fail, there was something about the might of the brands that projected a sense of security.\nHowever, a little bit of research quickly revealed that Australian banking industry regulation protects my money via the Financial Claims Scheme. FCS provides protection to deposit-holders with Australian incorporated banks, building societies and credit unions for deposits of up to $250,000.\nChoosing an ethical banking option\nWith the security question out of the way, it was time to decide where I wanted to switch to. In the end, I decided to go with Bank Australia mainly because they have made their ethical values such a central part of their messaging.\nBank Australia does not invest in fossil fuels, live export, the arms industry, gambling or tobacco \u2014 all sectors I was honestly a bit surprised I had to make an explicit choice that I did not want to see my money invested in.\nOther factors that got me over the line were that Bank Australia is a certified BCorp that started life in 1957 as the CSIRO Co-operative Credit Society. It joined with 71 other credit unions and co-operatives to become Australia\u2019s first customer-owned bank in 2011. The company does not pay executive bonuses and is not listed on the stock exchange. Instead, every customer has one equal share, has voting rights at their Annual General Meetings and gets a say in where money is invested through their Impact Fund. Profits are returned to customers in the form of competitive rates, fair fees and quality products and services.\nIt\u2019s a model I have not seen elsewhere and found so interesting that I even read their annual report. Definitely a first for me.\nSwitching over your accounts is easier than you think\nThe one thing I was probably dreading the most in this whole project was all the admin of changing my payment details absolutely everywhere.\nLuckily, it turned out to be much easier and more seamless than I had anticipated. I also made sure to give myself enough time for the process to iron out any potential issues. Here are the steps I took to make the switch to more environmentally-friendly banking:\nStep 1: Open new accounts with the bank of your choice\nOpening a bank account is pretty straightforward these days and can be done online or over the phone. If you\u2019re opening a joined account you will have to make sure the other person is available to speak to the bank to provide their consent. In the case of Bank Australia, my partner also had to set his own account up online first to be able to open a joined account. The process for this may change a little from bank to bank.\nI also opened a separate savings account that offered slightly better interests than a normal everyday account (even though interests are on the low end everywhere at the moment).\nStep 2: Change your details for incoming funds and transfer funds from your old accounts\nNext, I changed my banking details for any incoming funds such as salaries. I also transferred all existing funds and savings from my old to my new accounts. This meant that I had enough cash in there to also start changing over the details for my outgoing payments.\nStep 3: Change your details for outgoing payments\nThe easiest way to know exactly where you need to update your details is by reviewing your bank statements from the last 12 months and making a list of payees. This usually includes:\nRent/mortgage\nLoan repayments\nUtilities\nPhone\nHealth & other insurances (e.g. roadside assistance)\nOnline payment apps such as. PayPal, Google Pay, Apple Pay\nCharities and club memberships\nNewspapers and Magazines\nNetflix, Spotify and other content subscriptions\nI did also give myself some overlap time between accounts to make sure nothing important was missed. But to be honest, once you have ticked off all the most important outgoings, the worst thing that can happen is that payment with your old details gets declined and you get a notification to update your details.\nStep 4: Close your old bank accounts\nThe last step is to contact your old bank to request the closure of your old accounts. This will likely need to happen over the phone. At least, in my case, there was no option to close accounts online. However, the process was relatively painless and nobody at my old bank tried to talk me out of it.\nOnce that is done, you can give yourself a pat on the back for making the switch to ethical banking.\nOriginally published at https://greenden.net on November 13, 2021.", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 0, "created_time": 1636954390861, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Ethical Banking", "Environment", "Australia", "Personal Finance", "World"]}, {"author": "Andrea Hoymann", "post_id": "ebd037c6f95e", "user_id": "2ec0b3d471f", "title": "Maggot robots take on the massive global food waste challenge", "content": "Maggot robots take on the massive global food waste challenge\nAustralian startup develops a modular solution to remove food waste from landfill.\nImage by Julia Kuzenkov on Unsplash\nStartup journeys are rarely linear. It often takes many iterations to get something from a mere idea to a market-ready product. And sometimes, a business idea can change entirely during the discovery process. For Olympia Yarger, it led from wanting to launch a sustainable poultry farming business to developing modular maggot robots for food waste management through her Canberra-based startup Goterra.\n\u201cWhen I started, I was just looking for a sustainable protein feed for a poultry enterprise. And that\u2019s how I found insects. Initially, I switched my focus to farming those instead of poultry to avoid the trap of doing too many things at once,\u201d says Olympia. \u201cBut then I realised that the supply chains around feeding animals (or humans for that matter) are broken in their current state.\u201d\nAustralia\u2019s agricultural sector depends on carrying heavy road and rail freight over vast distances to feed farm animals. This adds to the sector\u2019s overall environmental footprint and is also a major money drain. Feed makes up 70% of production costs for farmers and the cost of feed is relative to its transportation requirements. And Olympia didn\u2019t want to replicate the model for her insect farming business by carrying food waste across the country to feed insects that would then, in turn, feed other farming animals in the supply chain.\nTaking the leap: from insect farming to food waste management robots\n\u201cIf we had used the same intensive farming model to farm insects as in the intensive farming of any protein, we would have also replicated the same problems. That\u2019s why we switched gears to fix the logistical challenges around feeding protein and combine it with proximity to the waste streams for the insects,\u201d says Olympia. \u201cAnd once we figured that out, it was like \u2018hold on a second: this is a food waste management business, not a protein business\u2019.\u201d\nGoterra now deploys maggot-filled modular robots within the existing waste management system to process food and effluent waste, which would ordinarily end up in landfill. Food waste in landfill currently costs the Australian economy alone around $20 billion per year. It also accounts for an estimated 6\u20138 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions.\n\u201cIf we had used the same intensive farming model to farm insects as in the intensive farming of any protein, we would have also replicated the same problems.\u201d\nInstead of disrupting the existing waste management process though, Goterra is looking to integrate its solution within the system. This means taking advantage of the waste management processes that are working efficiently. Large waste producers such as hotels, hospitals and schools can host the units on site. For smaller volume clients, the process is comparable to regular landfill collection. Waste distributors pick up the food waste and then bring it directly to Goterra or modular units at landfill sites.\n\u201cI think what\u2019s interesting is that there\u2019s a real market pull for our solution,\u201d says Olympia. \u201cWe work a lot with SUEZ who are looking for ways to take food waste from landfill. But the existing options are limited and often very specific in terms of the volume they are willing and able to take. Or the facilities are too far away to be viable.\u201d\nGoterra\u2019s agile, modular solution overcomes that challenge at half the cost of food waste going into landfill. What\u2019s more, after 12 days of maggot robot processing, the team ends up with two other sellable products:\nthe manure of the insects (frass) that is going into composters or becomes a natural fertiliser;\nand the insects themselves that are in high demand as a protein stock feed.\nHiring the right team to walk bravely into the unknown\nIn 2020, Olympia raised AU$8 million in a Series A funding round co-led by Australian agrifood tech VC firm, Tenacious Ventures, and Grok Ventures to help scale Goterra\u2019s operations.\nUntil then, though, Olympia had to manage the balancing act of insect farming, innovating and fundraising with a lean team. \u201cOnce the funding came through, I was able to hire. But before that, it was just two interns and me,\u201d says the entrepreneur, who at the time spent 10 hours per day on farming-related activity alone. \u201cMaintaining resilience for extended periods is hard in this situation. You constantly need to reaffirm that you\u2019re OK. That you\u2019re going to make it, even if you just stuffed something up. And that is difficult.\u201d\nYet, while the funding enabled Olympia to grow the team, she was cautious not to rush the process. Before bringing on an executive team or other staff, she wanted to know exactly what kind of people she needed to hire to stay on the right path. And that required both an understanding of the skills and personality traits she sought.\n\u201cI suddenly had to move operations from a two hundred and eighty square metres facility to twelve thousand square metres. And most of the information needed to do that was in my head. So, having the right people on board was fundamental to me,\u201d says Olympia. \u201c I needed to be able to walk up to them and say: \u2018We\u2019ve got four hundred and eighty Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). None are going to apply to the new facility. Could you write a plan for how we will evacuate the new space?\u2019 And even though they may not have done that before, they\u2019d just go and figure it out.\u201d\nTo help to get the right people on board, Olympia\u2019s first hire after the fundraising was a Head of People. For the first month, she did nothing but define and write down Goterra\u2019s company culture. \u201cIt felt a bit weird to receive all this money and not to launch straight into action, but it was the right step,\u201d says Olympia. \u201cThe people were always going to be what made or broke us. Nothing was more obvious to me than the effort required by my staff to move through the unknown happily and well while also having some level of fulfilment.\u201d\n\u201cI suddenly had to move operations from a two hundred and eighty square metres facility to twelve thousand square metres. And most of the information needed to do that was in my head.\u201d\nThe requirement to walk bravely into the unknown exists in any start-up. But even more so in a business creating an entirely new category: such as maggot-fueled food waste management robots.\nIt also requires a team with a unique skill set.\n\u201cFor a long time, we thought we would likely need these different kinds of engineers. But the longer we worked on the business, we realised that we need tradespeople,\u201d says Olympia. \u201cAnd then you say to the new CTO: \u2018here is an electrician and a fitter\u2019. And they have never worked with people in these types of roles before. But again: If you\u2019ve hired the right people who are curious, who are learners, that kind of request is exciting and interesting, not scary and overwhelming.\u201d\nWhat to do when the pattern is off: fundraising for a hardware start-up\nWith a solution and business model in high demand, Olympia did not have any issues finding investors willing to back Goterra. However, raising the money was still a learning process.\n\u201cWhat makes a hardware start-up difficult compared to a SaaS platform, is that investors are looking for a success pattern. The first question when you turn up with a maggot robot for food waste management is: \u2018How many users is that?\u2019 And that\u2019s the first time your answer doesn\u2019t fit the pattern. Then the next question is: \u201chow much capital do you need?\u2019 And the answer is lots. And then the pattern is off. You just don\u2019t fit in any of the stories.\u201d\nThat\u2019s why Olympia worked on talking about her business in a way that would resonate with investors. This meant disregarding most commonly accepted startup advice.\n\u201cThe majority of startup media give you these mostly made up templates where you provide investors with ten Kawasaki slides. Then you follow up three days later with this particular email template to get the meeting,\u201d says Olympia. \u201cBut I haven\u2019t had that kind of experience even once. Sometimes you don\u2019t pitch a deck at all. Sometimes you just talk in the middle of a conference with an investor who is interested enough to have a chat. And then they send you one hundred and fifty-two questions, and you send them the answers. And four months later, they\u2019ll send you another hundred and fifty-two questions.\u201d\nOlympia\u2019s problem with the templated route is that founders can get lost in the process. They focus their attention on fitting the template rather than getting good at talking about their business. \u201cThat\u2019s how you end up spending too much time trying to shove your unit economics into the same template as AirBnB. And it won\u2019t ever work. You are never going to be able to tell that story because you\u2019re not AirBnB.\u201d\nInstead, Olympia used the fundraising process for Goterra to get good at explaining the ins and outs of the business. This meant asking for a lot of feedback from investors \u2014 especially the ones that didn\u2019t end up backing the company. Was there something she could do better? Was there something in her pitch that she didn\u2019t explain well enough?\n\u201cThere were even a couple of people who said something really kind of rude like: \u2018oh, this doesn\u2019t even make sense\u2019,\u201d she remembers. \u201cAnd I would stop my pitch and ask which part? Because if I can\u2019t explain my own business to you then that\u2019s a big problem and I don\u2019t want to even go any further.\u201d\nAnd she recommends that other founders seek this external perspective more frequently.\n\u201cI think what is more comforting [than any template], is to know your business well enough to stand in front of people who don\u2019t get it and share this journey. And if you can do that, then you can do anything. You then just need to find the right people to stand in front of.\u201d\nOriginally published at https://greenden.net on May 31, 2021.", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 21, "created_time": 1622443971873, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Sustainability", "Environment", "Startup", "Farming", "Waste"]}, {"author": "Marianne Bellotti", "post_id": "d2d1bc6cb4a", "user_id": "d196ba9afc2d", "title": "Fix A.I. in the Private Sector by Fixing It in the Military First", "content": "Fix A.I. in the Private Sector by Fixing It in the Military First\nSilicon Valley\u2019s ethics via opt-out isn\u2019t going to work anymore\nImage created by freepik\nLast week I wrote a piece for the popular military theory blog, War on the Rocks, about what Silicon Valley has learned about the impact of automation on complex systems and how that should shape the military\u2019s goals.\nDiscussing the military use case for technology with other technologists is often awkward. Many believe that it is possible to instill new technologies like A.I. with ethical and safety principles purely from the comfortable environments of ivory academic towers or plush FAANG collaborative spaces. One need not go where the technology might have its deadliest and most critical impacts. No need to risk your reputation with the association.\nI\u2019ve come to believe that this attitude is naive. Unsafe or unethical technology is a curiosity in academia. It\u2019s bad, but also good because there will be research dollars and accolades in documenting the edges of it. Unsafe or unethical technology is a PR problem for FAANG. It\u2019s bad, but also good because it typically means more profits. By contrast, unsafe or unethical technology in the military is a core mission failure. It means more dead soldiers in the short term and social unrest that creates more dead soldiers in the long term.\nWhen I started working in the federal space someone told me, \u201cNo organization on Earth is more incentivized to prevent war than the DoD. We should help them do that.\u201d And in my own experience, I\u2019ve found that to be true. People often confuse the rhetoric of politicians and defense contractors with the attitudes of servicemen and women. There is no organization more anti-war than the DoD because war doesn\u2019t just mean dead bodies to them. It means dead friends, separated families, disrupted \u2014 perhaps permanently \u2014 lives and futures. The costs of war are not hypothetical in the military, so the aversion to warfare is more intense than anywhere else.\nThe best place to answer the question of \u201cHow do we build A.I. in a way that prevents unethical and unsafe outcomes?\u201d is in the environment that has the most to lose from unethical and unsafe A.I. That will never be Google or Facebook, or Twitter. Recent events have demonstrated this. The best place to work on ethical A.I. and safe software is with the people for whom the stakes are greater than missed revenue targets.\nWe should help them.\nWhat\u2019s wrong with A.I.\nI wanted to write the War on the Rocks piece because I was sick of listening to people talk about \u201chow much money would be saved\u201d or \u201chow much more accurate the system would be\u201d once A.I. replaced humans in the military. Both of these assumptions have a bad track record and little evidence to support them. Automation (of which A.I. is merely a sexy buzzword) does not make systems cheaper, safer, or more accurate. What it does is push the boundaries of what a system can support in terms of response time and complexity.\nThose of us who have played nursemaid to a critical computer system know from experience the benefits of a faster system or a system that does more by touching more workflows are often limited. You might end up with fewer mistakes overall, but you will most definitely end up with more destructive, more unpredictable, and less preventable impacts from the mistakes that do happen.\nOur first brush with the complications of using machines to eliminate human error came from automating the work that system administrators do setting up, upgrading, and configuring servers. Software engineers built automated systems that could read plain text files with configuration instructions and reconfigure servers as needed on the fly. Doing so greatly decreased the number of errors triggered by mistyped commands or by forgetting to upgrade one or two servers on a list. Companies that implemented this automated approach decreased mistakes and increased efficiency. Eliminating human error also allowed systems to grow, becoming faster and more complex. But this growth came at a price. In automated systems, the errors that do happen can cascade through multiple subsystems almost instantaneously, often taking down broad swaths of seemingly unrelated operations. In November 2020, such a bug disabled a large chunk of the internet for several hours. System failures caused by unexpected behavior from error-reducing technology trigger catastrophic outages a few times a year at the top technology firms in the world.\n\u201cHelping Humans and Computers Fight Together: Military Lessons from Civilian AI\u201d\u2014 War on the Rocks\nAnd the military is already starting to notice the fine print hidden in their billion-dollar A.I. initiatives. Last week The Economist published an article outlining the perfect example of why automation does not make things cheaper:\nThe problem is that the savings tend to be wiped out because the drones rack up so many flying hours. Each of America\u2019s Global Hawks, a surveillance drone that can conduct day-long sorties, flies an average of almost 1,400 hours annually \u2014 the equivalent of two months in the air. The U2 spy plane, a cold-war stalwart still in regular use, does less than half of that. During 2016\u201317, the last period for which complete figures are available, America\u2019s ISR drones flew six times as many hours as every crewed ISR plane combined. Commanders\u2019 \u201cinsatiable demand\u201d for eyes in the sky has \u201cprevented overall reductions in personnel and operating costs\u201d, concludes CSIS. \u2014 The Economist\nWhy taking pilots out of planes has been more expensive than anticipated\nW HEN TOM CRUISE first appeared as Lieutenant Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell, the rakish naval aviator of \"Top Gun\", in 1986\u2026www.economist.com\nWhat\u2019s remarkable to me about a piece like this is that we already knew that automation does not decrease the number of jobs. It sometimes changes the types of jobs available, which can have devastating economic impacts, but automation does not decrease the number of people you need to employ in the short term.\nAnd while War on the Rocks wanted to frame my article as the military learning lessons from the private sector, the truth is if we software engineers were really all that smart we would have learned these lessons from the organizational scientists of the1970s and 1980s who first observed them. My favorite thing to cite lately is a paper from 1983 called \u201cThe Ironies of Automation.\u201d With a quick find/replace operation you could publish this paper today as a revolutionary, groundbreaking study on Site Reliability Engineering. The CliffNotes version? Automating a system to remove human error tends to make the system weaker overall.\nThe private sector is struggling with the challenge of ethical A.I. because the underlying assumptions that determine how this technology is going to solve problems are wrong.\nAutomation does not reduce the number of people you need to employ to accomplish a goal.\nHaving more data does not lead to better decisions.\nThe impact of mistakes is more important than the number of mistakes. Optimizing for fewer mistakes often leads to more devastating failures.\nThe engineering challenge that is really compelling to me is: What would A.I. look like if it was grounded in assumptions about decision-making and system design that were actually true?\nWhy the fix will come from the DoD: Purchasing power\nYou may be thinking: \u201cOkay, sure. But I don\u2019t see why we can\u2019t still fix these problems in the private sector and have that impact trickle down to the military.\u201d\nWhat few people realize about technology, is how much of it is directed by the purchasing power of the Department of Defense. \u201cRight,\u201d software engineers say. \u201cI know about ARPANET, but that was ages ago. We have venture capital now, things don\u2019t work that way anymore.\u201d\nExcept that\u2019s not true. That canister you talk to when you want to turn things on and off in your house? The technology didn\u2019t exist until the DoD invested $150 million to build a \u201cvirtual office assistant\u201d for military personnel. Originally called CALO which is Latin for \u201csoldier\u2019s servant\u201d it was later rebranded as Siri and sold to Apple.\nThe DoD\u2019s Grand Challenges turned Pittsburgh from a steel town to a center for self-driving vehicle development that Google, Uber, and all the major players in this space are leveraging.\nThink the advancements in virtual reality we\u2019ve seen lately comes from Kickstarter projects? The DoD has been dumping billions of dollars into that area since the mid-2000s.\nNot to mention all the major shifts in fundamentals where the DoD put its finger on the scales. From \u201cReadable\u201d programming languages to networking protocols\u2026 The internet was built on packet switching networks because the DoD decided that was the better option. TCP/IP beat the technically superior OSI because the DoD was so heavily subsidizing its development that it was effectively free for the private sector to use.\nAlthough Cerf and Kahn did not design TCP/IP for business use, decades of government subsidies for their research eventually created a distinct commercial advantage: Internet protocols could be implemented for free. (To use OSI standards, companies that made and sold networking equipment had to purchase paper copies from the standards group ISO, one copy at a time.) Marc Levilion, an engineer for IBM France, told me in a 2012 interview about the computer industry\u2019s shift away from OSI and toward TCP/IP: \u201cOn one side you have something that\u2019s free, available, you just have to load it. And on the other side, you have something which is much more architectured, much more complete, much more elaborate, but it is expensive. If you are a director of computation in a company, what do you choose?\u201d\n\u201cOSI: The Internet That Wasn\u2019t\u201d \u2014 IEEE Spectrum\nWhat the DoD decides is important is what the private sector ends up building, not the other way around. One of the few exceptions to this rule is Zero Trust\u2026 but only barely. I say barely because Google developed the Zero Trust methodology in response to the military and intelligence agencies of foreign governments attacking them. So the DoD didn\u2019t kick off the development of Zero Trust, but only because Google spotted the national security issue and invested in it first.\nWhen you have a budget in the billions of dollars, you get to pick the winners and losers. What the DoD decides to buy shifts the whole private sector in that direction. Or rather, the companies that shift in that direction get millions of dollars from the DoD and the ones that don\u2019t gradually go out of business.\nThe DoD is going to buy A.I. People who care deeply about A.I. being safe and ethical can\u2019t afford to sit this one out.\nIt can only be done here\nI\u2019ve been interested in reimagining software engineering by incorporating safety science into our process for a while. Only recently have I come to realize that discussions about \u201cethical\u201d and \u201csafe\u201d technology in academia and the private sector are largely irrelevant. When the DoD decides what \u201csafety-critical\u201d and \u201cethical A.I.\u201d is in this space, the weight of their purchasing power will wipe out all other voices.\nSo it\u2019s worth investing the time and energy helping to make sure they make the best decision possible. Both because they want to build technology that will lead to less armed conflict and fewer wars and because whatever becomes the standard at the DoD will become the standard we all have to live with outside of the DoD.", "comment_count": 2, "like_count": 130, "created_time": 1615990791271, "comment": [{"user_id": "d196ba9afc2d", "comment_time": 1615990791271, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "3a9ce2143be0", "comment_time": 1620909895684, "comment": "Ironies of Automation - very good!

So much so that there\u2019s never any shortage of smart people eager to jump in with their opinions. In my various engineering leadership roles throughout my career so far I have received many unsolicited architecture diagrams from ambitious, well meaning, software engineers absolutely convinced that they have found a brilliant solution to a really hard problem I owned.\nMy first question is always the same: \u201c\u2026are you going to be on call for this?\u201d\nNothing is more effective at defusing and dispersing rubberneckers and backseat drivers than that question. I mean \u2026 the people who say yes get brought into the inner circle \u2014 obviously \u2014 but those people are few and far between.\nAt the end of the day the people who need to make the decisions around what the technology looks like are the people who are going to be woken up at 3am when it goes wrong. Accountability is important at work, but it\u2019s essential in engineering.\nA lot of engineers get pulled into the trap of thinking there\u2019s one right way to build a thing and allow themselves to be drawn into arguments over technical correctness. Those fights are likely to be difficult enough to handle between colleagues within the on call team, you don\u2019t need more opinions from people who want the glory of a win but won\u2019t put any skin in the game.\nThe most important feature of an architecture is that the team running it feel comfortable with running it. Solving every other problem comes second.\n\u201cBuild it the stupid way first\u201d\nMost attempts to make systems \u201cscalable\u201d and \u201cresilient\u201d from the beginning fall back on assumptions of what operating conditions will be that aren\u2019t realistic. You end up making the system complex in places where complexity doesn\u2019t serve any of your interests. All because you\u2019re afraid of design flaws making you look dumb.\nIt\u2019s much wiser in my experience to start with a simple and naive design, figure out how it will go wrong in theory, monitor or verify that before fixing. That way instead of having to resolve unnecessary complexity when the system scales differently than you assumed it would, you get to pocket the benefits of simplicity.\nThose stories you keep hearing about the 10x engineer who built a system that scaled perfectly for ten years? Let\u2019s just say it out loud: they\u2019re urban legends. No one does that and it\u2019s not a realistic standard to hold yourself to. You know no one does it because the 10x engineer in question is always a colleague of a colleague. Or someone who used to work at your company but left just before you got there. Or some traveling gray beard who only does consulting work that an early stage VC brought in as an advisor ages ago but has since Bagger Vanced out of the company. It\u2019s never people you know and the systems in these stories never involve the system being unchanged for ten years. In all the versions of this urban legend I\u2019ve heard, the system is never just left in a basement to run for 10 years without any updates. And yet, the magical scaling factor is never attributed to the years of diligent maintenance and operations work. The fact that whole teams of people have been iterating the system this whole time doesn\u2019t count. If it scales it\u2019s obviously because a wizard/architect foresaw all the problems it would ever have and fixed them before launch.\nKeep things simple and solve only the problems you know you have.\n\u201cOptimization is death\u201d\nSimilar to the last koan although almost always about automation. Look, it\u2019s a great idea to automate things, but for every task you automate you make the system a little less resilient. That\u2019s because automation and other forms of optimization rely on steps or interactions being generalizable. Every time you optimize something to make it faster, more memory efficient or involve fewer humans, you\u2019re crossing your fingers and hoping the generalization holds. The more you do this in a system, the more likely edge cases are to create surprises.\nEventually there are so many edge cases that your system just stops working, either because you\u2019ve optimized to such a specific and narrow happy path that the number of customers for whom the technology doesn\u2019t really fit is greater than the number of customers for whom it does, or because it literally stops working and becomes so brittle, accidents are a normal experience.\nPeople tend to just assume that any and all optimizations are good, but no change to system boundaries or capacity is free. Write some SLOs and figure out whether further generalizations make sense given your system goals.\n\u201cGraph databases are lies\u201d\nI keep waiting for this one to go out of fashion and it never does. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love a good graph. But most of the time when someone brings up graph databases it is either preceded or followed by some kind of assertion that there\u2019s no possible way to store the data in a table, only a (dramatic music) graph database will do.\nExcept the data storage layer in a graph database is just a table \u2026 typically Postgres although a few use Cassandra. So obviously if we can use a graph database we actually can just store the data in a table.\nThe issue is not if graph databases are good or bad, it\u2019s more that engineers tend to idealize technology they don\u2019t understand and criticize technology they do. People who insist graph databases are more performant than relational databases don\u2019t know enough about graph databases to run them in production unsupervised. Graph databases have their uses and can be really valuable in some cases, but you should only choose a graph database if you can explain what those uses are (and what they aren\u2019t).\nIn general be skeptical of anyone who can\u2019t explain a full set of pros and cons along with their recommendation.\n\u201cDon\u2019t let dependencies own the logic\u201d\nThis is a new one for me. Like most of the engineers reading this column I have generally worked on projects where I own and am responsible for the environment. Until recently that is. My deploy story today involves deploying to some environments I control, some I don\u2019t and some that are \u2026 uh \u2026 complicated, either very old, very slow, resource limited or all of the above.\nThis has taught me one very important lesson: know what the value of the technology you\u2019re building is and know where the logic that creates that value lives.\nAnd then make damn sure you own that logic.\nTo put it a different way: If the core functionality of your software is dependent on an AWS hosted service \u2026 then you can\u2019t easily move your software off AWS. Managed services and SaaS is great, but the first draft of your architecture should focus on making sure those kind of dependencies don\u2019t lock you in. Once you know where the logic that defines your value is, then you can go to town with the managed services.\nOwning the logic doesn\u2019t necessarily mean writing the code yourself. You can use open source, no need to build your own database solution here. But pay attention to your licenses! So many software engineers (myself included) don\u2019t even look at licenses. If it\u2019s on Github we assume it\u2019s free to use however we want and that\u2019s not true.\nArchitecture Is Easier When It\u2019s Harder\nBuilding software is hard and software people put themselves under a lot of pressure to do it right. Unfortunately most of our instincts on how to do that point us in the wrong direction. You shouldn\u2019t jump in with brilliant ideas if you\u2019re not going to own them. You should keep things simple for as long as possible until you know what your usage goals are. You shouldn\u2019t assume technology you don\u2019t understand has some magic or secret sauce under the hood. You shouldn\u2019t default to products and tools owned by other people until you know what value your software brings to the table.", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 27, "created_time": 1649425138925, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Software Development", "Architecture", "Technology", "Software Engineering"]}, {"author": "Marianne Bellotti", "post_id": "c0536fbe30e0", "user_id": "d196ba9afc2d", "title": "Can You Use Formal Verification on a TableTop Game? (The Challenge)", "content": "Can You Use Formal Verification on a TableTop Game? (The Challenge)\nThe amazing things you learn by applying a tool to inappropriate challenges.\nhess background vector created by macrovector\nI am designing a tabletop game.\nThe idea came to me while cleaning out a box full of old conference swag I have collected from years of tech conferences. At one of the last four Shmoocons \u2014 or perhaps it was at B-sides? \u2014 I had picked up a copy of Backdoors & Breaches, a tabletop card game about security compliance.\nI\u2019ve never actually played B&B because I\u2019m not a security professional and I\u2019ve always found the cards to be so overloaded with jargon it\u2019s difficult for me to grok the strategy around the game play. But I like the idea of games as teaching tools. Particularly for challenges where participants dismiss the need for strategy. When the card pack emerged from its nest of corporate branded drink koozies, lanyards and laser jet printed brochures disguised as white papers my first thought was, \u201csomething like this should exist for legacy modernization.\u201d\nI immediately started trying to figure out how the mechanics of such a thing would work. I had the perfect use case for it. I was in the process of planning a two-three week train trip to smaller American cities with great tech communities (Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Detroit-Chicago was my plan). My book Kill It With Fire was about to come out and I wanted to get out there and help drive pre-sales. Since I often travel alone, I always look for opportunities to hang out with locals. Setting up talks with local meetups and hacker spaces seemed like a fun way to experience the real city, but setting up local game nights seemed even better.\nEspecially because game nights were the preferred networking events of the communities where I did my most impactful modernization work. Known as the Digital Coalition, several times a month you could find software engineers from 18F and USDS rubbing elbows with policy wonks from the Hill and the West Wing over board games.\nOf course this cross country trip was set for the summer of 2020 \u2026 so you already know how the story ended. Covid-19 shutdown cities, threw entire supply chains into disarray, and pushed game nights into the realm of closed circles and pandemic \u201cbubbles.\u201d\nDeveloping a programming language was crowned my top side project and the tabletop game on legacy modernization was filed away for a later time.\nThen two years later, I got my first Christmas card of the season in the mail. It was from an old New York friend who bought a vacation home in Denver just before the pandemic started and then subsequently moved to Denver as tiny New York apartments became a mental health liability. \u201cCome visit,\u201d it read. \u201cWe have a guest room.\u201d\nDC to Pittsburgh to Cleveland to Detroit to Chicago\u2026.. to Denver?\nGame on.\nSpecify All The Things\nWhen I picked up this project the first time around I kept getting distracted by wanting to figure out how to formally verify the game mechanics. Once you get into the habit of thinking about systems in terms of model checkable specs, you can\u2019t help but think \u201chow should I express this in boolean logic?\u201d all the time.\nAnd board games do have conditions we want to verify. For example, you don\u2019t want to design a game that can fall into a loop where winning becomes impossible. You also don\u2019t want to design a game where the game play is too short.\nBut how to express things like that as a spec? That was the part I found the most difficult \u2026 but it is also a regular struggle I had writing specs for software, which is actually what most spec languages are designed to do.\nThe Challenge\nFor the past couple of months I\u2019ve been experimenting with different approaches to this challenge and the draft column about it has gotten longer and longer and longer \ud83d\ude05 But before I publish that column I thought it would be more fun to challenge my community to outline their own approaches. If you can write a spec, that\u2019s great, but I\u2019d be happy just seeing how people break the game mechanics up into provable bits.\nIf you\u2019d like to participate you can reply with thoughts to this thread on Twitter OR respond via your own blog with a spec. The challenge will run until May 10th at which point I\u2019ll post my own iterations and thoughts on this problem.\nInterested? Good! So how do you play a legacy modernization game\u2026\nThe Game Mechanics\nThe basic mechanics of the game involve two decks of cards. The first deck has a set of cards with number values ranging from 50 to 100 (originally this was 50 to 250 but through a mix of simulation and specification it seemed obvious 250 was too high). These cards define the \u201cSuccess Criteria\u201d or the number of points that must be earned in order to win the game. Each one has a funny little description that when read together are designed to encourage players to invent a backstory of the system being modernized.\nFor the time being, the cards assign scores in one of four categories: Cost, Security, Performance, and Accessibility.\nThe second deck of cards the contain potential fixes and improvements across those four categories, each worth -10 to 50 points. There are two on each card so that the card itself is divided in half with one solution the mirror image of the other. Players are dealt a hand of 5 cards and go around in a circle playing their cards on the table to earn points towards their total. The player who reaches the same number of points in each category of the success criteria first wins.\nThe catch is that each solution on the card has a likelihood of success between 2 and 6 in addition to a point value. When playing the card, a player must roll that value or higher. Say that number is a 3, roll a 3 or higher and you get the points you need applied to the category you want. Roll a 2 and the card is played upside down, meaning the second solution is played instead. You could end up with points towards a different category where you don\u2019t need them, fewer points towards the category than what you wanted or you could end up with negative points.\nCards can be played locally or globally. Meaning that players can choose to play cards in front of themselves to improve their score or they can choose to play cards on the modernization project itself where they improve everyone\u2019s score. But, as you might be able to guess, you can also play cards against other player\u2019s totals, potentially sabotaging them.\nQuestions to Consider\nIf this challenge feels too overwhelming to even consider, let me help you out with some things I realized while drafting my specs.\nPlayable cards need to be in even numbers in the total deck because they are broken into pairs. A standard deck of cards has 52 cards, broken into 4 suits of 13 cards each. That was a useful reference point.\nIf a total value of playable cards for a suit is less than the highest possible goal score, then the game has unwinnable states. But this can\u2019t be solved just by making sure each suit set sums to > 100 because players will naturally be incentivized to play most of their cards locally and therefore the more players the game has the more diluted the pool of total points, the more unwinnable states. I do like the idea that the game is unwinnable if no one works together because that is definitely true for legacy modernization but it\u2019s better if the game dynamics lead people to that conclusion rather than frustrating them over and over again with unwinnable games.\nOne potential solution to the dilution problem is to cap the number of players. If so what is the maximum number of players before the game has too many unwinnable states?\nAnother potential solution is to introduce wild cards to the deck that allow players to remove or change the value of already played cards (without rolling any dice). Too few wild cards and the game has too many unwinnable states, too many and the game is too easy.\nEarly on a friend who frequently organizes game nights gave me the feedback that he thought four categories was too hard. Game structure could be tweaked so that two scores from the success criteria deck are drawn at random and only points towards a subset of categories actually count towards a win (perhaps adding some fun Fluxx type dynamics where the goals suddenly change in the middle of the game)\nSome Possible Approaches\nThe first really good lesson you\u2019ll learn from this exercise is something verification pros know well: you cannot specify the entire game in a single spec. Instead you need to choose a subset of interactions and focus on proving their properties. Typically this involves generalizing. Simulations are really useful but they are not specs. Here are some possible approaches to consider:\nThe behavior of one suit should logically be the same for all of them. So a 52 card problem need only be a 13 card problem.\nThe dice roll can be either ignored or for certain problems factored out by thinking of them as a set of possibilities. For each one card we want to put in the deck, we think of it as six potential states. If a card needs a roll of six or higher we add just one on state to the spec. If a card needs a three or higher then we add four on states to the spec.\nYou can think of various problems as a matter of points moving back and forth in various zones of the board (deck, local, global) or you can think of them as a graph of various winnable and unwinnable states and verify that the shape of a graph never has more than X unwinnable states.\nLooking forward to seeing what people come up with!

There are of course a few things I am afraid to write about, not because there might be a backlash \u2026 actually the opposite. The posts about management and organizational theory always do much much better than my technical content. The audience for them is larger. At the same time the internet is flooded with would be experts on engineering management and armchair startup advice. Some of that stuff ages really badly. I\u2019d prefer to keep this space technical, with the occasional management column when it feels appropriate.\nThen in late February I went to London to get a tattoo done by an artist I had been admiring over Instagram for a while. And at the end he asked me \u201cwhy did you pay me so much?\u201d which was a question that caught me by surprise. I had tagged an extra 25% onto his price quote as a gratuity because he\u2019d invested so much extra time and made the experience special for me. That was generous, but not absurdly or unusually so I thought. There will be no BuzzFeed articles about the tip I left here. This wasn\u2019t $1,000 on a $30 bill or anything. And\u2026 sure, it\u2019s not common to tip tattoo artists in the UK so he was surprised and pleased by the tip, he wasn\u2019t confused about what it was until he realized how much money I\u2019d left him.\nMore to the point, the last tattoo artist I had worked with put in 1/8 the time, thought and effort and charged twice as much! It seemed ridiculous that one artist with real talent, already getting attention from industry magazines and Instagram rebloggers, priced their services at one level, while a less experienced artist in a different city at the beginning of their career priced their services completely differently. I wanted to respond to his question \u201cwhy are you charging so little?\u201d but I didn\u2019t because I already knew the answer.\nNo one just understands how to navigate the difference between price and value. You learn how that game works because someone else admires your work, taps you on the shoulder and explains to you that you need to be charging more. People did this for me when I started doing technical consulting, and last year I got a more advanced lesson once I started doing professional public speaking.\nI know these things because someone actually explained them to me and helped me find the opportunities to apply that knowledge. Many people who work in areas where value is difficult to define get stuck at a certain hourly rate because no one ever tells them how to graduate to a higher level. It isn\u2019t what you think. It isn\u2019t about talent and it isn\u2019t about \u201cworking your way up.\u201d\nSo I thought\u2026 why have I never written about this before?\nFinding Your Starting Point\nIf you work in an industry where the range between the low end options and high end options is really wide, it can be difficult to know where to even start. For example, I can find freelance software engineers that will work for $40 an hour or I can find software engineers who work for $200 an hour. The difference between them is not always fully explained by the quality of their work. It\u2019s more about the context of their network. The words \u201c$40 an hour software engineer\u201d probably bring an immediate picture to mind. You know who that is. Same with the $200 an hour engineer. You know who that is too.\nAnd you probably know lots of people somewhere in the middle, but can\u2019t figure out where.\nHere\u2019s how you figure it out: first you define your absolute floor. What\u2019s the minimum you would accept for an hour\u2019s worth of work before you thought to yourself this isn\u2019t worth it!\nNow add $50 to that amount.\nEvery time someone asks you for a price quote on work, add $50 more dollars to your hourly rate. Keep doing this until someone says no. The price you were charging before you got to the no is your going rate.\nOf course you could have gotten unlucky and hit upon a cheap person right away. You might want to try the quote that triggered the no two or three times before setting your rate. $50 is also an arbitrary number chosen for the sake of the example, the real increment will vary based on the range of values between low wage workers in your field and high wage ones. I\u2019m currently going through this process now for public speaking and the increment I use isn\u2019t $50 it\u2019s $1,000. Low wage public speakers charge a few hundred per event, high wage public speakers charge tens of thousands of dollars. A wider range means you need to use a higher increment.\nBut those logistics aside the point is the same: you\u2019ll read a lot of thought pieces attempting to calculate your rate from cost of materials, hours of labor, years of experience, etc, etc, etc\u2026 At the end of the day prices are determined by what people will pay and the only way you know what people will pay is by asking them to pay you and seeing whether or not they say yes.\nMore Experience Probably Won\u2019t Boost Your Rate\nWhat you learn from this exercise is not the value of your work, its the earning power of your network. Most independent workers \u2014 whether they\u2019re artists, consultants or technical experts \u2014 get work from word-of-mouth. There might be some business from ads, content marketing, etc \u2026 but those efforts don\u2019t usually meaningfully extend your influence beyond a few degrees of separation.\nThis creates situations where two exceptionally talented artists with nearly identical skills can find themselves hitting completely different ceilings because the mediums they\u2019ve chosen don\u2019t have enough market segmentation. You can\u2019t charge more than your potential customers can afford to pay. If you work in a medium where all your potential customers are low wage workers or other artists, that will cap your earnings at a lower wage than someone whose potential customers are heads of state and venture capitalists.\nPeople tend to assume that more experience (read: an increase in skills) will get them access to those networks with higher earning potential and therefore higher wages. But that\u2019s not how high wage earners hunt for talent. In every profession there\u2019s a point where further improvements in skills are so subtle that the difference between one level and another can only be appreciated by another expert. Customers tends not to be experts. So after a certain level of skill has been achieved, any improvements that are made through experience are invisible to the people you\u2019re selling to.\nWe want quality to speak for itself, but it almost never does. Instead people tend to judge value by reference point. Rich clients attract more rich clients. A piece of art owned by a famous person is more valuable than it was before it was bought. A freelancer worker whose done work for someone important is more attractive to a higher class of client.\nThat means people do not work their way up to higher wages when they\u2019re independent agents. There\u2019s no amount of work done at a middle price point that leads to an offer to charge more. You get to the higher wage group by changing the network you\u2019re sourcing clients from.\nCalculating your starting point will tell you where you currently are. Looking at your network compared to peers who earn more will tell you how to charge more.\nCharging as a Filter Function\nWhat you charge is less important than how you charge, and by that I don\u2019t mean whether you take credit cards or Bitcoin. Rather I mean: what are you optimizing for when you calculate your price quote?\nLet\u2019s go back to my artist friend from the beginning of the post. When I initially reached out he asked me to describe the project I had in mind and then gave me a price quote. This is a sensible way to charge if your intention is to optimize for the highest number of billable hours. You may assume that optimizing for the highest number of billable hours is a great way to ensure you make as much money as possible but that\u2019s not necessarily true. You only have so many work hours in a day, so eventually you reach a point where the number of requests for your work exceed the number of hours you can work. Which jobs get filtered out?\nWhen you quote people rates in this fashion you filter a bit on price in that if someone can\u2019t offer your hourly rate they don\u2019t get a slot, but mostly you filter on the timing of the request. The first n number of people who request your work and can afford it get a slot. When the slots fill up everyone else is filtered out. This can result in scenarios where you cap your earnings at your price floor. Think about it this way: say you have slots for five customers and we have a queue of ten people. The first five people are willing to pay $100 for your work, the last five are willing to pay $500 for your work. How are you supposed to know that there are five people willing to pay $500 waiting to book appointments? When you are quoting people prices you end up losing $2,000 because the first come, first serve model fills up your day with the $100 customers.\nPeople don\u2019t work their way up to charging more because you don\u2019t get the time back once you\u2019ve committed to doing work at a lower price point. Any customers you take on at the $100 price point will naturally expect any follow up work to be billed at the same rate. The only way to transition to a higher rate when you quote prices in this fashion is to accept the attrition.\nThe photographer who did my headshots to promote my book charged me $700 and got me scheduled within a few weeks of my initial query. He works a couple days a week and takes long ski vacations that I jealously scroll through on Instagram. Recently I tried to book another photographer for a different project who charges $500 a session. She\u2019s booked six months in advance, works all the time and hasn\u2019t taken a vacation in years. Even if she knew I was willing to pay $700 what exactly could she do? She\u2019s already committed to six months worth of jobs. Unfortunately for her, I\u2019m not going to book a session six months from now, I\u2019m just going to find another photographer. Optimizing for billable hours will only reliably get you working more billable hours.\nHowever, artists generally don\u2019t want to optimize for billable hours. Artists tend to want to optimize for the quality of the project. And in that case you need to charge in a way that filters requests based on the quality of the project. The first step is to ask about the project, but \u2014 and this part is critical \u2014 before you quote a price you sneak one more question in:\nWhat\u2019s your budget?\nYou do not tell the client what you charge, you ask them what they can afford to pay and then you construct your offer based on that information. This allows you to be strategic in a way you couldn\u2019t be before you asked that question. Before you knew which customers had cool sounding projects and which customers had lame sounding projects but you had no ability to filter on this information because you didn\u2019t know what any of these people were willing to pay. You quoted a price and if the person with the cool sounding project couldn\u2019t pay that much you lost the cool sounding project. If the lame sounding project was willing to pay much more you lost both the income and potentially a slot for a cool project. When you know their budget you\u2019re empowered to have more control over what you\u2019re investing your time in. More to the point, you can raise your general rates without fear of missing out on work that\u2019s really valuable to you for artistic reasons. The person who told me to start charging more for public speaking put it like this: \u201cI charge these types of events $10K so that I can choose to speak for free at those types of events.\u201d\nIf a cool project comes along that is below your going rate, you may choose to give them a discount \u2026 but here\u2019s the thing: you never ever ever tell people that. What you charge is what you charge. The only time you tell people you are giving them a discount is when the reason you\u2019re giving them a discount is because you screwed up. I mean\u2026. Personally I don\u2019t give discounts for that reason anyway, but I understand why people do and in that case the whole point is that they know they are receiving a discount as an apology.\nBut you definitely do not tell people that you\u2019re giving them a discount because you think their project is cool. The reason why is because \u2014 again \u2014 your rates are determined by your network. If you tell a customer that you\u2019re giving them a discount every single referral that comes from that customer will expect to receive the same discount. They will assume that their project is just as cool and will not be pleased to be informed otherwise.\nThere are different ways to account for pricing differences so that it doesn\u2019t seem like you\u2019re giving them a discount necessarily. You can attribute the difference to the complexity level, time and materials, package services up together. Even better, if someone baulks at your price quote and you\u2019re willing to negotiate with them, you can offer to bring the price down by simplifying any of those attributes. Your rate is still your rate, but you\u2019ll be happy to adjust the scope of the work to fit their limitations.\nRaising your rates might result in losing more work, but sometimes the filter itself is a reward. It\u2019s going to take me a long time to build my network to the point where I can reliably secure the handful of $10K+ public speaking deals a year I want, but this year was a good time to start because I am getting overwhelmed with requests anyway. I can barely manage the ones I really want to do, so it\u2019s rather nice to cut back for a while.\nYou Have All the Talent You Need Today\nIt can be intimidating to ask for more, but what people get paid \u2014 especially in creative fields \u2014 often has nothing to do with their talent and everything to do with the circles they travel in. Rather than sitting around and waiting for someone to invite you to charge them more, you need to understand what you\u2019re optimizing for: do you want the work day to be filled with projects that excite you? do you want more free time? or do you just want more money? Then you have to make what you charge part of your strategy for achieving that goal.\nIt isn\u2019t easy but if you\u2019re able to build the network it is definitely worth it.", "comment_count": 3, "like_count": 198, "created_time": 1645706884862, "comment": [{"user_id": "d196ba9afc2d", "comment_time": 1645706884862, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "e2f7af90b7da", "comment_time": 1648886493509, "comment": "I'm started freelancing on Fiverr in 2020, just yesterday I change the price, so many client was gone, but my income still in the same average"}], "post_tag": ["Freelancing", "Negotiation", "Self Employed", "Business"]}, {"author": "Amy J.

As a child, when I heard myself in recordings, I\u2019d think I sounded like I was trying to be someone I wasn\u2019t (partly because I was). When my voice broke at puberty, I came to detest it even more. The deeper it got, the more I felt like my voice was an unfaithful facsimile \u2014 it identified me, but it also misrepresented me. It was too deep. It was full of masculine affectations that I\u2019d absorbed from other people to fit in. It was full of eagerness for acceptance, masking fear and insecurity. In so many ways, it felt inauthentic, forced, and fragile.\nIn adulthood, I stopped paying attention to what I hated about my voice, and started paying attention to how to use it. I learned that volume, silence, intonation, and tone were powerful channels for non-verbal communication. As a teacher and speaker, I learned to stimulate curiosity with pauses, to create confidence with baritone, and to get attention with projection. My voice, as much as I hated it, became a tool to command audiences, to demonstrate listening, and to pretend to be a man. It was still inauthentic, forced, and fragile, but in a useful way.\nMaybe changing my voice isn\u2019t really about changing anything, it\u2019s about choosing.\nBecause of my tenuous relationship with my voice, nothing scared me more about coming out as trans than transitioning my voice. My mind raced with questions every day. Should I change my voice? Can I change my voice? If I don\u2019t, will people be distracted by the disconnect between my visual presentation and my spoken one? If I do, will people recognize me? Will I recognize myself? Will it be a good voice? Will it out me? Will I lose my ability to give a great talk? Will I lose authority because of sexist gender norms about pitch and authority? And if I do change my voice, how do I change it, given the impossible triple bind of sounding like a woman, but avoiding both vocal fry and upturn? And my wife loves my voice; if I change it, will she stop loving me?\nFor a time, I thought maybe my desire to change my voice was just about not standing out. I contemplated keeping my male voice, and adopting a more genderqueer presentation. But every time I thought about this, not only did it not feel like me (I want my ideas to stand out, not me), but it also made me remember how false my male voice was to begin with. It made me wonder how false everyone\u2019s voices are: part biology, part social construction, and always evolving in response to the words, phrases, tone, and pitch of the people around us. Maybe changing my voice isn\u2019t really about changing anything, it\u2019s about choosing.\nVoices are malleable, much like how a swimmer\u2019s stroke or a runner\u2019s run is malleable.\nOf course, choosing is easier than it sounds. Vocal cord surgeries can only affect pitch, which is actually a small part of how people gender voices. Most of how we perceive gender in voices comes from other things: intonation, resonance, enunciation, rhythm, accent, word choice, and even topic. These are things we rarely notice when we\u2019re talking, and that we pick up from the people around us throughout our entire lives. Because I was conditioned to behave and present like a boy for most of my life, I picked up most of the speech patterns of boys and men; learning to speak like a woman just means learning new speech patterns.\nOf course, I didn\u2019t know a lot about this before I decided to choose my voice. The internet taught me a little (mostly bad advice), but I learned some stunning things from my wonderful vocal therapist Rebecca von Duering at Kaiser Permanente. First, voices are malleable, much like how a swimmer\u2019s stroke or a runner\u2019s run is malleable. I hadn\u2019t thought about my voice as a group of muscles that could be trained, conditioned, and coordinated in new ways, but they are. Second, she taught me that the gendered aspect of our voices is just as much about what we say as how we say it. It\u2019s horribly sexist, but in Western countries people read hesitation, uncertainty, and inquisitive upturns as female. Rebecca told me unequivocally that these were norms I didn\u2019t have to follow, but that learning them would empower me to choose when or if to follow them.\nFor about six months, I visited Rebecca weekly, learning to retrain my muscles and mind. I strengthened my ability to speak with resonance from my face, rather than my chest. I learned new ways of structuring my mouth and positioning my tongue to limit how much I use the lower, deeper end of my vocal chords. I learned new patterns of intonation, accent, and rhythm. I\u2019d practice in therapy, and by myself at home. I felt more fake than I ever had using my male voice, which was dispiriting. But I learned to think about my practice more like an actor learning a new accent, soon to be performed on camera during a 40-day shoot. It didn\u2019t feel like my voice yet, but it felt like a voice, and one I was creating for myself.\nMore than anything, I learned to use my voice with agency. I remember sitting in a Kaiser waiting area for a voice appointment one morning. I was eating a breakfast sandwich, reading email, and a young man walked up to me and sat down a little too close. He said some silly pick up line, and I looked at him, my mouth full of eggs and bread, and pointed. He said, \u201cTake your time little lady, you can talk to me.\u201d While I chewed, I asked myself: What voice do I want right now? One that invites more attention or one that scares him away? I blurted out in my most masculine voice, \u201cCan I help you?\u201d He jumped back, eyes wide, and said, \u201cWait, you a dude?\u201d to which I replied, \u201cNot really.\u201d Rather than feeling dysphoric, I felt powerful. I can scare away male attention when I need to (at least in the safety of a medical clinic surrounded by security guards), and then immediately switch back to my preferred voice.\nSince coming out, my feelings about my voice have changed. Rather than hiding my practice, and feeling fake, I want to use my new voice. Every day, all the time. Like any other physical skill, it started off feeling very effortful, forced, and unreliable. But after six weeks of practice in everyday life, it feels less like practice and more like it\u2019s just my voice. I don\u2019t love it yet, and I really have no idea how it\u2019s being gendered by other people, but I don\u2019t have to think about it before I start speaking, and most of the time I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m faking or forcing anything. And as much as I occasionally hear elements of my old voice, I feel the muscle memory for it slipping away.\nI just have a new way of using old parts.\nMy new voice still fails me regularly. After a long day of talking, or sinus troubles, or dehydration, my voice gets rougher, deeper, hoarser. And sometimes, even when my voice is great, I can hear my old voice in my speech. These moments trigger a lot of dysphoria, because it brings back memories of the voice I used to have, and how hard I worked to hide behind it. But in some ways, I recognize that this is how all womens\u2019 voices are: occasionally more masculine, occasionally overused, and occasionally a horrible mess from a cold or flu. My voice needs care and attention to be healthy and ready for use, just like my old voice did, and just like anyone else\u2019s. I just have a new way of using old parts.\nAnd despite a lot of progress, I still feel like I\u2019m at the beginning, especially professionally. I\u2019ve begun to notice how many of the women in my professional life, perhaps unknowingly, force their pitch downward, trying to claim some of the unearned authority that comes with a deeper voice. I think about the same strange games women in politics have to play with their voices to be read as authoritative, but still feminine, lest they be labeled angry or bitchy. I realize that as soon as I feel confident and consistent about using my new voice every day, I\u2019ll have to start learning a new set of rules about how to use my voice effectively as a teacher, a speaker, a collaborator, and a leader in a gendered, sexist world.\nFor now though, I\u2019m going to keep working on resonance, avoiding dark vowels, and replacing the old voice in my head with my new one. And every day, rather than feeling like I\u2019m finding my voice, I feel like I\u2019m choosing it.", "comment_count": 3, "like_count": 862, "created_time": 1573941388058, "comment": [{"user_id": "9519e0bfd8dd", "comment_time": 1573941388058, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "e07fe4ff5ebb", "comment_time": 1574621844322, "comment": "Thank you for going this in depth with such a personal journey."}, {"user_id": "37c7fa097c35", "comment_time": 1578425338278, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "d214c29d1b9a", "comment_time": 1574207742048, "comment": "I\u2019m proud of you!"}], "post_tag": ["Transgender", "Voices", "LGBTQ", "Identity", "Self"]}, {"author": "Amy J.

For decades, the religious right has desperately tried to limit our protections, our access to health care, and even our ability to pee safely. Countless youth end up homeless after coming out to their parents, with few places to be safe and affirmed. It always feels hyperbolic to say it, but I really do think the right would rather have us dead than out and ourselves.\nBut that\u2019s the story told far too often. It\u2019s one I dwell on too much, writing about the difficulty I faced coming out, and the constant whiplash of euphoria from finally being out and the devastating losses in courts. It\u2019s one that dominates headlines, with most stories focusing trans people who have lost their lives or faced adversity. It\u2019s one that parents often tell themselves when their kids come out, convincing themselves that it would be safer for their child to hide than to be out and proud. And it\u2019s even the one that the right uses as a kind of circular proof that being trans must somehow be wrong: why else would trans people\u2019s lives are so miserable?\nHere\u2019s the problem: there are a lot of happy trans kids. And I\u2019m one of them. That might sound strange coming from a 41 year old, but in a lot of ways, I feel like I\u2019m just resuming life from when I first realized something was wrong with my name, my pronouns, and my body. I have some of my first memories when I was in 3rd grade, age 8. I always had the sense that I was going to the wrong bathroom, I would play with my (boy) friends, but always be preoccupied with what the girls were doing. I would have fleeting encounters with girls in school or on the bus where they\u2019d every so briefly treat me like I was just another friend. These were all glimpses in to the life I was supposed to be living, but couldn\u2019t, since there are so many forces keeping me in my gendered place. It didn\u2019t even consider it a possibility.\nBut life at home was closer. For a time, both of my neighbors were girls. Tina and Amanda and I would spend a fair amount of time playing in their rooms while my parents did yard work. Those few hours every weekend were dreamlike. We would tell elaborate stories about the dolls and toys in their rooms, run outside, giggle and roll around in the grass in the hopelessly stereotyped way that many girls do. Beyond the gaze of parents and peers, I was free. Play with my boy friends didn\u2019t exactly feel wrong, but it wasn\u2019t liberating in the way it was Tina and Amanda.\nThirty years and much therapy later, I\u2019ve found my way back to those lost moments of childhood. On weekends I find myself rolling around on the ground with our cat, laughing hysterically at some childish humor, beaming after trying on a new top, trying ridiculous things with my hair, learning how to operate my new body. I am simultaneously 8, 18, 28, and forty something, trying to catch up after a life on pause for three decades. When I am present, I can feel deeply childish, sorting out a new social awareness. I can feel the disorientation of adolescence, trying to make sense of new sexual feelings. And I can feel the ennui of my twenties, trying to navigate my position in the world as a woman while still longing for mystery and adventure. Good or bad, each of those moments replaces three decades of numbness with bursts of punctuated joy.\nAnd while I resume my childhood, happy trans kids across the U.S. live theirs uninterrupted. Their parents love them, they have wonderful friends, they laugh, they play, and they are blissfully ignorant of the hateful world around them, because the people in their lives see them as clearly as they seem themselves. And their trans bodies, just like the bodies of all children, are a footnote to their innocence, as they should be.\nHelp protect the childhoods of trans youth: give to the Trans Week fundraiser to raise a legal fund to sue the 34 states pursuing legislation that threads to rob millions of children of their childhoods.", "comment_count": 8, "like_count": 779, "created_time": 1649036650486, "comment": [{"user_id": "9519e0bfd8dd", "comment_time": 1649036650486, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "63903a6ace49", "comment_time": 1649062671755, "comment": "It is disorienting being all those different ages at times.

A tall Danish orphan and mother of thirteen, her eyes were always wide with ideas and her body afire with action. I remember staying with her at her manufactured home in Junction City, Oregon one weekend and just standing in the middle of the living room as I watched her do dishes, bring my grandpa coffee, organize the bookshelf, make me a bath, assemble a sandwich, zipping around me as if I were a piece of furniture. My grandpa said, \u201cNina, sit with me\u201d, as he lingered far too long on a page of the newspaper in his recliner. She sat, and not two seconds later, stood up, to finish the corner of a puzzle and show me a beautiful flower at the neighbor\u2019s house. A year before she died at age 97, she still walked a mile a day and led an aerobics class. To be in her presence, even at nearly a century old, was to be in the eye of a tornado.\nMy mother is the same. When I was a child, she was up early, preparing breakfast and for her one hour commute to teach at the edge of the Columbia River, just past Portland traffic. Evenings were dinner, grading, and prep. Weekends were a flurry of chores, epic errands of landscaping and home improvement, brunch feasts, dancing to blues and jazz, gardening, planning, plotting, and more. When she retired from teaching after decades, she applied that same limitless appetite for tasks to running an Airbnb out of her basement. She was a Superhost in months, serving Intel visitors seeking a quiet retreat from corporate housing in her wooded townhouse at the edge of Portland\u2019s suburbs.\nGrowing up with these two women should have been tiring. I think for my bother and and father, who approach life a bit more leisurely, it probably was. But for me, it was inspiration. I saw their energy in myself, a boiling steam engine just waiting for a destination, and saw how they organized their lives around tasks and plans and jobs and chores and errand and goals and missions and wanted my own ventures. I mimicked my mother\u2019s paper planner in middle school, putting my attention toward school, and as a teen, toward programming. In college, I set my ambitions toward discovery and leadership, letting my task list grow and glow with even bigger ideas. And in pursuing academia, I gave myself gleefully to the daily work of reading, writing, observing, analyzing, networking, teaching, listening, and speaking. By the time I reached full Professor last year, my to do list stretched five years into the future and spanned more than five thousand tasks.\nWhile I mirrored my mother and grandmothers\u2019 endless diligence with indulgence, there were times when it seemed unhealthy. Friends would ask whether I was too busy. Mentors would tell me to take a vacation and say no more often. Partners would hint at a toxic workload. Colleagues would remark about the mysteries of my productivity. I took each hint seriously, drawing boundaries around my work time, planning vacations, and keeping my weekends clear. Most months, I still only work 45 hours a week. But it feels like damming a river, holding the waters back to my batteries with hydroelectricity.\nBut my freed evenings, weekends, and vacations are anything but tranquil. I find myself starting side projects, organizing my room, upgrading my house, starting a software project, finding a community, happily doing all of the house chores, and writing for fun. I remember laying on the beach in Hawaii with my wife one winter, and while she quietly relished a sunburn and napped, I lay on my back writing furiously in a notebook about a new idea I was obsessed with. Creating space for rest from work only made space for more joyful labor.\nThe closest I came to stillness was the first time I meditated. My ex and I were at a Unitarian Universalist sermon in Corvallis, trying to find community as we braced ourselves for young parenthood. The pastor had given us a seemingly simple task: quiet our minds for five minutes. I remember embracing the challenging and thinking \u201cKeep going Amy, you\u2019re doing great, you\u2019re not thinking about anything!\u201d My mind was not empty, but it was focused deeply on being empty. That was the first time I saw the source of my propulsion: another me inside, an Amy cheering me on, coaching me, watching me work, and nudging me to do more, better. She is every teacher, every parent, every mentor, speaking in one voice, keeping me on task, the kind of supervisor everyone wishes they had.\nThis does not seem sustainable. It does not feel like stress, but if it is, I have a heart attack coming. On the other hand, I share blood with the only other two people I\u2019ve known that have such endless energy and one lived to 97, the other is living a long healthy retirement. And I love it all; every task, every project, every goal, and can\u2019t wait to take on more. Is it possible that I can just keep doing without consequence, especially after two years of pandemic, gender transition, and major surgery?\nThis Spring quarter, which starts this week, seems like a test to find out. My commitments will keep me busy at work for 10\u201312 hours a day, far beyond my normal work/life boundaries of 8\u20139 hours. I expect weekend work too. I will be teaching two classes (one of them with 200 students and 8 TAs), directing an undergraduate program, launching a masters program, running a lab with two postdocs, four doctoral students, and dozens of undergraduates, leading an K-12 education advocacy group, finishing a book, starting a book, writing a grant, editing an academic journal, traveling to four conferences and meetings, planning a workshop in Germany, engineering a book publishing platform for fun, and probably writing more blog posts when I\u2019m bored.\nAnd then, suddenly, I will be on sabbatical in June. It seems like what I\u2019ll need most after 12 weeks of life at the limit is rest and recovery, to heal whatever wounds I incur while occupied, numbed by adrenaline. But if my past and the women in my life are any hint, by June I will be just as restless as ever. For now, the only question is whether I should feel guilty about that, forcing myself to be still, or just accept that busyness is just my way of being.\nThere are many ways of being. If you read this and feel imposter syndrome (e.g., \u201cIs this what it takes to be a professor?\u201d), remember that there are so many ways that people engage work \u2014 and all of them are valid, necessary, and needed, especially in academia, which thrives on neurodiversity. This is just me trying to sort out whether my particular way, which really feels more nature than nurture, is sustainable and healthy. I\u2019m still not sure\u2026", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 31, "created_time": 1648421720911, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Tasks", "Busyness", "Work Life Balance", "Productivity"]}, {"author": "Amy J. Ko", "post_id": "79b17ff6be5e", "user_id": "9519e0bfd8dd", "title": "A visit to Ann Arbor to discuss equity, justice, and engineering education", "content": "The front entrance of Weill Hall, home to the Ford School.\nA visit to Ann Arbor to discuss equity, justice, and engineering education\nIt\u2019s been a long two years of sheltering in my home office. It\u2019s just been me, my cat, and my wife (who has basically been working two years of overtime as a nurse). Traveling was out of the question, both to protect ourselves, my immunocompromised daughter, and our immunocompromised parents. I survived, but I think my professional network, mostly decayed, as the opportunities to connect disappeared.\nIn the past month, things have felt a bit safer. Cases have been down across the U.S., vaccines are abundant, and the few professional networking opportunities that I\u2019ve wanted to do have been vaccine mandatory-affairs. I came back from SIGCSE 2022, for example, feeling well, with no reports of positive cases, and on a wonderful high of serendipitous conversation and connection around ideas.\nIt\u2019s not clear that this is going to last. There are signs of another wave coming soon. My daughter and parent-in-law\u2019s immunity is not yet stable. And, paradoxically, most of the U.S. is abandoning the very protections that have kept cases on the decline. And so it felt strange this morning, heading to the airport to visit the University of Michigan to speak on a panel and do more networking. Is this the responsible thing to do? Am I putting others at risk? How will Ann Anbor\u2019s masking and vaccination be relative to Seattle\u2019s? I really had no idea, given how much is in flux.\nBut heading to Michigan was strange in another way. My last visit there was in 2017, where I visited folks in CSE and the iSchool. But so much has changed in the past five years:\nI\u2019m Amy now.\nTwo leading computing education researchers, Mark Guzdial and Barb Erickson are now at Michigan, after moving from Georgia Tech in 2018.\nCS and the School of Information have numerous new faculty and some problematic faculty are no longer there.\nI do equity, justice, and policy now, and not just programming.\nOh, and there\u2019s an ongoing global pandemic, war in Europe, a war against trans youth in the U.S., and record inflation.\nAnd so my visit in 2017 and my visit in 2022 were bound to be different. First and foremost, it wasn\u2019t colleagues in HCI and Computing Education who invited me. Rather, it was the Ford School of Public Policy\u2019s Science, Technology, and Public Policy center, asking me to join a panel titled, \u201cCultivating socially responsible engineers: The role of universities and public policy\u201d, where I would share my perspectives on how to bring topics of equity and justice into engineering education. And rather than visiting with a medley of HCI researchers, my two day visit was full of them, but also an entirely new community of public policy, engineering education, and computing education researchers. Pandemic or not, I was excited.\nWeill Hall, home to the Ford School of Public Policy and STPP.\nMonday\nAfter a quiet Sunday evening post-flight, I rose Monday morning for a coffee with two childhood friends I hadn\u2019t seen for more than 13 years who now live in Ann Arbor. (Hi Brian and Ursula!). We had a great time catching up, filling in the gaps in our sparse Facebook-fragmented glimpse into each others\u2019 lives. I was so grateful to reconnect and hear about their new home and new jobs.\nAfter, I met Kristin Burgard, STPP\u2019s new Outreach and Partnership Manager, for a casual walk to Weill Hall to settle into my visitor office. It turns out that Kristin grew up in Pittsburgh on possibly the same block I lived in during graduate school. We reminisced about 100 year old homes, the Swissvale school and playground, and I oriented a bit to the Weill hall layout.\nAfter a few minutes getting cozy in my office, I had a lovely meeting with Jos\u00e9 Zayas Castro, the head of NSF\u2019s Division of Engineering Education and Centers. Jos\u00e9 has had a medley of professor, chair, and dean roles and recently joined NSF full time. We chatted about the many challenges and opportunities with doing department, university, and field level community organizing. I was particularly intrigued by how he characterized the two main challenges as resources and leadership. We discussed this in the context of some of the overlap between engineering education and computing education, and the tensions between making space for discipline-based education research progress and trans-disciplinary, boundary spanning progress. He predicted that it would take interdisciplinary leaders to reconcile that tension.\nNext I met with STPP faculty affiliate and research scientist Denia Djoki\u0107, who studies social and environmental justice aspects of the governance of nuclear energy technology. Denia talked about her journey through nuclear engineering, to where she is now, trying to engineering discourse move beyond more superficial rhetoric about clean energy to deeper framings around justice and exploitation. In our conversation, we found so many fascinating overlaps between computing and nuclear engineering: 1) solutions, 2) engineering neutrality, 3) a focus on triage and repair over refusal to build, and 4) the way in which computing and nuclear engineering both have hidden structural dependencies that only become visible in failure. But we also talked about some of the disciplinary differences. For example, computing is very much in public conversation, creating pressure; it is also a younger discipline, with an orientation towards change, which creates space for conversations about changing what is taught and how it is taught. Denia noted that nuclear engine, in contrast, is largely invisible to the public, and so any pressure that exists is primarily internal, making change even harder. The most interesting idea we encountered was the the pedagogical shifts required in all of this: it\u2019s not just about teaching different things, but deconstructing students\u2019 identities, which are often defined by solutionism and neutrality. How does one help students\u2019 embrace the disciplines as ones that permit refusal, while preserving their motivation to participate in the discipline?\nAfter a short break, I met with STPP faculty affiliate Ben Green, a postdoc with a background in CS, but who now focuses on social and political impacts of algorithms in government. We explored the need for algorithmic bias discourse to be more focused on the systems of incentives and governance and less on technologies themselves, but also on the requisite literacies for decision makers to be able to effectively manage public technology investments. We talked about, for example, how many technologies are only effective when deployed well and with expertise, and how many cities are not positioned to execute deployments with those skills, ultimately leading to poorer quality outcomes. We lamented the lack of efficacy studies about the risks and failures of technologies, rather than on best case deployments.\nI then had a wonderful lunch with postdoc Johanna Okerlund, who has been studying how to incorporate ethics and justice throughout Computer Science curriculum, and Electrical and Computer Engineering PhD student Trever Odenberg. The three of us were at substantially different places at our careers, Trever just navigating the disparate links between computer engineering and public policy, Johanna just having wrapped up a public policy postdoc at STPP after starting in CS and HCI, and myself nearly 20 years in to a career studying programming, learning, and belonging. But we found common ground around the many challenges of participating in emerging interdisciplinary spaces: the risks, the difficulty building community, and but also the great opportunities. Much of the advice I gave centered around finding others with shared interests to take risks with, but also the privilege I have in saying that, as a tenured professor. This also connected to our experiences trying to help undergraduates navigate the tensions between doing the work they want to do at the intersection of technology and justice and the work they can be paid handsomely to do (e.g., making Google Search a bit faster).\nI had the afternoon before the panel free, but with a few research meetings. I met briefly with some colleagues in psychometrics and AI to sort out trajectories for a grant that examines how to use AI for equitable CS assessments. I synced with my research-practice partnership team on the launch of our new CS endorsement in our College of Education\u2019s Secondary Teacher Education Program. I coordinated on some of the final projects on our programming strategies work with my colleague Thomas LaToza at George Mason. And I submitted Winter quarter grades for my class, User Interface Software and Technology. It was strange doing my faculty job from a visitor\u2019s office in a School of Public Policy!\nI headed down for the panel around 4pm, which was held in the beautful Betty Ford auditorium. It went by quickly, even though it was 90 minutes of talking and Q&A. We covered a lot of ground, including the many diverse perspectives we spoke from, our thoughts on equity and justice pedagogy for engineering, the structural and cultural issues we see for change, the tensions between bottom up and top down change, the role for students to play in advocating for change, and more. I found Johanna\u2019s points about the need to teach engineering humility particularly compelling, Associate Dean for Undergraduate Education Tim McCay\u2019s points about orchestrating cross-disciplinary co-teaching promising, and Jose\u2019s points about bringing communities through funding essential. Dean of Engineering Alec Gallimore was a fantastic moderator, making room for everyone\u2019s perspectives. I did my usual shtick, talking about identity, belonging, faculty professional development, and capitalism. I also said something about every solution being a problem (in reference to the engineering mindset of every problem having a solution). You can see the full panel here:\nThe panel recording.\nThe day ended with dinner at a cute Korean restaurant called Miss Kim, with the panelists and Shobita Parthasarathy, who studies comparative and international politics and policy related to science and technology, and STPP managing director Molly Kleinman. Shobita and Molly were our STPP hosts and I got to sit next to them throughout dinner, talking about engineering culture, computer science culture, public policy culture, interdisciplinarity, leadership, power, Autism, trans issues, and more. It was lovely company and a wonderful way to end a stimulating day!\nThe panelists, Shobita, Molly, and I eat tasty Korean street food.\nTuesday\nOn my second day, Mark Guzdial arranged an eclectic schedule of HCI, Programming Languages, and Computing Education faculty. After a brisk walk to return the visitor room key I forgot to leave in Weill, I checked out and met Mark for breakfast. We had a far ranging conversation about academic program administration, faculty cat herding, academic cults that grow around different theoretical perspectives, and the joy of trying to create computational media that resonate with specific groups, rather than claiming to be universal. Mark also showed me the view of North campus, where CS resides a few miles away from central campus.\nUMich\u2019s north campus.\nI then met Assistant Professor Cyrus Omar, who works on innovative interfaces for programming languages. This is a topic I worked in back in the early 2000\u2019s and still have a lot of fond interest in. I was excited to hear that Cyrus and his PhD students were building upon some of my work, but also going well past it, inventing new structured editing paradigms that ensure well-formed programs while also enabling seamless editing. We talked about some of the contexts in which meeting these constraints could be particularly valuable, such as collaborative editing contexts, and also ways to allow for ill-formed structure, but incentivize quick repair (like much more aggressive syntax error messages).\nAfter meeting with Cyrus and his students, I met with a group of four of Steven Oney\u2019s PhD students, April Wang, Lei Zhang, Ashley Zhang, and Rebecca Krosnick. We talked a bit about their fascinating work on programming interfaces for collaboration, data science, web macros, VR, and AR, all of which go far beyond the kinds of conventional programming that most research has explored (including mine). We also talked about the many tensions between making research prototypes and having impact; I shared my perspectives on viewing prototypes as knowledge and focusing on how they might impact what others build, rather than worrying about trying to reach scale ourselves without sufficient resources.\nAfterwards I met with PhD student Jane Im, who is exploring how to make online spaces safer. We had a wide ranging conversation about the relationship between safety, consent, and computing literacy, exploring the ways in which literacy might change the kind of consent that users demand, the kinds of consent that designers and engineers offer, and the kinds of collective expectations that the public has about safety online.\nNext I met with Assistant Professor Xu Wang, who studies the intersection of learning, HCI, and AI. Xu shared her many creative explorations into question generation and HCI education scaffolding, applying many data and machine learning driven techniques to try to automate some of the many tasks involved in supporting active learning in CS education, HCI education, and education more broadly. We talked about the many challenges that automated techniques face in supporting students at the margins and some of the methods in HCI that might be more amenable to streamlining, including some of the work to appear by my student Alannah Oleson on assumption ideation.\nNext was Mark\u2019s PhD students, Tamara Nelson-Fromm (who studies non-computing professionals conceptions of CS concepts), Emma Doodo (who has just begun studying multilingual programming), and Bahare Naimipour (who is leading some of Mark\u2019s work on teaspoon languages in social sciences). All three talked about the challenges of interdisciplinary; I shared my experiences finding and making community around interdisciplinary subjects and encouraged them to begin to bring together everyone as a virtual community on top of the many departments engaged in computing education work.\nMy \u201cuntalk\u201d lunch with faculty and students broadly interested in programming and computing education.\nAs it turns out, my visit and lunch was exactly that opportunity: many of the folks I\u2019d met, as well as other faculty and students, joined for lunch. I declined to give a talk \u2014 I was too short on prep time, alas \u2014 and so instead I offered to give a lunch \u201cun-talk\u201d, speaking impromptu for 10 minutes and then having a group conversation. I talked about my journey from programming productivity, to learning programming, to liberatory and justice-focused computing education, explaining the need for critical consciousness about computing in society and the role of teachers in fostering this. After giving several examples, we had a conversation about the many changes of enacting social change, from classrooms to curriculum to communities. I called upon many of the faculty to take a stand against some of the neoliberal encroachment of industry on classrooms, by setting demands if industry wants access to recruiting fairs, for example, or by changing their classroom environments.\nAfter lunch, Mark drove me and two other students (Aadarsh Padiyath and my former undergraduate Anne Drew Hu, now a PhD student at Michigan State) back to North Quad, where I first met with Kaiwen Sun, who studies HCI, children, smart homes, and privacy. She was actually in Bellevue, ironically, across the lake from my home in Seattle. She shared fascinating ideas about how much control to offer children and the kinds of knowledge they need to use access control safely. We talked about the different literacies around safety, computing, and AI, and how distinguishing them isn\u2019t always helpful in learning, as many of the ways that people experience them are as intersecting and holistic.\nI then spoke to Assistant Professor Barb Ericson, who has long led broadening participation efforts and recently pivoted to research, studying CS assessment, learning analytics, and (not surprisingly) broadening participation. Barb and I talked about the transition back to campus, the struggles with teaching diverse prior knowledge, the opportunities and challenges with hybrid, and the many work/life balance tensions that emerge in faculty life (especially as parents).\nAfterwards, I met with Aardarsh Padityah, iSchool PhD student with interests in AI literacy. He shared some of his emerging work on finding ways to make space for equity and justice perspectives in conventional forms of CS education through writing, helping groups often marginalized in CS to find space to explore these issues in dominant structures. We talked about the ways that equity and justice learning might need to be differentiated based on people\u2019s identities and positions in society (e.g., privileged white men probably need different lessons that transfer students of color).\nAfter, I caught up with Gabi Marcu, Assistant Professor in the iSchool, who studies digital health interventions. We hadn\u2019t seen each other for years, since she was a PhD student. We talked about grant writing, career proposals, and in support of her developing CAREER proposal idea, the differences between experience reports on teaching and research on teaching, and the many kinds of professional development necessary for supporting teaching.\nMy last meeting was with Assistant Professor Nazanin Andalibi, who studies emotions, identity, and social computing. Naz also had grant writing on the mind, and so I shared some of the jigsaw puzzle metaphors I use to think evaluate proposals (great proposals are almost finished puzzles with significant but interesting missing pieces and a compelling final image; bad ones have pieces that don\u2019t fit and a boring picture). We also talked about the numerous intersections between privacy, surveillance, and literacy.\nWell, Naz wasn\u2019t quite my last meeting: Assistant Professor Oliver Haimson, who studies social computing and trans technologies, was generous and drove me to the airport. We talked about his fascinating interview project on trans technologies, the book he is planning on writing about them and their creators, and the many fascinating methodological and positionality questions in doing research on trans issues and content moderation.\nAnd then I had McDonald\u2019s at the airport, because that\u2019s all that was open.\nReflections\nLike many of my visits during the pandemic, one thing was clear: the discourse in CS, the discourse in iSchools, and the discourse on social sciences such as public policy, are incredibly far apart. CS is still largely framed as a problem solving discipline, and struggling to make space for other epistemologies and other people. The iSchool sits in the middle, with faculty that have exposure to these broader critical perspectives in computing, but also a foot in computing, trying to reconcile their tensions and find space for both in classrooms and faculty decisions. And public policy, a new field for me, is deeply engaged in asking critical, often radical questions around power and governance, but only recently engaging data and algorithms as a source of power.\nThat I had the opportunity to connect with all three of these communities and find clear intersections between their concerns is a testament to interdisciplinarity. And yet, at the same time, I\u2019m one of the few on this trip that really got to connect all three \u2014 I think perhaps my former undergrad Anne Drew was the only one I saw in all three spaces. And so while Michigan is beginning to bring these groups together in conversation to meet with me, I wonder about its capacity to bring these groups together in conversation with each other. That\u2019s not to say that I\u2019m doing it any better, or that my institution is; rather, I think Michigan just reflects all of the challenges that universities have in fully grappling with the transdisciplinary ideas like equity and justice in inherently disciplinary structures. I hope I can come back in 5 years and find an even more radically different changes!", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 78, "created_time": 1647743795742, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["University Of Michigan", "Equity", "Justice", "Computing Education"]}, {"author": "Stephen Moore", "post_id": "7ac31bc39eef", "user_id": "58c587b768b6", "title": "What It Takes to Go from $0 to $1 Million in Less Than One Year", "content": "What It Takes to Go from $0 to $1 Million in Less Than One Year\nThere\u2019s no \u201csecret sauce\u201d \u2014 it just requires going through these same boring steps\nPhoto by Jose Murillo on Unsplash\nI came across an individual who figured out how to start a successful business from zero multiple times.\nNo resources, no capital, no investors.\nHis name is Michael Sherman, a Long Island native. He launched his latest business LetterDash in July 2018. One year later, he says his business is on track to pull in over $100,000 in revenue in July 2019.\nPreviously, he started a handful of other businesses, including Qualified Impressions, which reached $2M per year before decline, Penalty Be Gone, $500,000 before decline, and Great Agencies, $100,000 per year.\nI was intrigued to know what his process looks like: what, exactly, does he do to build these companies?\nSo I reached out, and picked his brain over a chat. Here\u2019s what he said.\nMichael Sherman\u2019s Story\nMichael Sherman, CEO of LetterDash\nWhen I ask Michael to define what he does, he says that he\u2019s not sure what to call his \u201cprofession.\u201d\nBefore becoming what he is today, he gave the 9\u20135 a shot \u2014 about 10 times.\nHis r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of jobs is varied. In no particular order, he has done door-to-door sales selling vacuums, worked at Home Depot and McDonalds, became a licensed investment banker, tried his hand at computer tech, and even became a licensed bartender.\nHis education is no different. Michael transferred in and out of a total of five different universities before finally graduating, and that was all after dropping out of high school.\nNothing gave him the excitement or passion he craved. So he took a different path \u2014 entrepreneurship \u2014 and never looked back.\nEach business Michael built achieved a healthy profit \u2014 and he did that with nothing more than his brain, a laptop, and a couple of Google Ads coupons.\nHis latest company, LetterDash, an on-demand legal letter sending service, just turned one year old. Michael shared some of the financial figures from the year so far \u2014\nJuly 7, 2018 \u2014 spent $18; generated a single lead; generated $4,000 during month 1.\nAugust \u2014 about $11,000.\nJanuary \u2014 about $56,000.\nMay 2019 \u2014 about $79,000.\nJune 2019 \u2014 about $105,000.\nJuly 2019 \u2014 Over $100,000 (final numbers aren\u2019t in yet).\nBut Michael has gained far more than just money from LetterDash. The experience has been full of learning, and below he shares the lessons you can learn from his journey.\n1. Don\u2019t Rush to Raise Capital\nWhen he started LetterDash, he didn\u2019t need or want to raise capital. He explained that raising capital only adds layers of complications and pressure.\n\u201cThese pressures come in many forms \u2014 pressure to grow fast, pressure to hire, pressure to put up numbers.\u201d\nAnd this pressure can lead to bad decisions, he warns.\nIn the end, he started the business with a bank account of zero, no framework, and no plan.\nThere was nothing but an idea. He says that all you need in the early days is the commitment to grow from there.\n2. Don\u2019t Rush Into Development\nMichael learned this lesson the hard way. He invested heavily in building software applications for previous companies and all of the businesses failed miserably.\nHe had learned that the software produced was never the problem. The problem was that he had focused solely on his vision and on how it would be executed, before figuring out who the software was for.\nIn the case of LetterDash, he says that the software they would have developed would have automated the interactions between the client, LetterDash, and the attorney.\nBut now that the company is up and running, he sees that it would have been completely useless, and was able to dedicate resources elsewhere.\nHis advice?\n\u201cGet customers first, build your software later. It\u2019s cool to say you have software, it\u2019s much cooler to say you have revenue from paying customers.\u201d\n3. Start Small \u2026and Boring\nGetting to a million is never easy. It might be easy for the Elon Musks of the world, those with deep connections and vast resources, who can spend millions in advertising and infrastructure.\nFor all the Michael Shermans out there, it\u2019s easier said than done.\nHe said his approach to building LetterDash was boring and straightforward.\n\u201cWe spent about 15 minutes of keyword research using the Google Ads Keyword Tool. There was enough search volume being reported to warrant the green light and test the idea. We came up with a business name, found a cheap .co domain and threw up a very basic, yet credible looking website.\u201d\nThis is a point worth emphasizing. The purpose of the website is to generate leads and validate demand. If both of these are ticked, there is scope to build bigger down the line.\n\u201cWe spent about $100 on web development. We found a Google Ads coupon, I believe it was $100 free for spending $25, we put together a barebones ad campaign and started sending traffic to the site. Twenty-four hours later, we received our first client request. A week later, we had a dozen requests.\u201d\nThis was the indicator he was looking for, and he was now ready to hire some attorneys and begin scaling.\n4. You Need to Obsessively Tweak\n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t a single action or moment that led to success or the $1M in revenue. I\u2019d say there might have literally been a million little tweaks and ideas tested along the way.\u201d\nMichael says that as they received customer feedback, they began to analyze the success of the letters being sent out by one attorney to another. As they went through responses to the attorneys\u2019 letters, they continuously tested new\nideas.\n\u201cWe\u2019re constantly tweaking and optimizing the letterheads, the shipping method, the packaging, the presentation, even the language used by the attorneys in the letters.\u201d\nThat same customer feedback led to the formulation of new products and ancillary services that significantly boosted company revenue, without having to worry about new user acquisition costs.\n\u201cListening to the customers, what they want and what they need after the primary service was delivered has been key.\u201d\n5. Invest in Customer Success\nCustomers are everything. Their feedback and word of mouth are critical to expanding your client base, and in being able to improve and expand your service.\nWith LetterDash, customer service has played a major role in the growth of the company.\n\u201cThe many 18 hour workdays and time we spent focusing on each tiny thing to make sure the customer was blown away by the service have all been a major factor in our explosive growth and ability to reach that $1M milestone,\u201d says Michael.\nThe biggest lesson here is to focus on customers\u2019 feedback and to use it to improve your service. You must always be focused on making sure every customer is a satisfied one, even when in reality that likely cannot be achieved.\n\u201cMy Advice Is Nothing Unique\u201d\nYou might have noticed that the advice Michael offers is nothing unique. You\u2019ve likely seen a lot of it before. And that\u2019s exactly the point. As he said himself, it\u2019s boring and straightforward.\nBut this means it\u2019s replicable. It\u2019s a process that anyone can follow to achieve similar successes.\nThe key takeaway here for entrepreneurs is this: Don\u2019t focus or obsess on anything other than validating demand for your product or solution. In the end, nothing else matters if you don\u2019t have a market.\nIf you want to read more of my work, or the work of the many, many great writers on this platform, consider becoming a member.

Others couldn\u2019t help but be completely baffled at the absurdity of all of it. I fall into the latter, struggling to process the fact that someone spent $2.9 million on a digital certificate that serves as proof of ownership for a tokenized version of a tweet that says \u201c just setting up my twttr,\u201d while the tweet itself still lives on Twitter, and the owner of said tweet could delete it, or make further NFTs of it.\nStill, the pointlessness of it didn\u2019t appear to bother Estavi. Shortly after winning the auction, he did little to play down his bullishness for the future of the NFT. In an entirely-serious tweet, he wrote, \u201cI think years later people will realize the true value of this tweet, like the Mona Lisa painting.\u201d\nWell, just one year later, a different reality has set in.\nWhen Beeple\u2019s \u2018Everydays \u2014 The First 5000 Days\u2019 digital artwork sold at a first-of-its-kind auction for $69,346,250, it triggered a frenzied gold rush. People were turning to everything and anything and minting them into NFTs, slapping on some line about community or immeasurable value, and selling them to buyers who were eager to snap them up at a \u2018low\u2019 price and sell them to the next eager buyer. When Jack Dorsey minted his first tweet and put it up for auction, it was right at the beginning of this purple patch. NFT interest was skyrocketing, floor prices were rising, and the media was feeding the hype train. On reflection, as crazy as it sounds, the $2.9 million price tag made sense in that hyped-up climate.\nSo on April 6, when Estavi put the NFT back up for auction on OpenSea at a brain-melting price of $48 million, he was probably looking forward to making his money back (and then some) and relaxing in the knowledge that being stuck with a pointless digitalized tweet would soon become someone else\u2019s problem.\nBut Estavi has misjudged the current market. Just over 12 months after his initial purchase, the boom has gone a little bust. Search traffic has fallen around 60\u201370%. The floor price is way down. The entire NFT market cap has dropped from a high of $23 billion to around $10 billion, losing over half its value. Then, there\u2019s the increased regulatory scrutiny, the countless scams, and the far-too-many projects that have done nothing but fatten the wallets of the creators.\nIn sum, it\u2019s a very different landscape to the one a year ago.\nBy the time the auction closed on April 13, just seven offers were made, the highest of which was 0.09 ETH (around $280). The lowest was 0.0019 ETH, around $6. Since the auction closed, several offers have come in, though a far cry from the asking price. If Esatvi accepts the current highest bid, which stands at $6,823.54, he\u2019ll get a whopping 0.2% of what he paid for it (and even less if he donates the half he promised to charity.) It should be noted that Estavi is not obliged to sell the NFT. Speaking to CoinDesk, he said, \u201cThe deadline I set was over, but if I get a good offer, I might accept it, I might never sell it.\u201d\nNo one wants a 99% loss on their CV, so he will likely choose to \u2018hodl\u2019 with his \u2018diamond hands,\u2019 while praying the market hits another hot patch, and joining the community in trying to drive up hype and invent demand.\nBut he could be waiting a long while.\nThe NFT market is a bit of a mess at present, and is undergoing a resetting of expectations. Prices for most of the assets are now too high for entry-level buyers (and the potential profit from resale is less guaranteed), meaning the potential audience for those with digital assets to sell is shrinking. As result of this is that a lot of the buying and selling now goes on between the same communities (or worse, engaging in wash-trading, where sales occur between accounts linked to the same person). So what is the true market value at present? It\u2019s hard to gauge, and harder to predict whether it will recover.\nAnd while I feel like a broken record writing this, the market will always struggle to cement itself until it solves its major problem: finding real, tangible use-cases for the NFTs that can justify the ludicrous values they demand.\nIf you want to read more of my work, or the work of the many, many great writers on this platform, consider becoming a member.

For a time, they were the only company that could make online shopping so easy, and the frictionless payments helped the company scoop up over 40% of the US commerce market. When the patent eventually expired in September 2017, entrepreneurs sensed an opportunity for disruption.\nAnd disrupt they did. Shopify built its own payment system for users of its e-commerce network. Giants like Apple and Google developed their own one-click payment systems, which are proving successful on mobile devices. PayPal created One Touch. Stripe released a one-touch update to its Checkout feature. In sum, one-click payments were becoming a commodity. Yet, it did little to deter the world of scrappy startups; the biggest splash was made by Bolt, valued at an eye-watering $11 billion as of early this year.\nAnd then, there was Fast.\nFast is like Bolt in that it\u2019s a one-click payment system that can be integrated into websites and services. And thanks to its charismatic (read: egotistical) founder, the startup raised over $125 million and was speeding towards Unicorn status, despite a lack of profit and users. But as quickly as the rollercoaster hit the heights, it began to plummet when several issues came to light. When investors failed to offer up money in the latest funding round, Fast checked out for good.\nAs always, among the ashes of the company\u2019s failure are many lessons that entrepreneurs can learn to avoid becoming the next short-lived startup.\nA larger-than-life founder is no longer enough\nAdam Neumann. Elizabeth Holmes. Travis Kalanick.\nTime after time, founders with huge personalities and unbreakable egos have blitzed through an industry, sucking up VC money left and right on nothing more than their charisma and ability to sell a dream.\nThen slowly but surely, the real effects \u2014 and damage \u2014 of their ego drip feed out in the world; private jets, lavish spending, lack of care for the product/service or employees\u2019 well-being, etc. Fast was no different; as the company began to struggle financially, the CEO, Domm Holland, often skipped important meetings to go sky diving. It has recently been revealed that Holland had agreed to pay the Chainsmokers $1 million, despite earning less than that in revenue. In the end, he was all personality, all show, no product.\nA big personality coupled with storytelling skills might get you in the door, but now that investors have seen the consequences of relying on these skills alone, you will have to deliver the fundamentals \u2014 growth and revenue \u2014 soon enough.\nDifferentiate or die\nBolt and Fast were almost identical, with the main separator being an unproven claim by Holland that their system was more modern and easier to use than the competition.\nBut Bolt had 10 million users and a valuation of $11 billion. It was also making money. It was leaps and bounds ahead of Fast, and the data showed it.\nTo justify its presence and convince brands and services to drop Bolt, Fast needed to define a true USP. It failed. As a result, investors realized they\u2019d be throwing money at a losing cause.\nWhen you\u2019re fighting a congested market, especially one filled with big players, your need to separate yourself from the crowd. If your product is similar to your competitors, you need to define why you are going to be better at executing than they are. It can\u2019t just be the people. Or just simply saying you\u2019re \u201cbetter.\u201d Think about what skills you have that they don\u2019t or what advantages you hold. If you can\u2019t define these, trouble lies ahead: you can only rely on branding, splashy marketing \u2014 or your eccentric founder \u2014 for so long.\nGrowth at sustainable costs\nAfter banking its $102 million Series B in Jan 2021, Fast ramped up its spending. After all, it says it in the founder\u2019s playbook \u2014 you\u2019ve got to spend to grow. Right?\nBy the time the company shut its doors, monthly spending had reached $10 million, a far cry from the $600K it was making in a year. Money flew out on partnerships, deals with sports teams, celebrities, lavish parties, and extensive hiring. On one day alone in November 2021, the team grew by a staggering 42% (jumping from 337 to 480.)\nFast\u2019s main competitor, Bolt, had also been growing at rapid speed. But rather than focus solely on its main service, it had been expanding into fraud protection and other financial services, becoming a hybrid payments-and-software company and, more importantly, increasing its bottom line. The move allowed for sustainable expansion, more revenue-generating opportunities and differentiated the service from rivals.\nWhen spending gets reckless, the only way to keep the lights on is aggressive growth strategies, seeking more and more funding, or improving the business model. The first two will always leave you at risk of falling off the cliff edge.\nThe easy-money train is slowing\n2021 was a record year for venture capital investment, and Fast was one of the many beneficiaries of easily accessible money. Yet, as 2022 develops, a slowdown is underway. According to CB Insights, Global venture funding dropped 19% from Q4 2021 to the first quarter of this year \u2014 the steepest drop in at least four years, while the number of companies achieving \u201cunicorn\u201d status fell to a five-quarter low.\nPolitical unrest, the lingering effects of the pandemic, and economic uncertainty; none of it adds up to an environment for free-flowing investment. As a result, investors will want to be more certain their investment is a smart one, which means more thorough due diligence. For entrepreneurs, that means you can no longer throw together a pitch deck that says you\u2019ll be making $10 billion in a year\u2019s time \u2014 you\u2019ll need more evidence and data to back up your claims.\nOn the plus side, this slightly calmer environment is a bonus for entrepreneurs. Not having that pressure to constantly raise means founders can focus on building their companies.\nAnd if you\u2019re a good company, there will be no problems raising funds. Speaking to Forbes, Mark Goldberg, a partner at Index Ventures, said, \u201cI think for the top 5% or 10% of companies, nothing changes from last year. If you are an exceptional business you are unaffected by the macro conditions.\u201d\nBonus: Enough with the Yogababble\nIn a statement released after news broke of Fast\u2019s end, Holland talked of his mission to \u201cdemocratize commerce,\u201d referred to his startup as a \u2018trailblazer,\u2019 and the journey to the \u201cmountain top.\u201d\nWhile it\u2019s not in the same category of cringe as \u201celevating the world\u2019s consciousness,\u201d the market is growing tired of founders trying to spin their company and its mission into something more than it is.\nWhen defining your company mission, speak from the heart and on a level that your market understands.\nIf you want to read more of my work, or the work of the many, many great writers on this platform, consider becoming a member.

In particular, fast food brands have been desperately scrambling to join in but are quickly discovering a lack of use-cases in the crossover between digital assets and fast food. The result has been a host of unnecessary NFT projects, like McDonald\u2019s Big Mac Rubik\u2019s Cube, Taco Bells Taco GIFS, and Pizza Hut\u2019s 1 Byte Favourites. I mean, who wouldn\u2019t want to boast about owning a pixelated slice of pizza?\nNow, the brands are at it again, falling over themselves in a frenzy to join the Metaverse, and are beginning to deliver equally unnecessary projects.\nOn April 2, Wendy\u2019s opened the virtual doors to the \u2018Wendyverse,\u2019 and gave us a glimpse at what the digital fast-food world will look like. The company has teamed up with Meta to launch the project, which features a virtual restaurant located in a Wendy-branded virtual town square. Users can walk around (Read: float around), interacting with a virtual Fanta soda stream and a virtual basketball court, where users can shoot hoops with a virtual \u2018Baconator.\u2019 (At least this one is a far healthier version.)\nThe catch? There\u2019s nothing to eat in this fast food joint.\nWhen you can\u2019t order food, either for the real world or digitally, the whole concept appears to be a case of trying to fit a square peg into a round hole.\nNonetheless, Wendy\u2019s is confident that the project, described as the \u201cfirst phase\u201d of its Metaverse strategy, is a worthwhile endeavor. In a statement, chief marketing officer Carl Loredo said, \u201cTruly a first of its kind, the Wendyverse bridges the best of today with tomorrow to show up for our fans across every world \u2014 with a Frosty and fries in hand.\u201d\nWhat the project will look like once finished is anyone\u2019s guess; perhaps users can order through the virtual world and have it delivered to their home? Or will the future avatars need the same necessities in the digital world that real humans need, like food, water and sleep? Will this pave the way for jobs as virtual workers, serving those within the Metaverse? Whatever form it takes, we won\u2019t know for some time. Meta\u2019s VP of Metaverse, Vishal Shah, believes the full vision may be \u201cyears away.\u201d\nMcDonald\u2019s has already applied for 10 metaverse-related patents, including exploring the possibility of delivering food online and in-person and selling more NFTs. It seems delivery drivers will have to get used to people answering the door in an Oculus headset. Panera filed a trademark the day before McDonald\u2019s for similar services, including entertainment, NFTs, a Metaverse rewards program, and the ownership of the \u2018Paneraverse\u2019 name. Yum! Brands, which owns several fast-food brands, has submitted multiple trademark applications for NFT and metaverse products and services. Chipotle is already advertising in the Metaverse through the popular Roblox gaming platform. The rest will follow. Speaking to Forbes, trademark lawyer Josh Gerben noted, \u201cI think you\u2019re going to see every brand that you can think of making these filings within the next 12 months.\u201d\nBut it still begs the question\u2026 why?\nOf course, the brands will turn to the over-used trope of \u2018community. \u2019 Nicky Bell, Meta\u2019s vice president of creative shop, has already put it forward for the Wendyverse, saying, \u201cbuilding this world is a great example of how brands can show up in Horizon Worlds in intentional, meaningful ways with their communities.\u201d\nBut step back and ask yourself, what\u2019s meaningful about it?\nIt\u2019s still the same basic Nintendo Wii floating avatar, interacting with a bland-looking landscape filled with things that offer little aside from a brief moment of \u201chuh, cool.\u201d More so, who want\u2019s to be part of a Wendy\u2019s community? It\u2019s not like it\u2019s cool trainers, or high-end brands, or a social statement: it\u2019s a fast-food chain. It\u2019s falling into the same trap most of Meta\u2019s Horizon World concepts have so far: it fails to demonstrate why it\u2019s necessary, what benefit it offers users and that it\u2019s not just another project designed to suck up every last data point from those inside it.\nI\u2019d rather spend my time in a real Wendy\u2019s \u2014 and that\u2019s saying something.\nIf you want to read more of my work, or the work of the many, many great writers on this platform, consider becoming a member.

Streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music offer millions of songs just a click away. They\u2019re doing what mix tapes used to do \u2014 introducing us to new music. But algorithms will never know us the way our friends do.\nMix tapes are not just a compilation of music but a baring of the soul. Done properly, a mix tape is like writing poetry. It reveals your deepest longings and vulnerabilities, the soft spots inside your heart. A mix tape is an MRI of your unconscious. It\u2019s a portrait of who you are and how you view the world. It\u2019s a way to connect with someone and communicate deep feelings through music.\nCreating a mix tape takes hours of sweat and toil. You pore over each song compiling the perfect balance of melody, rhythm and lyrical content. A well-crafted mix tape steers clear of the obvious. If including a Jeff Buckley song, skip \u201cHallelujah\u201d for something more obscure like \u201cSatisfied Mind.\u201d If opting for Dylan, forgo his early catalogue and choose a later gem like \u201cNot Dark Yet.\u201d\nI\u2019ve been making mix tapes all my life. As a teenager, I transferred vinyl to cassette. I sat on my floor surrounded by album covers, painstakingly studying each song until I found the perfect cut. Every mix tape had a title reflecting a specific theme. I played the tape over and over as I progressed, making sure each song flowed into the next toward an emotional crescendo.\nI learned there are basic rules for making mix tapes. You need to identify your intention. Most of my early mix tapes were an attempt to win a woman\u2019s heart. Authenticity matters. Instead of settling for a love song like \u201cWhen a Man Loves a Woman\u201d go for something more beguiling like the Yeah Yeah Yeahs \u201cMaps\u201d or \u201cThis Must Be the Place\u201d by Talking Heads.\nAvoid plagiarizing the love expressions of others. The film Ghost used the Righteous Brothers song \u201cUnchained Melody\u201d to express the love between Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore. This makes the song off limits as mix tape fodder. The same goes for movie love songs like \u201cShallow\u201d (A Star is Born) and \u201cFalling Slowly\u201d (Once).\nA mix tape should start strong and end strong. Like a relay race, you want to burst out of the gate with a compelling tune like \u201cTeardrop\u201d by Massive Attack. The mix should be an emotional journey with ups and downs, twists and turns. Spirited highs should blend with moments of contemplation. Select songs the listener has never heard to avoid associative baggage. The final song should leave the listener breathless like \u201cHow It Ends\u201d by Devotchka.\nAlternative songs are great but should be used with caution. I\u2019m a huge fan of Neutral Milk Hotel but a song like \u201cTwo-Headed Boy\u201d might scare someone away. If you include a songwriting depressive like Elliott Smith, go for an optimistic tune like \u201cHappiness.\u201d The Magnetic Fields\u2019 \u201cBook of Love\u201d is beautiful but Stephin Merritt\u2019s voice is bleak. Opt for a cover version like that sung by Robin Pecknold (of Fleet Foxes).\nAll good mix tapes include a meld of different genres, eras and languages. French is the most romantic language so love mix tapes should include something by Edith Piaf or Francoise Hardy. Choose at least one instrumental piece (early Brian Eno is great). Songs should reflect your personal taste. If you\u2019re not into hip hop, don\u2019t include hip hop. Avoid punk rock, death rock, opera and yodeling. Classical cuts are great but often don\u2019t mix well with rock. Keep away from songs that use the theremin; they sound too much like a horror film.\nMaking a mix tape as a means of seduction is enthralling. Songs should express your sentimental side and show that you\u2019re a true romantic. Demonstrate your empathy with a song like \u201cLean On Me\u201d by Bill Withers. If your worldview is cynical be sure to show a hint of optimism with a song like \u201cWonderful\u201d by My Morning Jacket.\nMaking a mix tape to save a troubled relationship is more challenging since the person knows you well and can smell your bullshit. Be earnest but don\u2019t be maudlin. \u201cAin\u2019t Too Proud To Beg\u201d reeks of desperation. Go softer with something like \u201cLet\u2019s Stay Together\u201d by Al Green. Express how much you miss someone by including songs that evoke shared memories. Emphasize your commitment to the relationship with a song like \u201c2 Atoms in a Molecule\u201d by Noah and the Whale. If you did something wrong, choose a song that says you\u2019re sorry. If you really screwed up, spread apology songs throughout the mix.\nIf you need a secret weapon song to win someone back, try something by Snow Patrol. Or you might use \u201cThrow Your Arms Around Me\u201d by Hunters & Collectors or \u201cI Will Follow You Into the Dark\u201d by Death Cab For Cutie. Coldplay\u2019s \u201cFix You\u201d is an oft-chosen remedy for wounded relationships. Be wary here since the song is an anthem for dysfunction.\nThe worst mix tape is one you make after you\u2019ve been dumped. In some ways it\u2019s liberating since you have nothing to lose. This is the time to air grievances and expletives in the guise of music. Your ex doesn\u2019t have to listen so use discretion. In most cases a person will succumb to curiosity and play the tape if only to affirm how much power they have over your feelings.\nA good \u201cI\u2019ve been dumped\u201d mix tape incorporates guilt and anger. For guilt, try something like \u201cTerrible Love\u201d by the National. For anger, include \u201cSabotage\u201d by the Beastie Boys or something by the Violent Femmes. If you\u2019re really pissed, go for CeeLo Green\u2019s \u201cF- -k you\u201d though this scorched-earth tactic will obliterate any chance at reconciliation. Dark humor is preferable as expressed by Pearl Bailey in \u201cI Need You Like I Need a Hole in the Head.\u201d\nAfter a breakup, it\u2019s wise to make a mix tape for yourself. Include songs that express your inner pain. After a brutal breakup in my 20s, I made a mix tape I called \u201cSplitsville\u201d that included \u201cDon\u2019t Give Up\u201d by Peter Gabriel and \u201cHow Can You Mend a Broken Heart\u201d by the Bee Gees (corny but effective). Another song was \u201cWhy\u201d by Annie Lennox because she sang the words, \u201cHow many times do I have to tell you I\u2019m sorry for the things I\u2019ve done?\u201d This allowed me to scream, \u201cOnce, just tell me once.\u201d\nWhen I started dating again, I was reminded that mix tapes function as a compatibility tool. They help you determine if you\u2019re with the right person. If you\u2019re into Velvet Underground and your partner is listening to Dave Matthews, the relationship is doomed. One woman made me a Best of Jimmy Buffett mix tape. Needless to say, we never dated again.\nWhen I met the woman who would become my wife, we made mix tapes for each other. I\u2019ll never forget the first tape she gave me. It included artists I loved like the Pixies, This Mortal Coil and Nick Cave. It also included musicians I wasn\u2019t familiar with like PJ Harvey and Low. She threw in an Ella Fitzgerald/Louis Armstrong classic and a song from the film The Moderns, one of my favorite soundtracks. By the time the 90-minute mix was over, I knew she was the woman for me.\nThe most important mix tape you\u2019ll ever make is a mix for someone who is dying. I recently had this honor. My mom was in hospice and only had a few weeks to live. I visited her as much as possible. Knowing she spent her mornings and nights alone, I made her a mix tape.\nI began with \u201cSomewhere Over the Rainbow\u201d by Israel Kamakawiwo\u02bbole followed by Louis Armstrong\u2019s \u201cWhat a Wonderful World.\u201d My mom was a big Barbra Streisand fan so I included \u201cMemories.\u201d I added Judy Garland\u2019s \u201cYou\u2019ll Never Walk Alone\u201d and \u201cLullabye\u201d by Billy Joel.\nEvery night when I said goodbye to my mom in her hospital bed, I cued the CD player to play the mix on repeat all night long. I hope I didn\u2019t drive her crazy. I like to think the songs helped prepare her for her final journey. The final song was \u201cIn the Arms of an Angel\u201d by Sarah McLachlan. It was a reminder to my mom to make herself \u201cempty and weightless\u201d as she prepared to \u201cfly away from here.\u201d The song culminated in the lyrics:\nYou\u2019re in the arms of an angel. May you find some comfort here.\nThis was the last mix tape I ever made. I pray it brought my mom some peace.", "comment_count": 13, "like_count": 738, "created_time": 1646151051245, "comment": [{"user_id": "8df2a9e051d7", "comment_time": 1646151051245, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "1da081275a93", "comment_time": 1646924019885, "comment": "Mixtapes were such a labor of love, particularly back when recording from vinyl to cassette was the standard practice.

I hadn\u2019t been to Disneyland in years but I wasn\u2019t interested. I don\u2019t like crowds, tourist traps or long lines. We were also in the midst of a brutal heat wave. But my wife wanted to go so I agreed.\nWe met my sister and nephews in the parking lot at 9:00 am. The place was already a zoo. When the tram arrived to take us to the front gate there was only one row of seats left. A sunburned bald guy cut in front of us and directed his wife and two young boys to steal our spot.\n\u201cDude, those are our seats,\u201d I yelled.\n\u201cGo fuck yourself,\u201d he yelled back. I let loose with a torrent of obscenities and then noticed his boys staring at me in horror. My nephews were also alarmed. I apologized and did some deep breathing to calm my nerves. At the front gate a sign read: \u201cWelcome to the Happiest Place on Earth.\u201d We strolled into Main Street, Disney\u2019s version of 1950s-era small town America minus the lynchings. The ragtime music and cotton candy smells only increased my grouchiness. The first theme character we encountered was Eeyore from Winnie-the-Pooh. \u201cLook at that ass,\u201d I whispered to my wife. \u201cBehave,\u201d she said. \u201cYour nephews are here to have fun.\u201d\nMy nephews Tony and Dre wanted to hit all the exciting rides. First on their list was Space Mountain. A sign at the back of the line read \u201cWait Time 90 minutes.\u201d I regaled my nephews with stories of Disneyland deaths. \u201cTwo people died on the Matterhorn, one guy died on Thunder Mountain Railroad, a lady died on Space Mountain and a 16-year old boy was crushed by the People Mover.\u201d \u201cCool,\u201d my nephews said. My sister shot me an angry look.\nAfter Space Mountain, we went for Mexican food in Frontierland. My wife ordered beef tacos but I didn\u2019t trust Disneyland meat. I opted for a bean burrito, a huge mistake. As soon as we boarded the Pirates of the Caribbean my stomach started churning. I survived the waterfall drop and cannonball battle but when we hit the burning Spanish fort, I spewed my lunch into the faux Caribbean lagoon.\nNext came the Haunted Mansion. I told my nephews I\u2019d sit that one out but they wouldn\u2019t have it. \u201cCome on Uncle, this is a great ride.\u201d They waited in line while I hit a candy shop to see if they sold Pepto Bismol. Sure enough they had all kinds of OTC medicines beneath the counter. I purchased a shot-glass bottle of Pepto for $6.00 then joined my family for the 75-minute wait.\nMy nephews and I discussed the cosmology of ghosts. Tony decided ghosts took on the appearance of the age they were when they died. Dre believed they resembled how they looked when they were most alive. I contemplated why ghosts wore clothes (\u201cshouldn\u2019t they be naked\u201d). My wife wondered if ghosts reunited with the spirits of their dead pets.\nThe temperature soon hit 100-degrees. That\u2019s when I sensed a migraine aura. It was a series of visual sparks and blurriness preceding the onset of a major headache. I swallowed two aspirin but I knew I was screwed. Tony and Dre headed toward the Matterhorn. I wanted to sleep in a dark cave on Tom Sawyer\u2019s Island.\nSomewhere between Main Street and Sleeping Beauty\u2019s Castle, he appeared. His teeth were as sharp as daggers and his lips seemed to be smeared with blood. I\u2019d spent my entire childhood fearing him. Suddenly the Big Bad Wolf was heading directly towards me.\n\u201cShit,\u201d I said.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong,\u201d my wife asked.\n\u201cHim,\u201d I said pointing to the oncoming beast in his green pants, red suspenders and blue top hat. He looked absurd but I was terrified.\n\u201cLet\u2019s go the other way,\u201d I said to my nephews.\n\u201cThe Matterhorn is that way,\u201d Tony protested.\n\u201cI\u2019ll buy you some fudge.\u201d\n\u201cWe can get fudge later.\u201d\nTony grabbed my hand and pulled me into the wolf\u2019s path. I closed my eyes and grimaced, brushing against the creature\u2019s shoulder. When I opened my eyes he was gone. Was this a pre-migraine hallucination?\nWe got in line for the Matterhorn (70 minute wait). I\u2019d become hyper sensitive to smells, a sign the migraine was nearly upon me. A bearded guy in an Old Milwaukee hat reeked of garlic. His aging wife smelled of cheese. I was a basset hound in a landfill, overwhelmed by unrelenting stink. My only chance to fend off the migraine was to lie on a bag of ice in a darkened room. I apologized to my nephews and went in search of a Disney medical facility.\nGoofy directed me to a First Aid Center in Main Street. The vision in my left eye was flickering like an old-time zoetrope. I donned sunglasses and entered the clinic. A nurse led me to a room with eight cots. Six of them held poor bastards like me. One guy was vomiting into a bucket. Another had his head in his hands and was moaning. I requested water, aspirin and a bag of ice. I texted my location to my wife then lay down on a flimsy pillow.\nThe room was spinning. I closed my eyes and focused on the ice beneath my neck. If I could summon sleep then the migraine might go away. A twenty-something Hispanic on a nearby cot foiled these plans. He had bandages on his face and bloody cotton in his nostrils. He was on his phone talking about being cold-cocked by some \u201cpunk ass bitch\u201d in Toontown.\nThe sounds around me were cacophonous. I stuffed my ears with crumpled Kleenex to no avail.The teenager to my right mumbled incoherently and gesticulated madly as if speaking to an invisible person. He resembled someone escaped from a lunatic asylum.\n\u201cYou okay,\u201d I asked.\nHe turned towards me, his pupils dilated, his eyes shifting back and forth.\n\u201cI took acid in Critter Country. I saw some things.\u201d\n\u201cWhat things?\u201d\nHe whispered, \u201cThey\u2019re sacrificing kids.\u201d\n\u201cWho is?\u201d\n\u201cThem.\u201d He pointed to an animated wall poster of Donald Duck\u2019s family tree.\n\u201cDonald Duck is killing kids?\u201d\n\u201cShhh,\u201d he said.\nI moved to a different cot. Sleep was out of the question. I texted my wife: \u201cCan u come get me?\u201d\n\u201cU ok,\u201d she replied.\n\u201cNo. I want to go home.\u201d\n\u201cBut your nephews.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\nFifteen minutes later, my wife found me inside the clinic. A nurse checked my pulse then released me. My nephews were waiting outside to make sure I was okay. I gave them a big hug and promised to take them to a Dodgers game soon. Dre handed me a Disney gift bag. Inside was a brick of chocolate fudge.\nMy wife and I boarded a tram to the parking lot. When we finally located our car, we noticed the back left tire was flat due to a conspicuous nail in the tread. I felt like crying. We waited 45 minutes for Auto Club to tow us to a repair garage outside Disneyland. There was a line of five drivers with flat tires due to suspicious nails. Each had been at Disneyland. We all agreed this was some sort of scam perpetrated by the repair shop but we just wanted to get out of there.\nFreeway traffic was horrid. When we finally made it home, I filled a bag of ice and leaped into bed.

I\u2019d drive to the studio on Monday morning where I was given 5 to 10 screenplays to read, synopsize and critique by Friday afternoon. Most scripts were awful. There were so many retreads of Lethal Weapon and Beverly Hills Cop I began to hate reading screenplays (including my own).\nOne week I encountered a screenplay that was amazing and bizarre. It was called One Saliva Bubble. The screenwriters were Mark Frost and David Lynch. Yes, that David Lynch, the director responsible for some of my favorite movies: Eraserhead, Elephant Man, Blue Velvet.\nI was confused. Why did one of the era\u2019s great American auteurs have to suffer the indignity of a low-level script reading? Why would studio heads leave it to a minion like me to influence whether or not another Lynch movie was made?\nI sat down at my local coffee house and read the script. By the middle of page one, I was smiling. By page 10, I was laughing hysterically. When I finished the script I was in love with screenwriting again. The story had a slapstick feel, a Coen Brothers rhythm with the silliness of Monty Python.\nThe script begins when a single saliva bubble floats from the mouth of a laughing security guard onto exposed copper wire inside a Pentagon control center. This causes an electrical short activating a space satellite. An ominous countdown begins. We meet the offbeat citizens of Newtonville, Kansas. They include a Swiss scientist, an assassin, Chinese acrobats, attendees at a Heinz 57 convention and the \u201cworld\u2019s stupidest man.\u201d When the satellite ticks to zero, it emits a laser burst that strikes Newtonville causing the characters to change personalities (and clothes). The assassin becomes the car salesman, the scientist becomes the village idiot, a black jazz musician becomes a white floozy and so on. Strangely, no one notices the personality changes except the Pentagon Generals who try in vain to fix the problem.\nLynch called the script an \u201cout and out wacko dumb comedy.\u201d He attempted to make the film with Steve Martin and Martin Short but couldn\u2019t obtain financing. Lynch and Frost abandoned the project and went on to write and produce Twin Peaks.\nI made a copy of One Saliva Bubble and passed it among my screenwriter friends. I learned of another dormant Lynch screenplay with mythic status. It was called Ronnie Rocket. I knew someone at Propaganda Pictures who represented Lynch at the time. My friend smuggled me the script (after promises of free margaritas) and I immersed myself in another Lynchian universe.\nRonnie Rocket is difficult to synopsize. Lynch himself said the film is \u201can American smokestack industrial thing. It has to do with coal, oil and electricity\u2026 and a three-foot guy with red hair.\u201d\nThe story takes place in a post-apocalyptic city (similar to Eraserhead) plagued by electrical mayhem involving a mercurial, demon-like figure named Hank Bartells. Bartells alters the city\u2019s electrical grid and sends black-coated \u201cDonut Men\u201d to assault people with cattle prods. The resulting upheaval causes people to pulsate, have seizures, eat their hands and have hemorrhages.\nEnter the protagonist, the midget Ronnie Rocket. Ronnie tries to solve the city\u2019s problems when he\u2019s kidnapped by two mad scientists who recreate him in their lab with bright red hair and a body pulsing with electrical current. The resurrected Ronnie must plug himself into the wall every 15 minutes to rejuvenate. Ronnie joins a rock band and becomes a teen idol, but the evil Bartells electrocutes Ronnie every time he performs causing his life essence to slip away.\nIn some ways Ronnie Rocket is a dramatic version of One Saliva Bubble. Both rely on interruptions to an electrical grid that wreaks havoc on the status quo. It\u2019s the dark tone that makes Ronnie Rocket unforgettable. At one point the \u201cDonut Men\u201d burst into flames upon being told their shoes are untied (a broken circuit). The mad scientists celebrate their reanimation of Ronnie by going out for milkshakes.\nLike many of Lynch\u2019s movies, Ronnie Rocket explores themes of idealized 50s culture, industrial design and physical deformity. Lynch began writing the script in 1978. For the next two decades, he attempted to get the movie made.\nPotential backers included Dino De Laurentis Entertainment (they went bankrupt) and Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s American Zoetrope (they also went bankrupt). Studios and financiers had a hard time getting their heads around the film. Lynch said, \u201cIt\u2019s not really a violent film. But it\u2019s completely abstract, like Eraserhead. I need to work with people who are not looking for a tremendous commercial return.\u201d\nLynch stopped actively pursuing Ronnie Rocket in 1990 but never officially abandoned the project. The indie filmmaker Jonathan Caouette (Tarnation) expressed interest in reviving the project but he still believes Lynch will make it someday.\nOther unmade Lynch projects include a film version of Kafka\u2019s Metamorphosis, a script about Marilyn Monroe called Venus Descending, a story called Dream of the Bovine about three guys who used to be cows and Antelope Don\u2019t Run No More about space aliens, talking animals and a struggling rock and roller named Pinky. Most of these screenplays can be found online.

She asks for it all the time, for everything.\nSometimes I want to reply, \u201cYou\u2019re my girlfriend and I give you blanket consent for all things!\u201d Because that feels true. But then I think about how, when I really stop and think about it, it feels good to know that I can always say \u201cno\u201d or \u201cnot right now\u201d or \u201cI feel like I can\u2019t because.\u201d (I think that it\u2019s fine to say \u201cno\u201d full stop; but it\u2019s also fine to want to connect by explaining a \u201cno.\u201d Both of those kinds of no\u2019s are appropriate depending on the question and the relationship and what feels good in your body. See the bottom of this post for a small tangent on how to say \u201cno.\u201d)\nAs a result, our relationship feels safe, so I also ask Kat most of my embarrassing ethical questions that I don\u2019t want anyone to know I\u2019m wondering about. (First I ask her if I can ask her \ud83d\ude0a.) Having a culture of consent has made way for an incredibly secure relationship that ends up having FEWER necessary boundaries because the ones that exist are so clear.\nThere\u2019s no shortage of things about which it\u2019s appropriate to ask for consent.\n\nThere are nine million more examples. I counted.\n\nIt is an incredible gift we can give to the people we love to remind them of how valued they are.\n\nAs adrienne maree brown says, \u201cNo makes way for yes.\u201d\nMy partner Bob is really, really good at hearing no. I am not good at this. I don\u2019t know how to hear no. He has practiced a lot and is a master at it. The first time I ever told him no, I was terrified. He responded, \u201cThank you for saying no! I\u2019m proud of you!\u201d And I was like, \u201cWhoa. Whooooa. We can do that? We can say no? We can be ok with people saying no? We can be HAPPY people have said no to us!? I didn\u2019t know this was a way relationships could be.\u201d Being able to say no and hear no with Bob has made room for more yesses inside our relationship. I actually am shocked at how true this is. It feels like a weird magic.\nMy sister Alexis taught me this one: Rather than asking, \u201cWhy do you feel that way?\u201d She asks, \u201cWould you be open to sharing more about what you\u2019re feeling?\u201d It is a little adjustment that makes a big difference.\nThe explicitness and frequency of questions of consent is the single greatest thing I can point to that has elevated relationships to partnership status throughout my life. (For clarification, I have a lot of people I consider partners. I am frustrated that language hasn\u2019t adapted for the not-just-friends-not-lovers category. \u201cPartner\u201d feels like the closest proximity but still not quite right.) I\u2019m absolutely a novice at asking for, giving, and receiving consent, and \u201cno\u201d is even trickier.\nTo that end, here\u2019s a little tangent on my no-saying philosophy.

It\u2019s SO MUCH STUFF.\nIllustration by the author.\nHow do you feel about pigeons? There are only three correct answers to this:\nI LOVE THEM. I AM OBSESSED WITH THEM. PIGEONS ARE TREMENDOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nLook, I\u2019m not that in to pigeons, but I have respect for them.\nI don\u2019t know how I feel about them, Sophie. That\u2019s why I am here, reading this article.\nIf you are already in the first category, I imagine I\u2019m not going to say anything you don\u2019t already know. You probably have already read this important piece by Michelle T\u00e9a, and maybe you\u2019ve already read this also-important comic that I made last year. Maybe you\u2019re just here to have a downloadable PDF of this \u201cThings Pigeons Can Do\u201d poster. There it is. You can go now.\nIf you fall under categories two or three, or a fourth, unspoken anti-pigeon category, gather \u2018round. Let me tell you a little bit about pigeons.\nPigeons can do a lot of human hang-out things.\nIt\u2019s not like pigeons have to do human things, but they\u2019ve historically been way nicer to us than we deserve. Humans have taught pigeons to play ping-pong, to race each other for sport, and become loyal friend that will return to your human self if you are willing and able to show them you care about them. This is really incredible, whereas humans are pigeons\u2019 greatest predators. Frankly, we\u2019re horrible to them, and they keep showing up for us.\nPigeons have fought in wars and saved lives.\nThe most famous war pigeon was Cher Ami, a male homing pigeon who delivered a critical message from an encircled battalion in World War I, even though he was seriously injured. (Yes, he did win a purple heart.) Because pigeons are so intelligent and loyal, many of them were trained as spies and messengers in early wars.\nThey continue to save human lives into the twenty-first century. Pigeons (who are fast, can fly, and have great eyesight) have been trained to to look for red or yellow life jackets in order to find people who have been lost at sea. And since they can perceive ultraviolet light surrounding a person in the water (!!!!!), there are experts who attest that pigeons are actually better than humans at making sea rescues.\nThere are 351 species of pigeons, and some of them are so beautiful your jaw is going to drop.\nMy personal favorite is the Victoria Crowned Pigeon, who is AS BIG AS A TURKEY and looks like it is going to the fanciest ball. I\u2019ve seen one IRL at the Brookfield Zoo (and yes, I went to this zoo FOR THE SOLE REASON that I heard that they had this kind of pigeon), but it kind of broke my heart. This pigeon is too beautiful to be in a zoo. All pigeons are too beautiful to be in a zoo. All animals are too beautiful to be in a zoo. OK, moving on.\n\nPigeons used to carry our mail, and they still can.\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard of messenger pigeons (and if you haven\u2019t, um, Google it), but you might not know the extent to which pigeons can reliably text for you. Pigeons have been used to send messages at least as far back as the 5th century AD, and can carry up to 10 percent of their body weight. Pigeons used to carry the results of the Olympics to people who were sports-obsessed in a pre-mass-communication past.\nThe last official pigeon post didn\u2019t close until 2004 (it was in India!), and some people still use pigeons to send messages.\nPigeons are great at science, math, and analysis.\nIt would take a whole book (and there are several) to properly dive into every STEM-y thing that pigeons can do, so here is a PARTIAL bullet-point list:\nThey can do basic math.\nThey can be taught complex actions and response sequences.\nThey can tell the difference between an impressionist and an abstract expressionist painting.\nThey can identify cancer cells better on average than cancer doctors.\nThey can tell the difference between other individual pigeons, and between individual humans.\nThey can recognize themselves in the mirror.\nThey can make models.\nThey can remember hundreds of individual images for years at a time.\nI once personally watched a pigeon place a plastic water bottle over a plastic spike under an overpass that had been designed to deter pigeons, and then the pigeon sat on top of the water bottle and ultimately built a nest behind it and raised its babies behind it.\nPigeons have literally mystical homing abilities.\nReady for this? Pigeons can find their way back to their own nests from 1,300 miles away. That would be like if someone plopped you down in Havana and told you to find your way back to your house in Chicago.\nBut that\u2019s not all: pigeons can do this even if they\u2019ve been flown to Havana in an airplane, while concealed in a black box where sight, sound, and smell are completely absent. You might know that birds know what direction north is because of a magnet in their brains, but \u201cnorth\u201d is not going to get you to Chicago. You\u2019d need sight markers or smell markers or something like that in order to get from Havana to Chicago. In human terms, this would be like if you had only ever hung out at YOUR HOUSE for your WHOLE LIFE, and then someone put you in an airplane where you were unable to see, hear, or smell anything, and flew you to Havana, and gave you a compass, and told you to find your way back to YOUR HOUSE.\nSo, yeah. Human scientists don\u2019t know how pigeons can do this. They really don\u2019t.\nPigeons aren\u2019t actually dirty.\nMaybe you\u2019ve heard that pigeons are dirty. That\u2019s false. HUMANS are dirty, and pigeons are able to make use of some of our refuse to help them to survive. In fact, pigeons are incredibly clean and there is no research suggesting that they spread disease.\nFurthermore, pigeon poop (or, if you want to get sexy about it, \u201cguano\u201d) was once quite valuable, as it acts as terrific crop fertilizer. In fact, people used to employ guards to watch over dovecotes (that\u2019s a pigeon house humans used to make in order to \u201ckeep\u201d pigeons, and you should read about them) so people wouldn\u2019t come and STEAL THE PIGEON POOP.\nPigeons model loving relationships that make human love look like a first draft.\nPigeons mate for life and live in complex communities of multiple families, like little pigeon communes that could teach us humans a thing or two about how to get along.\nIn terms of what I mean about \u201clove,\u201d here are the last few panels from a comic I made for The Believer that explains it.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s more.\nIf you can believe it, this is just a scratching of the surface when it comes to pigeon miracles. A simple Google Search for \u201cThings pigeons can do\u201d yields thousands (!!!) of articles like this one with even more bullet points for you.\nIf you\u2019re unconvinced, I feel like you didn\u2019t read this article. Go back and read it again.\nAnd if you\u2019re STILL not convinced, let me ask you this: what can YOUR species do that\u2019s so great? Oh! Y\u2019all invented war, nuclear weapons, xenophobia, and global climate change? Cool. Cool.\n(PS \u2014 I am a human and not a pigeon, and so I do love humans, too. But I don\u2019t stan humans who don\u2019t love pigeons.)\n(PPS \u2014 I made a shirt of this! Buy one!)\n", "comment_count": 11, "like_count": 677, "created_time": 1643147387731, "comment": [{"user_id": "232429a9ed7f", "comment_time": 1643147387731, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "34dc59292e02", "comment_time": 1648934197422, "comment": "Yes.

I decided to go with it, ultimately, because I felt that typing at the gym (1) isn\u2019t technically against the rules; (2) is absolutely not hurting anyone; and (3) would probably make a good story for someone stopping by the High Ridge YMCA on a whim.\n\u201cWife Jenny, guess what I saw the gym today, you\u2019ll never guess.\u201d\n\u201cWife Kate, give me a chance to guess, please. Don\u2019t assume I will never guess.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re right. Go ahead and guess.\u201d\n\u201cWas it a person with a dog or a ferret?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cA baby on a treadmill?\u201d\n\u201cNo no no; it was some hipster trash glasses-wearing tattoo-having chick who was TYPING on WHAT APPEARED TO BE A TYPEWRITER FROM THE NINETIES while she was ON. THE. TREADMILL.\u201d\n\u201cYou should have let me keep guessing! That was my next guess!\u201d\nThe scene I\u2019ve painted above is a lively argument between wives, but at least it got the wives talking, right? The spark might be mostly out of the marriage, but now they\u2019re talking about the person who brought a TYPEWRITER to the gym.\nThis is not my first time with a typewriter at the gym, and I am not using an actual typewriter. Let\u2019s cover the latter detail first, because surely you\u2019re thinking, \u201cWhat do you mean you have a TYPEWRITER at the gym? What does this device even possibly LOOK LIKE?\u201d\nThis device is called the Alphasmart NEO, and they don\u2019t make them anymore, but they\u2019re readily available on Amazon\u2019s used section or eBay for close to $60. (When I bought mine, it was $20. But, alas, inflation.) A hipster startup called FreeWrite is making a version of this machine right now and is marketing it to exactly the kind cactus-owning, hemp protein-buying, beanie-wearing cliche that I seem to be. This device, which has turned up in my Instagram ad feed, costs $200, and is quite bulky. The idea behind it is that we Millennials can\u2019t really trust ourselves around the internet (fair), and we need a word processor that is old-fashioned enough to be COMPLETELY distraction-free. Someone had this idea in the early 2000s, but we weren\u2019t scared of our smart phones enough yet, so it didn\u2019t take off. Now the remnants of that failed business endeavor are readily available on the internet (I do see the irony in that), and man oh man do I ever recommend buying one.\nThe Alphasmart Neo is a comfy computer keyboard with a one-inch screen that allows you type, spell check, and transfer to your computer big text files. It\u2019s that gray-green color that was very popular in the early days of computers, and the text that comes up on the little screen is pretty big \u2014 I\u2019ve just taken a picture of it for you so you can see what I\u2019m looking at. (I\u2019m on the treadmill actively moving around, so I\u2019m not really sure if the picture will turn out, but that kind of makes this whole reading experience more \u201clive\u201d and \u201creal,\u201d doesn\u2019t it?)\n\nThe most immediately wonderful thing about typing on the Alphasmart NEO is how satisfying it is to compose something. You can only see four lines at a time, so there\u2019s no impetus to scroll back and edit yourself and delete things; you are sort of forced to charge forward with your writing. Because the text on the screen is so gigantic, it feels like you\u2019re writing A LOT of words; like while you walk for a mile on this treadmill, you have simultaneously penned the Great American Novel (and hey \u2014 maybe you have!). The Alphasmart NEO doesn\u2019t suggest to you that you might be writing a letter; it doesn\u2019t scribble underneath your misuse of \u201ctheir\u201d with a blue line; it doesn\u2019t ping at you when your girlfriend texts you a cool picture of a fuzzy dog. All the Alphasmart NEO wants is for you to Keep. Writing. And for most writers, that\u2019s a tough thing to do.\nI teach writing at a high school, and I sort of wish that I could make my students sit in a room for an hour a day with no internet and nothing but the Alphasmart NEO. Yesterday I met with eight students, and all eight of them bemoaned that they \u201cjust didn\u2019t know how to keep going\u201d; they\u2019d \u201clost the spark with this piece.\u201d I know that feeling really well; I know from experience that this is a particularly damaging lie our brains tell us in order to prevent us from doing the very courageous work of continuing to write. Distractions are only one element of this hindrance; the other is that the longer you work on something, the scarier it is to try to finish it. Because what if it isn\u2019t very good? So far, it\u2019s not as good as you pictured it being. Wouldn\u2019t it be better to just stop now and start something else that, surely, will be better?\nThis is where I wish that the students could walk on a treadmill and write FORWARD, into the weird, \u201890s-looking oblivion of the Alphasmart NEO. I swear by this machine so much that it\u2019s currently the only way I\u2019m really able to write.\nMy gym habit is at a peak. I love this about my life; it makes me exponentially more OK day to day. This isn\u2019t in my imagination: every study around exercise that has ever been done since the beginning of time (I subscribe to 85 or so women\u2019s magazines, so I\u2019ve read them all) comes to the same conclusion: Exercise is ONLY GOOD FOR YOU. It can solve pretty much EVERY PROBLEM YOU HAVE. It can and will keep you from getting depressed. It can and will keep you from getting a cold. It can and will keep you from feeling like you\u2019re a failure as a woman because you never get up off your ass to attempt to make yourself thinner and younger-looking and more beautiful.*\nI never went to the gym before we moved to Rogers Park, by the way. I really love the High Ridge YMCA.** In contrast to our former YMCA, the Lakeview Y (where Luke still works, so no shade), there are, on average, zero ultrafit 30-something moms sprinting on treadmills or trying to jump on blocks here. It seems like adult special education programs come here a lot. There are whole families that show up to do the jump rope, but their bodies are not Traditional Western Hot, and that is so obviously not the point for them. There are a lot of folks who are older than my parents and who walk on the treadmill or lightly pedal the stationary bikes. There is one muscle dude who is always here, and he has a funny ponytail, and even HE seems a little bit like an exercise outcast. Right now, six of the eight treadmills are being used, and not a single person is running. This feels like a YMCA for people who like to move around because it\u2019s good for them, not because they want their Lululemon influencer cred.\nI am including these details (and who knows, it\u2019s possible I\u2019ll edit them out after I upload it onto my computer, which is a pretty fun ordeal with the Alphasmart NEO***) to prove that I\u2019m not so sure that exercising is the point. A mile is a good amount of time to write. It\u2019s nice to be at a machine that doesn\u2019t tell me about anything in Real Time. I love this machine; I love how non-judgmental it is; I love how it encourages me to move forward. Physically, sure. Mentally, definitely. Forward, always.\n*I stopped writing this essay right here, because I\u2019d walked a mile, and it was time to do something else. Then I came back to it a week later, and I wrote this:\nI have returned to this essay after about a week. Let me take a moment to say that I\u2019m really not sure how I\u2019m supposed to feel about bodies and weight loss and weight gain and muscles and treadmills. Recently, the brilliant Julie Mitchell posted an excellent rant about how frustrated she is with intentional weight loss (I agree) and how she would like people to stop talking about holiday eating like it is a bad thing. Like a lot of women, I know roughly how many calories are in anything and everything that might come near my mouth, and I know how many I am \u201csupposed\u201d to eat to maintain or lose weight. Reading the paragraph above back to myself, I\u2019m struck by my insistence that exercise is fixing all my problems. It definitely isn\u2019t. One of the most irritating thought loops that pulses through my mind MORE THAN TEN TIMES PER DAY is, \u201cI should exercise. Am I doing it for the right reasons? What ARE the right reasons? Won\u2019t it make me feel better? Shape Magazine, to which I subscribe, says yes. But Shape is just trying to sell me stuff. I\u2019m a slave to capitalism. If I\u2019m being honest, am I going to the gym because it makes me FEEL better? Or is it because I want to look a certain way? Is it both? How can I know? Do I love my body? If I don\u2019t, WHAT\u2019S WRONG WITH ME? My body is so good to me. It\u2019s a wonderful body. I almost never get sick and I can lift boxes when people are moving. Is my d daily weigh-in habit symptomatic of disordered eating? Is it fucked up that I can only write on the treadmill? I\u2019m ungrateful. I\u2019m disgusting. I\u2019m super-privileged. This thought spiral has already gone on way too long. I\u2019m a disappointment to myself, to women everywhere, and to all the Greater Goods I try to align myself with. Oh well. I better go the gym anyway.\u201d\n** I wrote this essay in 2018, and The High Ridge YMCA has, heartbreakingly, closed. It didn\u2019t survive the pandemic.

I didn\u2019t want to know what not to do; I wanted to know what TO do. And I figured that this long list of stuff that isn\u2019t supposed to make anyone feel better is part of why so many people report that they often feel abandoned in their grief; in lieu of saying the potentially wrong thing, the people in a grieving person\u2019s life say nothing. Nothing!\nOver the years (and through my own experiences of grieving), I learned that \u201cI\u201d statements are most useful to me, and truthful ones (Like: \u201cI remember the person you lost. Here\u2019s a specific memory. That was so important to me. I feel sad they\u2019re gone.\u201d). But that\u2019s not what works for everyone, all of the time.\nThere is simply no one-size-fits-all turn-of-phrase to pull out when someone\u2019s distressed. There are a lot of things to try, and most of them aren\u2019t going to feel right in a given moment. Some problems call for problem-solving; others call for quiet and time and holding of discomfort. I\u2019ve now heard two therapists tell me that codependency isn\u2019t a terrible thing in and of itself; it becomes a problem in the way it manifests and how it\u2019s patterned. Are there times when a lie is the kinder thing? Are there times when the kinder thing isn\u2019t necessarily the right thing? Are there times when yelling is an antidote? I\u2019m venturing yes, yes, and yes.\nHere are seven ways you might respond to someone who\u2019s going through something hard. Consider not only offering some of these, but also asking for them.\nA note: for the starred images, make sure you get consent first. If someone is in the midst of grieving, they are likely not ready for reassurance. More often than not, someone who comes to you with a problem doesn\u2019t actually want you to fix it for them, they just want you to hear them. If you are in a healthy, trusting relationship with the person, you can say, \u201cWould you be open to some reassurance right now? Or would it be more helpful for me to validate you?\u201d\n\nThis is often my go-to, and I like to couple it with a quick recap of what the person has said to me. \u201cWow. You had to carry a heavy sofa all the way across town by yourself, and then it started to rain! Now it sounds like you\u2019re feeling frustrated and exhausted. That makes sense!\u201d Pro tip: The three words \u201cthat makes sense\u201d have saved MANY of my relationships, many times over.\n\nThis one gets a bad rap sometimes because people mistake connection for selfishness. You might think, \u201cI shouldn\u2019t talk about myself right now! She\u2019s telling me HER story!\u201d But this is probably the response I most often crave. It\u2019s how I feel less isolated, and more in conversation with the people you love. If you want to be safe, you can say, \u201cWow, yeah, that really resonates with me. Can I share a story that this is making me think of?\u201d\n\nA reader told me that this is also better with consent, as in, \u201cCan I repeat back for you what I heard?\u201d I would say to that reader that consent is pretty much ALWAYS better, but I liked his framing of that question. Reflection is a way of collaborating with someone on their problem. It\u2019s like when you look at someone else\u2019s living room and suggest a paint color. You\u2019re bringing your perspective to their unique situation.\n\nI basically never want to hear any of this, but some of the best conversations I\u2019ve had in my life have been grounded in this kind of challenge. The key is trusting the person you\u2019re talking with to be non-judgmental as you look at a situation more like scientists than therapists.\n\nFor all that I\u2019ve been told not to give advice, there are tons of times when advice is exactly the thing I want! My pleasure center lights up as soon as I hear someone say, \u201cMan, that IS a tough situation! Here\u2019s what I think I would do.\u201d Even if a deep part of me already has a solution, it feels good to imagine lots of different possibilities, and think about things from angles that are unfamiliar to me. Joint problem-solving is a great way to build connection, too. Just make sure you check in first to determine whether they\u2019re ready or wanting to engage with kinetic feedback.\n\nDuring my most recent meltdown, I realized in a flutter that I had no interest in being validated or connected to. I did not want someone to tell me my feelings made sense. I wanted them to be like, \u201cSophie! You\u2019re over-reacting! This is really not as big of a deal as you think it is. Don\u2019t worry; you\u2019re going to be OK. Actually, you\u2019re going to be great. Greatness is in your future, I can SEE IT.\u201d Even if the future greatness didn\u2019t turn out to come to fruition, I wanted to calm down and believe that it would, if only for a minute. This was when I learned to ask for reassurance from my loved ones. They\u2019re all such good friends that they didn\u2019t want to minimize my problem without my permission. Asking for reassurance ended up turning my whole day around.\n\nSometimes there isn\u2019t anything to say, but don\u2019t let that keep you from showing up. Crawl down to be with the person you love who is hurting, and assure them that you are there alongside them in their darkness.

Denmark\u2019s experience shows they don\u2019t need to be.\n\nThe U.S. may be one country, but when it comes to handling Covid, it has from the start been very much a collection of states, states that have responded to the pandemic in very different ways. (And even within states, there are often dramatic differences in the policies cities and towns have adopted.) And this remains very much the case.\nIn some parts of the country, after all, people are taking few, if any, precautions in the form of indoor masking or social distancing, even when case rates are high and the hospitals are filled with Covid patients. In other parts of the country \u2014 often, paradoxically, those with high vaccination rates, meaning people are better protected against infection and severe illness \u2014 people are still regularly wearing masks indoors, and restaurants and movie theaters are much less crowded than they were pre-pandemic.\nThe restrictions that blue states, in particular, still have in place are far less significant than the ones that existed before vaccines became widely available, with indoor masking being by far the most consequential. But vaccine skeptics and critics of any type of Covid-related restrictions often point to the fact that people in places with high rates of vaccination and relatively low case numbers \u2014 like Connecticut (where I live), Massachusetts, and Maryland \u2014 are still being required to wear masks or, in some places, use vaccine passports as evidence that Covid restrictions, once put in place, are permanent.\nIt doesn\u2019t matter how high vaccination rates get, this argument goes. If you put things like vaccine passports or indoor mask rules in place, public-health authorities will never let things get back to normal, because they\u2019re obsessed with controlling the population and trying to drive case numbers down to zero (something that most scientists believe is now unlikely to happen). Better, then, to just rip the band-aid off and get rid of all restrictions.\nNow, the most obvious objection to this argument is that public-health authorities already did let things get back to normal earlier this year, when, in May, the C.D.C. announced that vaccinated people no longer needed to wear masks in most indoor spaces. That announcement was followed, almost immediately, by states across the country lifting their mask mandates, and while the lifting of restrictions technically applied only to vaccinated people, in practice no one was required to wear masks. If Covid restrictions exist primarily so that regulators can assert their authority, then it\u2019s hard to explain why the C.D.C. lifted its mask mandate across the board, particularly given that it took a great deal of criticism from public-health experts for doing so.\nOf course, the C.D.C. put its mask recommendation for areas of substantial and high transmission back in place after just a couple of months, after it concluded that vaccinated people who had breakthrough cases of Covid could transmit the Delta variant relatively easily. I\u2019ve been critical of the C.D.C.\u2019s messaging around this, which I think has made vaccinated people more worried about the risk of being infected and transmitting the virus than the statistics justify, and in the process has contributed to skepticism about the vaccines\u2019 effectiveness. But the C.D.C.\u2019s decision was a clear response to what it perceived as new data and to the much greater contagiousness of the Delta variant. And given the extraordinary number of Covid cases, hospitalizations, and deaths that we\u2019ve seen over the past two months \u2014 the vast majority of them in states with low vax rates and almost no restrictions \u2014 it\u2019s hard to argue that doing nothing was really a sensible strategy.\nMore to the point, the fact that restrictions were put back in place in parts of the country does not mean that we need to be, or will be, stuck with them forever. First of all, there are high-vax states, like Vermont, that lifted all restrictions and have not re-imposed them, even as their case numbers have risen (thanks mainly to the unvaccinated). And blue states in general have not imposed statewide mandates, choosing instead to let cities and towns set their own policies, based on their case numbers. (Vaccine passports, meanwhile, are only in place in a few cities.) As I\u2019ll write about tomorrow, this is an imperfect system in practice, because cities typically use the C.D.C.\u2019s unrealistically strict standards to set policy. But in principle, the policy is by nature temporary: if the burden Covid is imposing shrinks, restrictions come off.\nThere\u2019s an excellent example of what this looks like in practice: Denmark.\nDenmark was one of the first countries to adopt a vaccine passport system, while requiring masks in certain situations and limiting the size of gatherings. But around three weeks ago, Denmark lifted all restrictions \u2014 including the vaccine passport system \u2014 because, with roughly 75% of its population vaccinated, and Covid hospitalizations and deaths at a very low level, the government concluded that Covid was no longer a \u201csocially critical\u201d disease. The country\u2019s Health Minister was explicit about the fact that Denmark was lifting all restrictions because they were meant to be emergency measures, and \u201cmust not be the new normal in society.\u201d Norway and, less surprisingly, Sweden have since followed suit.\nNow, Denmark may end up temporarily re-imposing certain restrictions at some point if it sees another big spike. But the point is that putting rules in place temporarily does not mean committing to living with them forever. Instead, countries can get back to normal even without eradicating Covid, as long as their populations are protected from its worst effects. You just need to get most people vaccinated to do it.", "comment_count": 15, "like_count": 1536, "created_time": 1633058030199, "comment": [{"user_id": "46f93ea1809", "comment_time": 1633058030199, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "671d7f7241fa", "comment_time": 1633141742397, "comment": "The difference between the culture and size of the giant asylum that is the US (with tens of millions subscribing to beliefs that are too absurd for words) and the culture and size of Denmark (with its 5.8 million people) can't be overstated.

Louisiana Just Said Yes.", "content": "Are Protest Organizers Responsible For Anything That Happens at a Protest? Louisiana Just Said Yes.\nDeRay Mckesson, 2016 (Aaron Muszalski)\nThere\u2019s lots of gnashing of teeth and beating of breasts these days over various threats to free speech. So it\u2019s a little perplexing that a recent decision by the Louisiana State Supreme Court that represents a remarkably blatant infringement on the 1st Amendment rights of demonstrators has gotten little notice.\nIn its decision, which was handed down last week, the court ruled that a lawsuit filed by a Baton Rouge police officer against Black Lives Matter organizer and activist DeRay McKesson could proceed. The officer who filed the suit claims he was seriously injured during the demonstrations that followed the killing of Alton Sterling by police officers in 2016. According to the suit, he was hit in the face with something (a rock, or concrete, or perhaps a water bottle) thrown by a demonstrator, and lost some teeth and suffered injuries to his jaw and brain.\nNow, the person who threw the rock was never identified (and therefore never arrested). So the police officer sued McKesson instead. (He also initially tried to sue Black Lives Matter, but that attempt was denied.) It\u2019s worth noting how conceptually odd this was. There\u2019s no allegation that McKesson, or any other organizer, told anyone to throw anything, or did anything to encourage violence. There\u2019s no evidence that McKesson knew anything was going to be thrown at the cops. He wasn\u2019t even there when the incident took place. In fact, he wasn\u2019t even one of the lead organizers of the demonstrations, although he did take part in a march that blocked a public highway (during which he was arrested).\nSo why was sued? Because he was a visible BLM organizer and because, the lawsuit alleges, he had been one of those who led the demonstrators onto the highway to commit an act of civil disobedience. (McKesson says he wasn\u2019t an organizer and didn\u2019t tell anyone to block the highway.) The plaintiff\u2019s argument is that McKesson should have anticipated that breaking the law by blocking the highway would lead the police would respond in force, and that demonstrators might in turn respond with violence. He was therefore responsible, the suit alleges, for whatever violence demonstrators committed after the act of civil disobedience.\nThis lawsuit has taken a circuitous route through the federal courts (where it was initially thrown out, then reinstated by an appeals court) up to the Supreme Court. It was then remanded to the Louisiana Supreme Court, which was asked to rule on whether Louisiana law \u2014 which says citizens can be held responsible if they \u201cnegligently precipitate the crime of a third party\u201d \u2014 permitted this lawsuit to go forward. And the court\u2019s decision that the lawsuit can go forward isn\u2019t the end of the line \u2014 the case should, ultimately, head back to the Supreme Court. But the fact that the court adopted such a broad definition of \u201cnegligently precipitate\u201d is nonetheless a troubling sign of the willingness to restrict the rights of protest and speech. McKesson\u2019s supposed \u201cnegligence\u201d here, after all, was in not anticipating that committing a nonviolent act of civil disobedience might lead someone else \u2014 someone he had no knowledge of or control over \u2014 to do something violent.\nThis is a very bad decision. It conflicts with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in NAACP vs. Claiborne Hardware Co., a case involving an aggressive boycott of white store owners in Clairborne County, Mississippi, a boycott that led, in some cases, to violence and threats of violence. The Court held unanimously in that case that unless a protest leader directly orders violence, the 1st Amendment protects them from being held responsible for violence that occurs as a result of the protest.\nMore substantively, if you can, in fact, hold protest organizers responsible for any violence that occurs at a demonstration that police respond to, it will make people incredibly leery of organizing acts of civil disobedience, since they will thereby become responsible for any act that a troublemaker or even an agent provocateur decides to commit after the civil disobedience begins. We already require protesters to risk arrest and jail time in order to exercise their 1st Amendment right to peaceably assemble. If McKesson were to lose this lawsuit, it would mean protest organizers could face financial ruin, too. That will have an obvious and profound chilling effect on future protests. And that, of course, is the point.", "comment_count": 7, "like_count": 21, "created_time": 1648784893508, "comment": [{"user_id": "46f93ea1809", "comment_time": 1648784893508, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "e1e4011d7bee", "comment_time": 1648936537411, "comment": "Sharing this with my audience, as it does need to be more widely publicized.

Maybe that\u2019s because echo chambers are boring.\nRight-wing congressman Paul Gosar and Donald Trump (Office of Paul Gosar)\nIn among the least surprising pieces of news ever, Donald Trump\u2019s social-media app Truth Social is turning out to be a huge flop. The site, which wants to be a conservative version of Twitter (which booted Trump from its site after the riot at the Capitol on January 6), debuted a little more than a month ago, but downloads of its app at the Apple Store have plummeted to an estimated 60,000 a week, according to mobile analytics firm Sensor Tower. Though there\u2019s supposedly a waitlist with a million names on it, the site itself, according to Forbes columnist John Brandon, looks like the proverbial \u201cghost town.\u201d Donald Trump, Jr. is assiduously posting away on the site. But it feels like he\u2019s mostly yelling into the void.\nTo be fair, creating a new social media site from whole cloth is a major challenge. Social-media companies benefit from network effects, so that the more users a site has, the more attractive it becomes others. That it makes it hard to dislodge existing players, since the simple fact that they have lots of users makes people want to stick around.\nBut the argument for Truth Social was that it could solve this problem because it had a ready-made core audience in the form of right-wingers (and specifically Trump supporters) who were annoyed with the liberal dominance and content-moderation policies of Twitter and would be more than happy to leave that site to hang out with other MAGAheads. Truth Social, the promise went, would offer them the opportunity to say what they want without fear of censorship, free of whinging liberals.\nSo what went wrong? Some of it, to be sure, is a function of the fact that the launch of Truth Social, like so much else in Trump\u2019s career, has been half-assed. Trump has yet to post since launch day, preferring instead to issue press statements that then get posted to Twitter, which is where he plainly wants to be. People who downloaded the app but were put on a waiting list are still there weeks later, which suggests a lack of investment in the back end. And Trump himself has done surprisingly (or perhaps unsurprisingly) little to promote the site.\nBeyond that, though, Truth Social faces a more fundamental problem, which is that it\u2019s not really clear most right-wingers only want to hang out with other right-wingers. To be sure, some do \u2014 but they already have social-media apps like Gab and Gettr, where denizens of the far right can indulge their penchant for conspiracy theories and complain about the New World Order to their heart\u2019s content. But a big part of right-wing identity today is built around the idea of \u201cowning the libs.\u201d That\u2019s why one of the constant refrains from right-wingers on social media is \u201cWhy don\u2019t you debate Ben Shapiro (or whomever)?\u201d In other words, they don\u2019t want to just be right. They also want to prove their correctness to liberals, and show them to be fools in the public eye.\nThe conventional take on social media and network structure is that social media isolates us from those who feel differently than we do, putting us into echo chambers that reinforce ideological homogeneity. But while it\u2019s true that most right-wingers inhabit echo chambers in terms of the media they consume \u2014 particularly broadcast media \u2014 when you look at analyses of social networks on places like Twitter, it\u2019s not true that right-wingers do not interact with people they disagree with. On the contrary, they interact with them plenty, even if only to argue with them and try to dunk on them. The appeal of echo chambers, it turns out, may be somewhat overrated, given that trolling libs and lecturing them about all the things they don\u2019t understand are, in fact, things right wingers love to do on Twitter. And they can\u2019t do any of those things on Truth Social. In that sense, the basic problem Truth Social faces is pretty straightforward: you can\u2019t own the libs if there are no libs around.", "comment_count": 25, "like_count": 773, "created_time": 1648781535558, "comment": [{"user_id": "46f93ea1809", "comment_time": 1648781535558, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "787bb9cd4ce3", "comment_time": 1648880753436, "comment": "Trump and truth should never again be in the same sentence."}, {"user_id": "9457da3e9686", "comment_time": 1648924131009, "comment": "One of the basic core tenets of bigotry is that bigots have to let the people they don\u2019t like know that they don\u2019t like them!

Then he posted it to his Facebook page.\nAlthough the apology was written as if it came from Chris Rock, the guy who wrote it was not trying to impersonate Rock or pretend that the statement came from him. In fact, his next post said something like, \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019d say, anyway.\u201d But for whatever reason, the post started to get attention from other Facebook users. That, at some point, made Facebook\u2019s algorithms kick in and elevate it, and soon enough the statement made the leap to other social-media sites, most notably Instagram and Twitter, where it was picked up and retweeted by users with massive followings.\nSomewhere in that process, though, something interesting happened: people started to think, and to say, that Chris Rock had actually made this apology that some random guy on Facebook had written. And it wasn\u2019t until Rock\u2019s publicist quashed the story, confirming that the apology was fake, that people realized they\u2019d been duped (or duped themselves, depending on your perspective).\nNow, from one angle you could say, \u201cJust another day on Twitter.\u201d But the fact that in a matter of hours, hundreds of thousands of people came to think a completely bogus statement was true speaks volumes about how easily misinformation can spread via social media, even when no one is trying especially hard to make that happen. In this case, after all, there was no army of Russian bots trying to get people to believe that Chris Rock had apologized. It was more like an organic case of collective stupidity on social media.\nMuch of this was the product, obviously, of the way social media works \u2014 it\u2019s built on the idea of influence and trend-following, which means that it wants its users to take their cues from others and from what others are doing. So if trusted high-profile accounts are retweeting something, their followers are going to assume it\u2019s true and are going to then like and retweet it themselves. That easily creates what economists call information cascades, where the decisions of early users (in this case, the decision to treat the apology as if it was real) end up having an inordinate impact on the decisions of those who come after them.\nYet even with all that, what remains striking to me about this story is that so many people \u2014 including people with tons of followers, who you might think would have some incentive to be accurate \u2014 clearly just post and retweet stuff without bothering to make even a cursory attempt to check that it\u2019s accurate. And they do this even when, as in this case, there are plenty of red flags. The fake apology was not posted on Rock\u2019s official social-media accounts or his website. It spelled \u201cmaking light\u201d as \u201cmaking lite.\u201d It had Rock referring to himself as a \u201crenown comedian,\u201d and the tone was so abject (it said telling the joke cost him \u201cthe enormous price of my reputation as a renown comedian\u201d) that it seemed utterly improbable Rock had written it. But none of that mattered to the people blithely posting the statement.\nSo what explains this (other than the fact that people are lazy)? In this case, some of people\u2019s lack of interest in checking to make sure the statement was real was the product of their desire to have Rock apologize (something that lots of people want him to do). In other words, they saw something they wanted to see, and weren\u2019t really interested in the possibility that it wasn\u2019t true.\nThere\u2019s also, though, something simpler at work, and that is that for most of us, our default assumption when confronted with something someone has said or written is that it\u2019s true. You might think that we would be naturally skeptical, especially when it comes to social media. But in fact, according to what the social psychologist Timothy Levine calls \u201ctruth default theory,\u201d most of us typically assume that what we\u2019re told is true, and we only change our mind when we find convincing evidence that it\u2019s not. And that assumption is all the harder to challenge when what we\u2019re being told is something we want to hear. (Confirmation bias is a hard thing to resist.)\nLevine argues that the fact that we default to assuming truth is actually a good thing, since most people are mostly honest, and it would therefore be a mistake, and quite time-consuming, to evaluate every statement as if people were lying to you. (To be sure, there are certain businesses where it would be a mistake to not assume that.) The problem is, of course, that people lie on the Internet all the time. Or sometimes they just post misleading stuff that they don\u2019t even know is misleading. Either way, defaulting to truth leaves a lot of people ill-equipped to deal with either of those realities. Which is why the mantra of any social-media user should be that old Ronald Reagan line about arms-control treaties with the Soviets: \u201cTrust, but verify.\u201d", "comment_count": 5, "like_count": 212, "created_time": 1648721614452, "comment": [{"user_id": "46f93ea1809", "comment_time": 1648721614452, "comment": "A Lie Gets Halfway Around Social Media While the Truth Is Still Getting Its Boots On"}, {"user_id": "e0ef3440e52b", "comment_time": 1648872627873, "comment": "It's not lies that travel halfway around social media.

All topics related to this unjustified, unnecessary and cruel war are by far emotional, also for me as an distant observer without direct relation to the Ukrainian people. #standwithukraine\nWith this article, I have tried to take a rational approach to the question of what role cryptocurrencies and blockchain play in the Ukraine war. With this article, I aim to provide an overview and evaluation of current discussions in the news, representing my personal opinion.\n# Introduction\nNever before have cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (and the underlying blockchain or distributed ledger technology) played such a major role in a war as they currently do in the Ukraine war.\nHowever, there are two contrasting narratives in the news with regard to this:\nPositive: Cryptocurrencies are a major opportunity for Ukrainian people to secure payments despite collapsing banking infrastructures as well as to keep their own assets safe; and for people, the Ukrainian government and NGOs to receive quick international donations supporting their fight against Russian invaders.\nNegative: Cryptocurrencies and the blockchain technology are weakening sanctions against Russia, as the Russian government, the Russian economy and oligarchs can still use them.\nA few observations at the beginning of the war in the crypto market:\nInvestors have stocked up on cryptocurrencies. For example, Bitcoin increased in price at the beginning of the war by more than 28 percent from around $34,300 to more than $44,000, according to the Coinbase platform. It became visible that especially in Russia and Ukraine the Bitcoin trade increased significantly. However, the price increase was only short-term and in the meantime, the price has roughly returned to pre-war levels. (see e.g. Tagesschau)\nTransactions between the Russian Ruble and cryptocurrencies have doubled since the start of the war, reaching $60 million per day, according to Chainalysis. In Ukraine, the crypto exchange Kuna even tripled its daily transaction volume temporarily. (see e.g. Tagesschau)\n\n# Russia\nJust in January 2022, the Russian Central Bank had called for a ban on cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin. Not much later, in early February, Russia\u2019s government and central bank had agreed to legalize cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and recognize them as a currency (Wirtschaftswoche).\nIn the meantime, as a consequence of invading into Ukraine, Russia has been excluded from the SWIFT banking communication system. In addition to this, the Russian government, Russian companies and various individuals and oligarchs have been placed on the sanctions list and, thus, have been excluded from a great part of the international banking and payment system.\nAccording to several media reports, cryptocurrencies now seem to be a viable payment alternative for Russian citizens, companies, as well as the government and oligarchs to circumvent these sanctions.\nIt is fundamental to understand at this point that trading cryptocurrencies based on blockchain technologies is not sanctionable in a purely technological term. While the exchange of fiat money and cryptocurrencies (e. g. from the Russian Ruble to Bitcoin via centralized exchanges such as Coinbase) can be regulated and sanctioned, the trading or exchange of cryptocurrencies (e. g. Bitcoin for Ether on decentralized crypto exchanges such as Uniswap) cannot be sanctioned. Sanctions can only be implemented if the identity can be verified. This is currently only possible in regulated centralized crypto exchanges through know-your-customer (KYC) requirements (e.g. in Germany).\nFurthermore, each transaction on the blockchain is completely transparent (while cryptographically encrypted). It is important to understand that cryptocurrencies are usually not completely anonymous, but merely pseudonymous. Existing crypto research, analytics or forensics providers (e. g. Chainalysis) have already specialized in tracking und uncovering supposedly anonymous transactions in connection with illegal activities. For example, law enforcement agencies are monitoring major bitcoin movements between different crypto addresses or wallets. The likelihood is currently very high that many of these large-volume transactions originate from the Russian oligarchs being sanctioned.\nDue to the transparency, privacy coins such as Monero or Zcash gained additional attention after the announcement of the sanctions against Russia, which in turn was reflected in the market price. Formerly, Bitcoin was also seen as a privacy coin. However, the increasing integration of cryptocurrencies into existing centralized payment systems and regulatory frameworks (including KYC requirements) has increasingly diminished anonymity in this regard. Privacy coins unlike other cryptocurrencies use techniques to make transactions almost completely anonymous. Privacy coins, in turn, might not be an optimal vehicle to circumvent sanctions on a larger scale as the transaction volume of privacy coins would not be sufficient and scalable enough. In addition, Monero, for example, is currently not practical enough because it cannot be used as a means of payment like Bitcoin due to a lacking broader acceptance as a means of payment.\nThere seem to be probably easier and less transparent ways for the Russian government and oligarchs to circumvent sanctions besides cryptocurrencies. For example, workarounds such as transactions via third countries (e.g. China) seem to be more feasible than a completely anonymous, untraceable conversion into cryptocurrencies, corresponding untraceable (small-volume) transactions, as well as the conversion back into fiat money in unregulated centralised crypto exchanges (as this would otherwise require KYC identification).\nSo far, cryptocurrencies seem to be mainly used in small-volume use cases by Russian private individuals. Cryptocurrencies do not seem to be a feasible short-term solution for companies to circumvent the sanctions, as system-side requirements in the payment processing infrastructure are lacking (Manager Magazin). According to Professor Dr. Sandner of the Frankfurt School Blockchain Center, it would take six to twelve months for this system-side conversion for at least parts of the Russian economy in order to being able to process cryptocurrencies for companies\u2019 payments (Manager Magazin). In addition, it can be assumed that due to the sanctions, hardly any company in Western countries would risk becoming liable to prosecution by accepting cryptocurrencies from Russian companies or individuals (KYC requirement assumed, in regulated crypto markets). However, Russia could also join the Chinese digital currency (the digital Yuan), for example, or continue to work on its own CBDC project.\n\nDue to the current debate about the role of cryptocurrencies to bypass sanctions, Mykhailo Fedorov (Vice Prime Minister of Ukraine and Minister of Digital Transformation of Ukraine) asked all central crypto exchanges to block all addresses of Russian users. Binance, Kraken and Coinbase, some of the largest crypto exchanges in the world, announced that they will not block the accounts of all Russian customers, as this would violate the principles of the distributed ledger technology (DLT) and cryptocurrencies. Binance and Coinbase, however, indicated that they provide support to the extent that they will explicitly block Russian customers / wallets that are on the sanctions list or related to \u201cillicit activities\u201d. For example, Coinbase reported that it blocked around 25,000 Russian addresses and passed them on to the Ukrainian government. (FinanceFWD, Tagesschau)\n\nBinance CEO Changpeng Zhao stated that the crypto market is currently far too small to be effectively used by Russia in evading sanctions. In addition, cryptocurrencies are also still not common enough in Russia for a widespread use, he added. Zhao also stressed that the share of crypto transactions associated with illegal activities was at an all-time low in 2021. Criminals would increasingly emigrate from the crypto market as it is too traceable. (t3n)\nIn general, in Russia, we can observe a similar phenomenon as in other countries: Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies become particularly attractive in times of a crisis and/or strong inflation, which we can see in countries such as El Salvador, Venezuela and Turkey. Nevertheless, cryptocurrencies are not used by the general population there either, but tend to be used by younger, digital affine people. In this regard, Russia is ranked 18th among all countries in terms of the use of cryptocurrencies by the population, according to the Global Crypto Adoption Index by Chainalysis 2021. On the other hand, Russia is ranked 3rd among countries with the largest share of Bitcoin mining in 2021 (Statista, approx. 11%).\n# Ukraine\nAccess to the banking infrastructure in Ukraine has been severely restricted through Russia\u2019s invasion and attacks. Ukrainian citizens and refugees have experienced tremendous problems withdrawing cash in order to take their savings with them or processing bank transactions or credit card payments. Once they arrive e. g. in Germany, Ukrainian refugees also face problems to exchange Hryvnia, the Ukrainian national currency, into Euros (as there are currently no government securities for banks for this risky currency exchange) and, thus, cannot be used as a means of payment (Spiegel, FAZ).\nAs a consequence, the Ukrainian population has increasingly bought and traded cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, because of the following reasons:\nRefugees trying to take their money with them.\nRefugees or citizens in the war zone receive money in this way through supporters and / or family members, without having to rely on a functioning banking system.\nPeople trying to hedge money against currency losses of their own currency.\nIf credit cards no longer work, cryptocurrencies still technically function as an alternative means of payment for essential goods.\nUkraine had already started to engage in cryptocurrencies before the war. In a global index by crypto research group Chainalysis last year, the country ranked fourth in the use of cryptocurrencies by its citizens (see also Financial Times).\nCryptocurrencies also play an important role for the Ukrainian government. The Ukrainian government has opened wallets for e. g. Bitcoin and Ethereum as well as launched a dedicated donation website for crypto donations, through which donations can be transferred and accepted within seconds. The government has received more than $100 million in cryptocurrency donations since the beginning of the war. This seem to be a small amount in comparison to the billions of donations from Western governments and the IMF. However, according to Oleksandr Bornyakov (Deputy Minister of Digital Transformation of Ukraine on IT industry development), cryptocurrencies have become an important tool of war due to their high flexibility and transaction speed (Financial Times). While Russia can hack centralized infrastructures via cyberattacks, it cannot hack cryptocurrencies on public blockchains if securely stored on e. g. cold wallets.\n\n\nLink\nIn addition to donations via cryptocurrencies, Ukraine is increasingly receiving large amounts of money via NFTs (non-fungible tokens, a digital asset such as digital art that is unique and non-exchangeable; thus, cannot be exchanged one-for-one like cryptocurrencies). For example, the Kremlin critical punk band Pussy Riot launched an auction of a picture of the Ukrainian flag as a NFT for donation and collected around 2,258 Ether \u2014 the equivalent of about $6.6 million (t3n). Another example is Wladimir Klitschko who recently launched an NFT collection with New York artist \u201cWhIsBe\u201d to help fund the war against Russia. The motive of the NFTs, which are sold via Opensea, are four new versions of the \u201cVandal Gummy\u201d bears created by \u201cWhIsBe\u201d (Business Insider, t3n).\n\nMykhailo Fedorov had originally planned to respond to the high volume of donations in cryptocurrencies with an airdrop (t3n). In the blockchain ecosystem, an airdrop is the often free distribution of digital assets / tokens by the developers of a particular blockchain project to the public or users. This is understood to be a marketing tactic to increase awareness of a project. However, the government ultimately abandoned this plan and prefers to work on its own NFTs \u2014 but explicitly not on fungible or exchangeable tokens such as its own cryptocurrency.\n\nThis will make the Ukrainian government the first industrialized country to issue its own collection of NFTs fixed on the blockchain. The plan is to launch a series of NFTs under the working title \u201cMeta History: Museum of War.\u201d The collection will include a token from each day of the war, with artwork corresponding to a news story. Bornyakov said the tokens would represent an immutable record on the blockchain that would not only document the conflict but also raise money for defense at the same time. (Financial Times)\nSuch alternative financial infrastructures can be used to maintain transactions for basic goods, but also to buy essential equipment for defence. The Ukrainian government says it has already spent half of its cryptocurrency donations on thousands of bulletproof vests, food rations, helmets and medical supplies, deliberately choosing to spend the funds on non-lethal equipment (Financial Times).\n# Conclusion\nThe \u201cworld\u2019s first crypto war\u201d (titled by the Washington Post) provides an answer to those who have previously asked about the use cases for cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. Looking in particular at the activities around the use of cryptocurrencies on the Ukrainian side, use cases for helping forcibly displaced persons can be derived. However, with regard to the risk of sanctions circumvention by Russia, it also becomes clear that the topic of regulation and KYC requirements should be thought globally \u2014 nonetheless responsibly and not exclusionary. When evaluating activities around cryptocurrencies, however, it is essential to include the country\u2019s context. Ukraine is certainly a pioneer in this regard, as the country has a large tech scene as well as a tech affine government.\nThe developments around the role of cryptocurrencies are currently still very dynamic and not fully transparent and predictable. It remains interesting to further observe how the role of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies \u2014 or the role of the blockchain technology in general \u2014 develops during and after the war for Ukraine but also for Russia. Above all, we can only hope for a short-term ending and withdrawal of the Russian army \u2014 for peace in Ukraine.\nI hope this article was valuable for you to read.

Although there are certainly critical developments, and distributed ledger technologies (DLT) is still in an early stage, this technology has a great potential to transform our society and to create a new inclusive approach to finance.\nWith this article I want to provide an introduction to and overview of this topic and to stimulate further discussion. It represents my personal opinion, independent of my professional employment. For simplification purposes, I use the terms DLT, blockchain and crypto interchangeably.\n# 1 \u2014 What is financial inclusion and why does it matter?\n\u201cFinancial inclusion means that individuals and businesses have access to useful and affordable financial products and services that meet their needs \u2014 transactions, payments, savings, credit and insurance \u2014 delivered in a responsible and sustainable way.\u201d (Worldbank)\nFinancial products and services are essential for everyone to be able to participate in economic development and growth, and to strengthen resilience. The latter is particularly relevant for individuals, households and SMEs when it comes to external shocks like Covid-19 or consequences of the climate change.\nHowever, a lot of people, particularly in developing countries, are excluded from the financial system and have no or limited access to essential financial services.\nAround 1.7 billion people worldwide lack access to financial services, especially in developing and emerging economies (Worldbank).\nAdults without a bank account globally (Global Findex, 2017)\n# 2 \u2014 What are the opportunities of blockchain for financial inclusion?\nBlockchain is in its origin a decentral technology without the need of intermediaries and with automate peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions using smart contracts. However, with regard to finance, we have to differentiate between two types of blockchain-based solutions:\nDeFi: completely decentralised finance, provides financial services without intermediaries (like banks) just by the power of code using DLT\nCeFi: centralised finance, also using cryptocurrencies, provided particularly by new fintech companies or traditional banks, which try to build the bridge between the decentral crypto world and our traditional finance system (including fiat money)\nFor a better understanding, here is a simplified comparison between both:\nSimplified comparison between DeFi und CeFi for blockchain-based finance solutions\nDeFi and CeFi both have advantages for an inclusive finance system, but sometimes to a different degree. Having the difference in mind, the crypto finance system, may overall have a huge impact on financial inclusion addressing various problems.\nOpen access: Geographical access to financial institutions is limited in certain countries, particularly in undeveloped and remote areas without a local banking infrastructure. Cryptocurrencies, DeFi and CeFi are globally accessible through the internet.\nIdentification and KYC: In traditional finance, people need personal documentation (ID, passport, proof of income, etc.) and fulfil KYC (Know-your-Customer) requirements to be able to open a bank account or get a credit. For people who lack valid identification such as e. g. refugees or people living in countries without nationwide full-coverage identity certification, this is often an insurmountable obstacle. Crypto wallets and DeFi solutions do not require traditional identification (in contrary to most CeFi solutions) and therefore are accessible by anyone.\nLow fees: DeFi (also partly CeFi) solutions mostly have significantly lower fees than traditional finance products (e. g. bank account or credit card fees). Often, the poorer population cannot afford traditional banking fees. This is particularly the case for remittances where individuals send money to support their families back home. A bitcoin transaction (on the Lightning Network, a layer-two scaling solution) can cost a fraction of a dollar in comparison to sometimes over 30% charge by Western Union.\nFast transactions: Cryptocurrency transactions take seconds to minutes to be transferred to another wallet, even when transferring it to another continent. Credit card transactions can take days to process and remittance payments even longer.\nTrust: Predominantly in countries with no stable financial system or government, people tend not to trust in financial institutions or products. DeFi and cryptocurrencies (trust in code and consensus mechanisms) may therefore be an alternative to CeFi (trust in crypto companies) besides the traditional finance system (trust in central banks and banks).\nThese advantages of blockchain-based solutions for financial inclusion are particularly evident in the subsequent use cases.\nDigital payments / remittances: Blockchain-based solutions and cryptocurrency transactions are cheaper, in real-time and permissionless (only DeFi). For digital payments, besides cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Central Banks Digital Currencies (CBDC) and stablecoins can play a major role. While cryptocurrencies are decentralized, unbacked and unregulated, CBDCs are the exact opposite (regulated, centralized, backed by a central bank / national currency). Stablecoins (e. g. USDT Tether) are decentralized or centralized, not regulated, but pegged to another currency.\nSaving / invest: For unbanked people, savings are often insecurely stored in cash or physical assets. Using DeFi / CeFi solutions or storing value in cryptocurrencies may be a more secure alternative. Furthermore, decentral investment products can be accessed by people which would otherwise not be able to earn money through investment products (e. g. staking, NFTs, play-to-earn games).\nCredit / lending: In the traditional credit system, scoring models (based on e. g. formal income and credit history) decide whether people are eligible to get a loan or not. Crypto-backed lending, particularly DeFi lending projects, provide access to loans through peer-to-peer transactions, based on automated protocols which facilitate elements from collateral to interest and which are accessible for anyone.\n# 3 \u2014 Every coin has two sides\u2026\nBesides promising opportunities, there are certainly risks and negative aspects which should be taken into consideration when discussing financial inclusion and blockchain.\nLacking digital and specifically blockchain literacy (in addition to general financial literacy) excludes people from using blockchain-based financial solutions. Blockchain is not an easy-to-understand technology, related products or cryptocurrencies require know-how and education. Providing open access to relevant education and information is therefore fundamental.\nPeople without or with limited internet access have no possibility to take advantage of this technology. Internet access is often unaffordable in developing countries. In the 46 least-developed countries, almost three-quarters of people have never used the internet. Global internet penetration rate is only around 60%.\nData and cyber security are a major problem (but not only in DLT). The risk may be higher in CeFi (hackable central database) than in DeFi (flaws in code, also e.g. bridges between different blockchains \u2014 e. g. the current Solana Wormhole hack). While in traditional finance victims are usually compensated by the bank, this is not the case in DeFi. Poorer people are hit harder by a hack, relatively speaking, because they are fundamentally dependent on their money. Using a cold wallet is therefore essential to mitigate risks.\nHigh volatility in cryptocurrencies may hit vulnerable groups harder as they are more reliant on their money. The day-to-day fluctuations can be in the order of 10%. However, in countries with high inflation rates cryptocurrencies might nevertheless be an attractive solution in comparison to fiat money. Moreover, stablecoins or CBDCs are another alternative.\nThe decentralization idea of blockchain technologies (the aim of reducing reliance on authorities and central decision makers), could be fundamentally in conflict with interests of governments, which could then prohibit or strictly regulate access to related solutions (which is only to a certain degree possible with regard to DeFi). Countries such as Egypt, Iraq, Qatar, Oman, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Bangladesh and China have all officially banned cryptocurrencies. China is now pushing their own CBDC, the digital Yuan, which they instead of decentral cryptocurrencies, have full control over (see e. g. Fortune).\n# 4 \u2014 Interesting global developments to observe\nThere are currently many examples and country use cases where blockchain is being adopted, having an impact on people\u2019s financial inclusion \u2014 which are worth observing and learning from, for instance:\nEl Salvador: In September 2021 the government introduced Bitcoin as a legal tender within the country. Since the introduction, approximately 50% of the country\u2019s population uses the country\u2019s Bitcoin wallet \u201cChivo\u201d (which uses the Lightning Network). In comparison, approximately 70% of the population does not have a bank account. The Chivo app is particularly used for remittances (for further details see e. g. Worldbank, PwC).\nTurkey: The financial crisis in Turkey and hyperinflation of Lira above 30% led to mistrust in the official currency and to an increase cryptocurrency adoption. President Erdo\u011fan declared that \u201cwe are in a war against Bitcoin\u201d (The Guardian). Already more than 16% of the Turkish population uses cryptocurrencies (Statista).\nNigeria: The Central Bank of Nigeria launched the country\u2019s CBDC called \u201ceNaira\u201d on October 2021. In the beginning, the eNaira can exclusively be accessed by people with bank accounts. However, this should be expanded to anyone using a mobile phone. Currently, 36% of the Nigerian adult population do not have a bank account (IMF). Nigeria is, by the way, one of the leading countries with regard to cryptocurrency adoption with 32% of the population using cryptocurrencies (Statista).\n# 5 \u2014 Concluding remarks\nFinancial inclusion has historically been driven in particular by the work of governments, central banks and international development organisations. With the emergence and growing popularity of DLT and DeFi, a very interesting parallel development can be observed. Promising approaches to an alternative, open and inclusive financial system are arising, some perhaps even unintentionally. Decentralized communities are working towards the transformation of the financial world \u2014 DeFi products are developed, tested and already reaching millions of people.\nThe \u201ccrypto world\u201d and the blockchain technologies behind it are certainly still in their infancy. If we look at it as just the beginning of a new open and inclusive financial system, we can agree that it is not perfect yet. But it is heading in the right direction. In any new system, you have to test, fail and learn, and trade-offs are inevitable for development and growth. However, it is worth \u2014 even for the most sceptical ones \u2014 to observe and learn from these developments, and clarify myths and narratives around these technologies with facts based on experiences.\nAdditional remarks\nI hope you enjoyed reading this article.

Now, with social events canceled and many people working from home, the situation is more dire \u2014 and might seem intractable. After all, how can you safely meet new people during a pandemic?\nLike many people, I\u2019ve been looking for more connection these days. After many months of no work travel and canceled social events, it\u2019s easy to feel isolated. My first thought was that I needed to challenge myself to meet new people \u2014 difficult in the middle of a pandemic. But it turns out you don\u2019t have to meet anyone new to feel more connected. \u201cWe\u2019re not lonely for more interaction. We\u2019re lonely for more meaningfulness,\u201d says Shasta Nelson, author of the books The Business of Friendship and Friendships Don\u2019t Just Happen!\nFriendships are built through consistency, positivity, and vulnerability (that is, being emotionally open), Nelson says. The first quality enables the other two.\nWith those qualities in mind, you can transform a friendship \u2014 or even an acquaintance \u2014 into a much more meaningful relationship.\nSee who you see\n\u201cThe most likely potential friends will be the people you\u2019re already seeing or could potentially see regularly without either of you having to do much about it,\u201d Nelson says. So, where do you go often? The dog park? A house of worship? Your kids\u2019 schools? Start paying attention to the people you interact with frequently.\nMake a list\nAs you note the people you see, Nelson suggests asking yourself, \u201cWho do I enjoy? Who am I more curious about? Am I excited when they reach out?\u201d Then, make a list. \u201cStart with a Post-it note,\u201d she says. \u201cThree to five names. You don\u2019t have to overthink it. Who do you like and gravitate toward?\u201d\nInvest the time\nA few years ago, Nelson made such a list of five casual acquaintances who intrigued her. She told them, \u201cI\u2019m giving you fair warning: You\u2019re my priority this year.\u201d That might seem a bit forward, but she said, \u201cThey all loved it,\u201d because \u201cpeople want to feel loved and liked.\u201d Making someone a priority means making time for them.\nBe prepared to share\nNo, the new acquaintance at the dog park probably doesn\u2019t want your whole life story the first time you talk. But as you start getting together with someone frequently, you can take responsibility for figuring out what would make you feel seen. Nelson recommends asking yourself before any get-together, \u201cWhat do I most want to share today? What would I like this person to know?\u201d Of course, if you\u2019re going to share, you also need to\u2026\nBe prepared to listen\nFriendship requires reciprocity. Go into any get-together with a few open-ended questions that will elicit real answers, like \u201cWhat are you most looking forward to right now?\u201d Over time, you and your chosen new friends will open up to each other, and however many friends you wind up having, you\u2019ll feel less lonely \u2014 and more connected and loved.", "comment_count": 5, "like_count": 658, "created_time": 1603920805221, "comment": [{"user_id": "7ff56d802184", "comment_time": 1603920805221, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "bb4f7d003f34", "comment_time": 1603952374196, "comment": "In difficult times we need to work and focus."}, {"user_id": "8c7f92ce547a", "comment_time": 1604033852635, "comment": "Much needed in difficult times such as these.

While she had managed life with one baby quite well, juggling two little ones and a burgeoning workload was wearing her out. After a rough patch of limited sleep, she wrote me that even though she liked her work, she\u2019d been thinking about resigning, and accepting that \u201cI can\u2019t have it all anymore.\u201d\nI wrote back that the first few months with an infant aren\u2019t easy on anyone. But when things go wrong, I try to repeat this phrase: Don\u2019t draw too broad a conclusion. The human brain is wired to avoid pain, and one way to redeem a bad situation is to try to learn a lesson. That way, the brain thinks, you won\u2019t experience that pain again. But if you\u2019re not careful, you can learn the wrong lesson, or draw such a broad conclusion that you cut yourself off from a lot of good things. And that could be even more painful than the first problem.\n\nIf you look around, you see that the tendency to draw broad conclusions comes up again and again. Someone has a bad experience during an international trip and decides it\u2019s better to stay close to home where they\u2019re less likely to miss an important announcement on the train because they don\u2019t understand the language (or eat something that disagrees with them). Back when the stock market tanked in 2008, a friend told me that he\u2019d gotten out completely \u2014 he wasn\u2019t going to lose 30 percent of his money ever again!\nHe drew a broad lesson, but it wasn\u2019t a wise lesson. The S&P was back up to where it had been in a year or two, and then went on a meteoric rise over the next decade. If my friend stuck with his conclusion, then his portfolio wouldn\u2019t have lost 30 percent of its value in a stock market crash, but it would have lost 30 percent of its value to inflation sitting in a savings account. And that\u2019s before we even get to the opportunity cost of missed long-term returns.\nLikewise, someone who decides to stay close to home won\u2019t experience whatever travel woe befuddled them during that adventure. But they will lose out on being exposed to all sorts of amazing things that happen in the broader world.\nSo it\u2019s better to draw smaller conclusions rather than big ones. A rough trip doesn\u2019t need to teach the lesson that you should stay home. Instead, you could learn that it might be helpful to travel with a guide or a friend who speaks the language. It might mean being careful about what you order in new places (pizza might be better than an undercooked steak). Or it might mean recognizing that everyone has bad days now and then, whether abroad or at home, and such is the human condition.\nSimilarly, an investor who gets burned could decide that it\u2019s good to have a big emergency fund to ward off panic, and to be diversified, with some more stable investments and some index funds to capture the upside. These smaller conclusions can address the original pain without foreclosing good things.\nAs for the woman who worried she can\u2019t have it all? She will eventually sleep again. In the meantime, rather than walking away from a job that she does like, with all the economic peril associated with that, she could decide that she needs more help at home. Or she could decide that she should negotiate for a lighter workload for the next six months, or that maybe now is not the time to set exercise goals or do anything strenuous in the rest of her life. These smaller conclusions might serve her better.\nNo one likes pain in whatever form it comes. We convince ourselves that by drawing the right conclusion, we will never experience that pain again. And maybe we won\u2019t. But pain in some form is inevitable. No epiphany can make it disappear from life completely. By drawing little conclusions instead of big ones we keep ourselves from experiencing other sorts of pain that actually didn\u2019t have to happen.", "comment_count": 4, "like_count": 499, "created_time": 1649345769563, "comment": [{"user_id": "7ff56d802184", "comment_time": 1649345769563, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "32711371b02c", "comment_time": 1649656477678, "comment": "Thank you laura for your article, this hits home hard for me as I used to draw a big conclusion as i was afraid of failing and being hurt :("}, {"user_id": "489179ae342e", "comment_time": 1649699438699, "comment": "Very interesting and unique perspective.

Everyone says \u201chey, we should get together!\u201d but this person finds a date and makes the restaurant reservation. After a family meet-up in a park, everyone says \u201cwe should do this again!\u201d but this person suggests meeting next Saturday at the children\u2019s museum at 10 a.m. since the forecast calls for rain.\nIf you are reading this article on planning, my guess is that you are this person. You organize get-togethers with your friends all the time. That\u2019s why you have wonderful things going on in your life! The only fly in the ointment is that sometimes you might wonder why other people don\u2019t do as much or even any of the planning. You might wonder if they\u2019re as invested in the friendship as you are. When you like people, you extend invitations for specific times. If other people don\u2019t do that, is it because they don\u2019t like you as much? You might hold back, worried that you are misjudging things.\nBut before you stop trying, understand this: It\u2019s OK to be the planner. Your gift is logistics and coordination. Other people have different gifts. Appreciating that makes it possible to enjoy friendships more.\nThose of us who do a lot of planning for ourselves, for our jobs, and for our families, know that it is work. Even fun things, like a date night, or a group spa visit, take effort. There are ways to decrease the effort \u2014 one reason I suggest scheduling recurring get-togethers, like a first Sunday of the month supper club \u2014 but coordinating busy human beings is never a seamless process.\nPeople who do this planning all the time tend to assume that others can do it too. They might not enjoy it, but we don\u2019t always enjoy it either. We don\u2019t stop to consider that the intricate planning required to organize group activities is a skill. Saying anyone can do it is kind of like saying anyone can sing the Hallelujah Chorus, or write a sonnet in iambic pentameter, or make Beef Wellington. It is true, but without practice it is going to be a lot harder. And the outcome might not be that attractive.\nMany people find it challenging to imagine something they would like to do in the future, think of the people they would like to do it with (and who would probably want to do it as well), and coordinate schedules and logistics to make it happen.\nIf these people are friends with you, well, it\u2019s like wanting to eat great foods and being friends with a talented chef. Inevitably you are going to be the one doing the metaphorical cooking, which in this case means coming up with things to do, extending invitations, making sure the time and logistics work with everyone\u2019s schedules, following up to be sure people are coming, and getting the next get-together on the books before the last one is done.\nIs it fair? Maybe not, but here\u2019s the thing. If you extend invitations to people and they keep saying yes, then they want to spend time with you. If they didn\u2019t want to see you, they\u2019d either say they were busy, or take a long time to respond. Since they keep saying yes, they are equally excited about your plans. You want to see them, they want to see you, and thanks to your plans, this is happening. All is good.\nThe worst thing you could do is engage in a game of social chicken, where you decide to not extend invitations for a while to see if other people get the hint. Maybe they will. But most likely what will happen is that you won\u2019t see each other for months or longer. You didn\u2019t have to check your calendar, send some texts, and make a reservation, but you didn\u2019t get to see your friends either. How was that better?\nFar better to accept that it is OK to be the planner. Planning is a skill that you have developed. Other people have different skills. Think about why you enjoy hanging out with your friends. Maybe it\u2019s their sense of humor, or energy, or the way someone always asks the right questions. You can appreciate these attributes in the same way that other people can appreciate your logistical prowess. The get-together wouldn\u2019t happen without your contribution. But it wouldn\u2019t be as fun without your friends.

You\u2019re in the middle of a busy week. You\u2019re barely keeping your head above water. You need more hours, yet somehow, on Thursday morning, you see that you\u2019ll be traveling downtown to your local conference center to participate in a panel on a topic that you\u2019ve been moving away from in your career. At this point, canceling would be embarrassing. But you\u2019re kicking yourself on the drive there. What happened?\nWhat happened is that when you said yes to this commitment a year earlier, your schedule seemed completely open. It\u2019s hard to say no, and how were you supposed to know that Future You would be slammed? But asking one simple question before taking on any commitment can raise the chances that when you do whatever you agreed to do, you\u2019ll actually want to do it.\nHumans aren\u2019t naturally good at considering our future selves. There\u2019s some research finding that we view our future selves almost as strangers. We\u2019re not sure what our future selves will be thinking, doing, or feeling.\nThat\u2019s a problem \u2014 and not just for questions like whether we\u2019re saving enough for retirement. When we are asked to do things far in the future, it feels like we\u2019re assigning them to an entirely different person. Saying no means experiencing some unpleasantness now, whereas saying yes means passing this obligation onto what feels like someone else. I won\u2019t be busy next February! Next February I\u2019ll have tons of time. And on some absurd level it makes sense. If you look at February on next year\u2019s calendar now, it will be almost completely blank.\nBut, sadly, come next February, your calendar will no longer look as untouched as the new fallen snow. You will be the same person you are now. You will be just as busy. Only now you will also have this other commitment that you were lukewarm about 11 months before. Extricating yourself will be difficult.\nThere needs to be a way to make future commitments feel more real. The best way to do that is to ask this simple question: Would I do this tomorrow?\nIf you\u2019re weighing taking something on, ask if you would be willing to do it very soon. Would you do it tomorrow, or at least this week, even with all you have going on now? Sure, your schedule is packed, but would you be willing to move things around or cancel things in order to do this?\nFor some things, the answer will be a wholehearted yes. I imagine most of us would chop up our schedules to join a friend who just won tickets to go see a favorite band play in a venue the next state over. I imagine most of us would reshuffle the work decks to go pitch a project to a client we\u2019ve been chasing for months. If your company\u2019s CEO wanted you to join her on a panel this Friday to talk about the great work you\u2019re doing, you\u2019d want to do it. And so, chances are, you\u2019d want to do it six months from now too.\nBut if you find yourself saying no, I\u2019m too busy tomorrow, or feeling like you wouldn\u2019t want to rearrange things to drive 90 minutes somewhere tomorrow, that should probably be your answer for the future too. You aren\u2019t going to magically get more excited about things you\u2019re not excited about now. And yet Future You will have to take on this commitment for Future You\u2019s tomorrow \u2014 even if Future You is incredibly busy.\nThe future may look blank right now, but the opportunity cost of this future time isn\u2019t nothing. To reinforce this realization. I like to remind myself that I have the power to turn blank future slots into something wonderful. I could buy tickets to see a favorite band play in a venue the next state over. If there\u2019s someone I\u2019d like to work with, nothing is stopping me from thinking through options and working my network. I need to weigh potential future commitments against those opportunities, and not against a feeling that I won\u2019t have anything going on.\nNothing is stopping you from turning the blank future into something you\u2019d want to do either. Well, except being too busy.

Screenshot by the author.\nSound familiar?\nAs a philosopher and writer, I\u2019ve had my fair share of people misreading my writings. Yes, as Baggini laments, it\u2019s to the extent of people thinking I\u2019ve said the opposite of what I actually mean. Since I started my career as a philosophy undergraduate, our professors made huge efforts in reminding me to be clear and concise with my writings.\nOne of my professor\u2019s lines \u2014 paraphrasing Quinitilian \u2014 was, \u201cDo not write so that you can be understood, but so that you cannot be misunderstood.\u201d Our professors gave us many pointers. Too many, in fact. \u201cWrite in active voice.\u201d \u201cIf you have more than two connectors in a sentence, start a new sentence.\u201d The list goes on.\nSince day one, I\u2019ve made efforts to ensure that my writings cannot possibly be misunderstood. And I\u2019m sure many good and hardworking writers out there endeavor to do the same as well.\nBut the sad reality is that we are still constantly being misunderstood and misread. People write comments that are completely irrelevant to what we\u2019ve written. Some go so far as to accuse us of things we\u2019ve not written at all.\nI can certainly sympathize with Baggini. As an aspiring philosopher, communication is our bread and butter. We are often dealing with complicated ideas. And when we\u2019re misread despite our best efforts to make our writings clear, it\u2019s extremely disheartening. We feel as if we haven\u2019t done a good enough job.\nSo, whilst we constantly work to improve our writings, perhaps it would be helpful to understand why we are cursed to forever misunderstand one another. And whilst we critique others for their inability to be charitable, perhaps we could also work on our charitability towards others.\nWhy We Keep Misunderstanding One Another?\nMisunderstandings have been occurring for as long as we\u2019ve started writing. Authors throughout history have faced criticisms founded on misunderstandings, despite how often they tried to clarify their positions and vindicate themselves from unfair charges. One of my favorite academic conversations was between philosophers Thomas Kuhn and Karl Popper, where Kuhn constantly accuses Popper of misunderstanding his thesis on scientific progress. (See here for more.)\nIn one interview, Kuhn finally laments, \u201cI remember being invited to attend and talk to a seminar at Princeton organized by undergraduates during the times of trouble. And I kept saying, \u2018But I didn\u2019t say that! But I didn\u2019t say that! But I didn\u2019t say that!\u2019\u201d\nWe like to blame social media for much of our misunderstanding today. Indeed, the democratization of information and entertainment brought by social media means instant-gratification monkeys like us get gratified instantly. Many critics of social media argued that the sheer amount of information has severely reduced our capacity to properly filter and digest the information we come across.\nEverything\u2019s moving so quickly. We\u2019re spoilt for choices. So, we inevitably lose any capacity to properly assimilate the information we encounter.\nBut that\u2019s not entirely true. While it\u2019s undeniable that the Internet has spoiled us for choices and desensitized us to the sorts of information we consume, it isn\u2019t the cause of our constant misunderstanding of one another. Instead, recent technological advancement has only made what\u2019s already faulty with us manifest even clearly: we suck at empathizing, and we suck at thinking.\nOne of the major reasons we constantly misinterpret others and their messages is psychology: we\u2019re extremely lazy thinkers. Psychologists call us \u201ccognitive misers\u201d because we hate thinking. Thinking is exhausting. So, we subconsciously and consciously avoid it.\nAccording to psychologist Daniel Kahneman, our mind consists of two cognitive systems: the fast, intuitive, and effortless System 1, and the slow, deliberate, and exhausting System 2. System 1 is in control most of the time. We use it to process quick and simple information like \u201c1+1=2\u201d or \u201cThere\u2019s a cat.\u201d System 2 takes over when a task requires more deliberation. For instance, driving and solving \u201c123 x 456\u201d would engage System 2.\nMost of us let System 1 dictate everyday discourse. And normally, there\u2019s really nothing wrong with it. Everything moves around us quickly that we need to properly adapt to these changes. For instance, we\u2019re accustomed to anticipating speeches. We\u2019re so good at doing this that it mostly operates subconsciously. Here\u2019s an example: suppose you and I were conversing. In the midst of the conversation, I said, \u201cYes, I was sick yesterday. I went to the clinic to see\u2026\u201d\nI needn\u2019t finish the sentence for you to start making sense of what I was saying. You\u2019d probably have anticipated what I wanted to say and intuitively filled in \u201cthe doctor.\u201d I can also guarantee that it took no deliberative effort on your part to do so. It\u2019s all quick, intuitive, and effortless. When it comes to reading and comprehending the works of others, or listening and interpreting the verbal or bodily messages of others, System 1 takes over most of the time.\nBut System 1 is often erroneous.\nKahneman gives us an example. Consider the following syllogism:\nAll roses are flowers.\nSome flowers fade quickly.\nTherefore, some roses fade quickly.\nHe and Shane Federick tested this on university students. The majority of them found this syllogism valid. It\u2019s not. After testing these students on more similar \u201cbrain teasers,\u201d Kahneman concludes:\nEveryone has the option of slowing down to conduct an active search of memory for all possibly relevant facts \u2014 just as they could slow down to check the intuitive answer to [these problems] \u2026. The ease with which they are satisfied enough to stop thinking is rather troubling. \u201cLazy\u201d is a harsh judgment \u2026 but it does not seem to be unfair.\u201d\nWhy We All Need An Arbiter\nOne of the first things we\u2019re trained in academic philosophy is critiquing. This, as we\u2019ve experienced, is no easy task. Most of our courses are structured so that we have weeks and months to offer a short, humble critique of another philosopher\u2019s idea. We\u2019re constantly warned against being overly ambitious. Mischaracterization, hasty generalization, and strawman arguments are mistakes.\nWhen we\u2019re in school, there were arbiters discouraging us from making ludicrous mistakes like these. And when we\u2019ve possibly misunderstood something, there\u2019s someone else \u2014 presumably with authority \u2014 to correct us. But as we grow older, these arbiters gradually fade away. No longer are there people to arbitrate our judgments. In other words, we\u2019re free.\nWhen technology democratizes information, and social media connects us with everyone, they have done so in the absence of an arbiter. People are free to communicate their thoughts and ideas. But this also opens up people to constantly misinterpret and misunderstand one another. We\u2019re no longer immediately held accountable for our judgments, as no authorities hold us accountable for our mistakes.\nPhilosopher Brian Leiter shares a similar concern. In his essay, \u201cThe Case Against Free Speech,\u201d he argues that free speech without an epistemic arbiter has no positive epistemic value. In other words, without someone to define the limits of our speech, free speech has no value.\nTo justify his case, he invites us to think of the many institutions of the free world that impose heavy restrictions on free speech to realize the ends of liberal democracy. In particular, he invites us to think about the classroom and the legal processes of justice.\nIn universities and schools, for example, no one thinks the classroom should be turned over to unregulated expression of opinion, without regard to cognitive value, civility, or pedagogical purpose \u2026. If speech were actually \u2018free\u2019 in the courts \u2014 that is, unrestricted by state power \u2014 then there would be almost no need for most rules of evidence. A judge or judges would be summoned as the official arbiters, triers of fact (if different) would be assembled, and then the parties, or their advocates, would say anything and everything, adduce any and all evidence that they believe might help their case.\nWhen we\u2019re left on our own, we let the \u201clazy\u201d System 1 take over most of our thinking. We think fast. But we think very lazily \u2014 and stupidly.\nMost of us would agree that when there\u2019re things at stake, we need an epistemic arbiter. In the courtroom, justice is at stake, so we need to restrict discourse to those who are apt in the law: lawyers and judges. In the classroom, knowledge is at stake, so we implement an arbiter of knowledge: the educator.\nIn these social settings, when there are important things at stake, we set up arbiters to dictate the norms of discourse. We also voluntarily give authority to these arbiters to tell us what\u2019s right and wrong, what we can and cannot say in certain social settings.\nSo, why do we think we could do away with an arbiter in, say, political discourse? Or everyday discourse?\nWe Can Be Our Own Arbiter\nIt makes little sense to appoint an arbiter to every social media platform. Indeed, to regulate communication to the extent of everyday discourse is extremely Orwellian. It\u2019s implausible on a state level, and it imposes a severe threat to individual autonomy.\nBut on the other hand, we need some form of arbitration. As long as we admit that our discourse and communication have something at stake, we need an arbiter. It could be something as mundane as securing a business deal or ordering at McDonald\u2019s. As long as misunderstanding will incur a loss, we need an arbiter.\nThe simplest semi-solution to this is to practice empathy. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ve all been told to \u201cput ourselves in the shoes of others\u201d since young. When we\u2019re in school, teachers do a good job reminding us of that. When we\u2019re at home, our parents remind us about that. But when those physical arbiters are absent, we revert to our lazy System 1 because empathizing is exhausting.\nTo be charitable in everyday communication is to simply realize that people can misunderstand one another. As speakers and writers, we\u2019re prone to making errors. And as listeners and readers, we\u2019re also prone to making false judgments about others.\nOne of my professor\u2019s best advice was, \u201cIf you think someone is saying something stupid, you\u2019re likely mistaken.\u201d\nOf course, many people say many stupid things. But the point was to remind us to be charitable, to assume that perhaps, we\u2019ve read the author wrongly insofar as they\u2019ve said something incredibly stupid.\nIn a world where free speech is a right rather than a luxury, and where technology has made us all commentators of the works and lives of others, freedom is a cursed blessing. Insofar as we bask in this freedom, we have to consciously practice restraint on our part. Today, the realm of political discourse is a fine mess, no thanks to the perpetuated \u201cmarketplace of ideas.\u201d We could, at least, do our part to return to it some sincerity and humility.", "comment_count": 5, "like_count": 274, "created_time": 1628943026333, "comment": [{"user_id": "46a88d5008a8", "comment_time": 1628943026333, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "6635914ff3f7", "comment_time": 1629790382032, "comment": "Yes!

The story, according to my sociology professor, is \u201ccomplex.\u201d So, I\u2019ll try my best to sum it up. Educators and staff of higher education aren\u2019t pleased with how they\u2019re paid, so they decided to go on strike for 10 days. Well, that\u2019s really it. So, how is it \u201ccomplex?\u201d\nWhile my professor didn\u2019t elaborate on what he meant by \u201ccomplex,\u201d I can wager I know a fair bit of what\u2019s going on, seeing how I had a similar dispute over my wage a couple of months back. And here, we\u2019re seeing something almost identical: employees are getting paid nuts while those above the corporate ladder suck the life (money, really) out of the institution we call the university.\nIf I could sum up the \u201ccomplexity\u201d in a term, it\u2019ll be structural inequality. To put it crudely, everyone who\u2019s playing the (economic) game of higher education is bound to lose to all but one player: the employer.\nTo illustrate this even further, let me recount a piece of conversation that occurred in one of my tutorials on the day the strike was announced. My tutor shared how measly her wage was (it was, indeed, pathetic) and passionately ranted about how she\u2019s being duped into precarious employment. She was paid \u00a315 an hour on a short-term contract. (As a contrast, my wage is \u00a313, and I\u2019m working in Asia.)\nAmongst the rant, one astute student raises her hand and then asks, \u201cWait, so where does our tuition fee go to, then?\u201d That\u2019s the million-dollar question, isn\u2019t it?\nThis entire conversation reminded me of everything I\u2019ve gone through last year when I found out that my employer is taking over 80% of our income when there are little overhead costs. Of course, I immediately disputed this, and overnight, I got my current wage. (See my story here.) But I digress. This isn\u2019t about me. It\u2019s really about how structural inequality can be so powerful in today\u2019s neo-liberal societies.\nExploiting Consumer Apathy And Unfreedom\nWhen I first read about the strikes, I quickly dismissed their effectiveness. I do so for two reasons. First, there\u2019ll always be people who\u2019re willing to take up jobs no matter how unfair the wages seem. This trend is especially true in Asia. And for any society that can rake in foreign labor, the supply of cheap labor will never diminish. Second, as long as the consumers are oblivious to the suffering, it will never be resolved. This second reason is especially potent.\nHere\u2019s an illustration. When you go for a cup of coffee in Starbucks knowing well that you\u2019re overcharged, how often do you think about what you\u2019re spending on? Chances are, never. For the times that we do, we naively think we\u2019re merely spending on coffee. The more business-inclined of us would think we\u2019re paying this entity called \u201cStarbucks.\u201d\nNever, I mean ever, do we think that we\u2019re paying the employees, the coffees growers, the people who exported the beans, the people who supplied the equipment, etc. When Marx talked about alienation, he talked about employees being separated from the fruits of their labor. Here, as consumers, we are alienated from the production as well.\nBy chance, I had a conversation with another student about the strikes. I asked, \u201cHow would you feel if you knew the majority of your tuition fees don\u2019t go to the teaching staff, resources, or facilities? That most go to the people, you wouldn\u2019t even give a rat\u2019s ass about?\u201d\nAt first, he replied, \u201cI never thought of that.\u201d Well, most of us won\u2019t. We don\u2019t need that guilty conscience when we spend on something.\nThen, he went on to say that he\u2019s comfortable as long as he also knows he can do nothing about it. Herein lies the real problem. Everyone wants a degree. And the only way to get a degree is to pay universities an absurd amount of money to get it. But in doing so, everyone takes comfort in knowing that they can do nothing about the structural inequality they\u2019re reproducing.\nIn other words, our apathy combined with our sense of powerlessness will doom educators into constant oppression. Because our desire for a degree justifies whatever means necessary to get it, we turn a blind eye towards those who\u2019re suffering in helping us get there.\nSo, while I fully empathize with the strikers and genuinely hope the disputes resolve in their favor, I cannot help but be pessimistic about the outcome. Because the people who need to go on strike are the consumers of higher education, i.e., us students, not our lecturers and support staff. That\u2019s the challenge.\nCapitalism does an extremely good job of \u201cdisconnecting\u201d us as human beings. Insofar as the teaching staff is an indispensable unit in our education, we, the consumers, don\u2019t see it that way. We don\u2019t really notice if our educators are fairly compensated\u2014those few ones who do usually resign to this damning fate.\nResponsible Consuming\nEnsuring that we\u2019re consuming responsibly isn\u2019t a new trend: we stopped using plastic bags indiscriminately, we want our food sources to be sustainable. All these started with raising awareness and by mandatory practices \u2014 if markets didn\u2019t stop using plastic bags, I highly doubt I\u2019d bring my own bag. I\u2019d even pay for one.\nTo end, I like to invite everyone reading to think about how we\u2019re consuming goods. Precisely, I invite us to think about where most of our money spent on goods goes to. I\u2019m not saying to stop buying from Nike or Starbucks. Rather, I\u2019m inviting us to think about our role in reproducing the various social inequalities worldwide. And if we have a responsibility to mitigate this process.\nThanks Squeeze the Avocado, for the prompt.

We can\u2019t be sure if either of them would survive without intensive care. One of them is fully vaccinated. Though fully capable of being vaccinated, the other decided not to (one could assume that he has fallen prey to several conspiracy theories.) Of course, all else being equal, the fully vaccinated patient has a higher chance of surviving.\nWho should we attend to?\n\u201cLet The Unvaccinated Die\u201d\nNow, intuitively, some of us would say, \u201cHell, of course, we attend to the vaccinated patient!\u201d\nIndeed, not only is it the most utilitarian response, but somehow it feels right to treat the vaccinated. More precisely, there\u2019s a sense of \u201cdesert\u201d here. We think criminals ought to get their deserved punishment. But we also think those who are more willing to be helped ought to be helped. In other words, some (and, honestly, I) would think that we should let the unvaccinated get what they deserve.\nYet, as a moral philosopher, I shouldn\u2019t dismiss any opposing view just because they have bad taste.\nThere are definitely people out there who rejected this utilitarian view. They argued that healthcare systems should not discriminate against patients. Regardless of race, religion, criminal records, everyone should deserve the same healthcare service.\nThis seemingly egalitarian and \u201canti-meritocratic\u201d moral view, if it comes to the situation where we have to choose between who to save, the fairest way to do so is through a lottery. Instead of personally analyzing who should be admitted, we should randomly choose between \u201celigible\u201d candidates.\nNow, since both the vaccinated and unvaccinated deserve the same healthcare, there shouldn\u2019t be anything else that justifies our favoring of one over the other. Yes, brought to the extreme, this moral view justifies directing limited resources to possibly dying criminals and psychopaths instead of to law-abiding citizens.\nInterestingly, philosopher Michael Sandel purports a similar idea regarding college admissions. He argued that it\u2019s fairer that eligible students be selected by lottery rather than having recruiters personally evaluate these students.\nMeritocracy, Sandel argues in The Tyranny of Merit, cultivates a sense of morally unjustifiable hubris among the winners and a sense of unjustifiable shame among the losers. True justice will compensate the losers as much as it rewards the winners. But meritocracy doesn't.\nChoosing to attend to the vaccinated over the unvaccinated is a form of meritocracy. And if Sandel\u2019s critique is right, then we should indeed select eligible patients to attend to randomly. (Of course, Sandel\u2019s critique is far too nuanced to be an accurate comparison here.)\nOn A Moral High Ground\nThat said, I can\u2019t help but think of a perfect scene in Batman \u2014 The Dark Knight where the Joker plants a bomb in two ships. One is carrying normal civilians, and the other carries prisoners. Each ship is given a remote detonator to the other ship. So, the civilians\u2019 ship could blow up the prisoners, and vice versa. If neither chooses to blow up the other, both will be blown up by the Joker.\nIntuitively, we\u2019d think that the civilians are justified, even obligated, to blow up the other ship (if Batman hadn\u2019t intervened.) Of course, the simplest justification here is that it\u2019s the utilitarian thing to do. Furthermore, it just seems right that the outlaws of society deserve their punishment, i.e., their death.\nBut there\u2019s another way to explain these discriminatory instincts towards these hypothetical criminals. It also explains why some of us have prejudicial intuitions against the unvaccinated. (Well, at least, I do.)\nThat idea is the sense of a \u201cmoral high ground.\u201d It\u2019s a term that I\u2019d use to describe that sense of moral superiority over other people. We feel that we have some \u201chigher\u201d or \u201cexclusive\u201d sense of morality that we think others lack.\nA crude example of this is when I visit ill-treated public toilets. You know, the kind where piss sticks around the toilet seat or the kind where the previous user didn\u2019t bother to flush down his chocolate mousse. The immediate feeling of, \u201cWhoever did this is one son of a bitch!\u201d That which often accompanies some form of moral judgment.\nSurely, if it were me, I wouldn\u2019t have been so inconsiderate and disgusting! Whoever did this deserves some retribution!\nIt\u2019s a feeling that we all have (whether we\u2019d like to admit it or not). Yes, it\u2019s a form of hatred and prejudice. But they\u2019re a very specific kind: they carry moral weight. In some sense, we also believe that we should be protected from feeling such hatred and prejudice.\nMany crimes naturally incite such feelings. Rape and murder naturally cause the victims resentment. So, we expect laws to protect us from these horrendous acts. In other words, we translate that hate and prejudice into implicit moral codes, which are then sanctified by the laws of society.\nNow, if all this is beginning to sound like how vaccination mandates are today, that\u2019s because it\u2019s really not much different.\nToday, those vaccinated somehow possess a moral high ground over the unvaccinated. I\u2019m traveling to the UK in a few weeks (bad timing, I know), and vaccinated travelers don\u2019t need to serve an arranged quarantine. Unvaccinated ones need to be isolated for 10 days.\nIn Malaysia and Singapore, unvaccinated citizens can\u2019t access public places. That includes the mall, markets, restaurants, etc. Of course, our government believes that this differentiation protects the vulnerable groups of our society. And I\u2019d like to believe that.\nBut such a measure will inevitably create some unbalanced power relationship between the vaccinated and unvaccinated. Gradually, it takes on a moral import.\nTo draw a parallel, I haven\u2019t committed any crimes, so I get to move around society. If I had committed a crime, I\u2019d need to serve years of state-mandated quarantine. Well, the difference between this quarantine and the abovementioned is that we have a name for this: it\u2019s called imprisonment.\nWe don\u2019t need Foucault to tell us how similar these scenarios are. If you\u2019ve been in quarantine, you\u2019d know exactly how it feels. Sure, the accommodation and hospitality you receive in quarantine is infinitely better than in prison. Other than that, quarantine is just a fancy prison for the suspected.\nWhen there are imbalances in our sense of power and morality, there\u2019s surely going to be hubris. The sense of possessing the moral high ground: I\u2019m vaccinated. So, I\u2019m a responsible citizen who\u2019s done my part in this pandemic. Now, I deserve the \u201cmerits\u201d of being vaccinated.\nIt\u2019s this inconspicuous hubris that fuels the power divide between the vaccinated and unvaccinated.\nThe Vaccination Hubris\nI don\u2019t know about the rest of the world, but there was a trend in Malaysia and Singapore for people to pose their \u201cI\u2019m vaccinated\u201d photos on social media. Even my favorite artist JJ Lin posted both his shots on Instagram a day after I got mine. Needless to say that my parents and many of my friends did the same as well.\nIn short, there\u2019s some sense of pride, bordering on hubris, when it comes to being vaccinated here. Though I\u2019m fortunately unaware of any prevailing prejudices against the unvaccinated here (because everyone I know is vaccinated,) it\u2019s difficult for me to say that there\u2019s no prejudice at all.\nDespite my lack of exposure to such prejudices, Carlos Garbiras brought it to my attention that such discriminatory predilections exist elsewhere. And what he described \u2014 at least to me \u2014 seems to be a form of hubris amongst the vaccinated that culminated into a form of prejudice.\nHonestly, it sounds very stupid for anyone to have such pride in being vaccinated insofar as they\u2019re willing to mock the unvaccinated. Think of the sore winner whose victory is insufficient insofar as he needs to rub salt into his opponent\u2019s wound. Even if there\u2019s anything \u201cvictorious\u201d about being vaccinated, it\u2019s childish at best.\nWhen I first read Carlos\u2019s essay, I thought, \u201cTo hell with those unvaccinated. It\u2019s their choice not to get jabbed. They deserve what comes to them.\u201d\nSure, I still think that if it comes down to the wire, we shouldn\u2019t direct any more resources to the unvaccinated. Yes, if someone didn\u2019t get vaccinated when they could and ended up suffering the consequences, I fully advocate letting them die. And in many ways, we\u2019re obligated to discriminate against the unvaccinated.\nIf my child were a 12-year-old who couldn\u2019t get vaccinated, I wouldn\u2019t have let her party with a bunch of adults. I have a moral obligation to discriminate against her, stopping her from participating in activities that would put her and her family in harm's way.\nNow, it\u2019s a separate issue when it comes to \u201cbullying\u201d someone who\u2019s unvaccinated. It\u2019s one thing to discriminate against the unvaccinated and another to plug our eyes when they try to tell us why they\u2019re not vaccinated.\nAs a philosopher, I\u2019m all for hearing ideas, regardless of how stupid they are. But I also understand that it only takes a speck of hubris for anyone to plug their ears against opposing ideas.\nThe Silencing Effect Of Hubris\nI\u2019ve published many essays addressing the phenomenon of \u201cmoral sanctuary.\u201d (See here and here.) It\u2019s the idea that certain social activities and attitudes are immune to moral evaluation because of their overwhelming sense of normality. In other words, we will intuitively dismiss ethical evaluations of things we find normal.\nNo one ponders if it\u2019s really fair for everyone to queue up regardless of how many items they\u2019re purchasing. No one also really ponders if getting paid 14% of a business with virtually zero overhead cost is fair. And not too long ago, no one really pondered if mass-murdering an entire race is morally right.\nObviously, being vaccinated is the new norm. Not being vaccinated makes you an outcast. So, when the outcast speaks, people don\u2019t want to hear it. We ask them to shut up. Sometimes, very politely with a \u201cyou can\u2019t think of it this way.\u201d\nOne could think of \u201cmoral sanctuary\u201d as a socially sanctioned censorship. No one stops you from talking about it. But ironically, you feel like it\u2019s wrong to say it.\nAs a philosopher, I have a duty to hear out the outcast. Heck, I\u2019m the outcast most of the time. So, here\u2019s my view: \u201cLet the unvaccinated die. But until they do, hear them out. Yes, they might be stupid. But, hey, they\u2019re going to die anyway. So will you and I.\u201d\nThanks, Carlos Garbiras for tagging me in the prompt and acknowledging me as a philosopher (though I\u2019m still halfway through my degree, no thanks to covid.)

It doesn\u2019t take long for you to reach another vehicle driving at the same speed as the vehicles on the left. You flashed your headlights, put on your signals, and still that god-damn vehicle doesn\u2019t move.\nDeep down, you wonder how the hell the driver got their driver\u2019s license. But at the same time, you\u2019re pretty sure that whoever they are, though their horrible pricks who shouldn\u2019t be driving, they\u2019re not a criminal.\nWhat I\u2019m describing here is a form of moral discrepancy. Most of us aren\u2019t criminals. But we\u2019re total jackasses: we litter inconsiderably, park our cars horribly while taking up two spaces instead of one, smoke in non-smoking areas, and cut queues.\nInterestingly, this \u201cdiscrepancy\u201d is relatable to myths about the afterlife. Murderers and rapists get sent to hell. Saints who spent their entire life helping starving children get sent to heaven.\nBut what about the rest?\nPeople who litter and clog up the fast lane don\u2019t seem to belong in hell. They\u2019re jerks, but surely their deeds don\u2019t qualify as cardinal sins. What about the people who don\u2019t litter? Surely, they\u2019re not saintly enough to be sent to heaven?\nHerein lies the discrepancy. But there\u2019s an interesting and profound sociological explanation to this. Here, I\u2019ll attempt to answer the question: Why are we not criminals but total pricks?\nHell Is Rated \u201cU\u201d\nWhen I was a kid (I can\u2019t remember how old,) my parents brought me along their trip to Hell. That Hell was and still is, situated in Singapore\u2019s Haw Par Villa that now offers air-conditioning and a place to dine-in if anyone still has the appetite for Singaporean Chinese cuisine after sighting-seeing scenes of torture. (Because, as Uncle Roger would say, the secret to great egg-fried rice is torture.)\nIt\u2019s ironic if you think about it: a country so heavily invested in censorship turns a museum filled with depictions of naked bodies (male and female)being bloodily tortured into a tourist attraction. While they don\u2019t recommend children under 9 to enter Hell, kids under 6 get free admission. It turns out Hell is rated \u201cU\u201d \u2014 suitable for all ages. (One\u2019s never too young to be mentally traumatized.)\nI digress. I still remember the disturbing images of Hell being etched onto my mind. I also remembered having nightmares that night. I believe I\u2019m not the only Chinese kid whose parents used images like these to \u201ceducate\u201d their children about moral life.\nI\u2019m quite certain that I wasn\u2019t the only one being told, \u201cThis is what happens to people who tell lies,\u201d while seeing a sculpture of a person whose tongue is being bloodily ripped out by some half-naked demons.\nSince young, I\u2019ve been \u201ceducated\u201d about divine justice. \u201cThe sky has an eye,\u201d my parents used to say. I\u2019ve been told that doing evil in this life will land me a ticket to the depths of hell, and if I do good, I\u2019ll go to heaven where all the goodies are.\nInterestingly, every culture has its conception of the afterlife. Images of hell and heaven aren\u2019t necessarily tied to any religious beliefs. But religions do have significant influences on said images. So, while Buddhism doesn\u2019t offer any lucid description of what Hell looks like, somehow Buddhas are seen in hell.\nNevertheless, the fact that images of heaven and hell persist in so many cultures points to one thing: that societies have effectively used their imaginations to exert moral authority over individuals. How do they do so? By perpetuating a myth of fear and desire. Precisely, these mythical inventions use our fear of the threat of violence and our desire for pleasure as leverages to control our behaviors.\nThat\u2019s why Hell is rated \u201cU.\u201d It\u2019s never too early to exercise power over young minds.\nOn The Fear Of The Threat Of Violence\nI had an interesting conversation with my brother the other day. We were sitting in a cafe, looking at the empty parking spot next to the cafe. It was a busy weekday afternoon, and cars were double-parking. Yet, this one spot was deliberately left empty.\nIf you haven\u2019t guessed it, it was a \u201creserved\u201d parking spot for PWDs.\nIt\u2019s an interesting phenomenon if you think about it. In Singapore, trains and busses have similar spots \u201creserved\u201d for the elderly, pregnant women, and PWDs. The train could be packed up till the doors, and these sites will be left miraculously empty.\nTo clarify, these spots aren\u2019t really reserved in the sense that someone has already claimed that spot. If anyone took up those spots, no one would blame you for being an irresponsible prick. But why do we not take up those spots?\nWhen asked, most of us would say, \u201cWell, we never know when someone needs it. So we better leave it as it is.\u201d\nWhile charitable, this isn\u2019t the real reason we, as a society, deliberately leave these \u201creserved\u201d spots empty. The deeper sociological explanation is that we fear violence. It\u2019s not just violence but also the threat of violence. It\u2019s the idea that someone, somehow, will show up and literally beat us up. This need not actually happen. We need only imagine that plausibility. And that\u2019s enough for us to be scared.\nSo, while we would say, \u201cWell, we never know when someone needs it,\u201d what we really mean is, \u201cWell, we never know when someone would show up and beat the crap out of me, so I better leave it as it is.\u201d\nThis is also why we pay our bills and taxes, go to work punctually, and, in general, not be total pricks. Because we know, subconsciously, that \u201cmisbehaving\u201d would somehow result in us getting hurt (i.e., subjected to violence.)\nMost, if not some, of our social awareness and responsibilities, are motivated by our fear of the threat of violence. While I don\u2019t deny altruistic motivations, I\u2019d wager most of us choose not to be pricks because we genuinely fear being beaten up.\nOn Desiring Pleasure\nWe avert actions and behaviors that might end up physically hurting us. The converse is also true; we\u2019re motivated by pleasure (something as simple as genuine praises.)\nThat\u2019s why myths about heaven often accompany myths about hell. Because while we\u2019re told what not to do, we also need to know what to do.\nIn many cultures, however implausible, the promise of heaven is a powerful motivation for people to lead moral lives. My personal experiences with Christians demonstrate this power. Though most of them, I must admit, are dumb, very few of them are pricks.\nIs Fear The Proper Motivation For Moral Behavior?\nOne of the earliest philosophical discourses on this issue is held between two famous Confucian philosophers Mengzi and Xunzi.\nMengzi believed that humans have the innate capacity to do good and that our moral motivation stems from our moral emotions, such as sympathy. Xunzi believed that such emotions are unreliable and that one ought to resort to rituals and proprieties to coerce society into behaving morally.\nWhile most modern scholars dismissed Xunzi\u2019s philosophy for historical reasons (his philosophy motivated the tyrannical rule of Qin), they are unaware of how Xunzi\u2019s philosophy has described much of our moral behavior: it\u2019s largely motivated by coercion.\nWhen asked, I\u2019d wager that most of us would say that fear is not the proper motivation for moral behavior. We\u2019d intuitively say that we should be moral because we desire good things (or something to that extent.) Morality shouldn\u2019t be built on fear.\nThat\u2019s reasonable. Insofar as we want others and ourselves to behave morally, we don\u2019t want to do so under the false impression that we\u2019re merely avoiding trouble. Similarly, we don\u2019t want to say, \u201cI\u2019ll do good so I can go to heaven later.\u201d\nWhile there\u2019s nothing much wrong practically, we want our ethical lives to be less naive. We want our moral lives to be more meaningful.\nIn contemporary life, society has set up many institutions to instate and regulate sociological fear of violence: we\u2019ve set up law enforcement, courts, and prisons, etc. These institutions and systems are very effective in controlling our behaviors.\nWhen we\u2019re deciding if we should steal, there\u2019s always the threat that someone will catch us in action and beat us up. We pay our bills and not run away after a meal because there\u2019s always the possibility that someone will catch up to us and beat us up. We park within parking lines, drive within lanes, report to work punctually, all because we fear getting (physically) hurt.\nSimilar institutions have been set up long before our time. To instill that fear, one doesn\u2019t need prisons, webcams, or security personnel. One needs only a compelling narrative that scares people into behaving well their entire life. And what better myth to perpetuate than a myth of the most extreme violence anyone could imagine?\nThis is perhaps why images and narratives of the afterlife are so prominent in many cultures: they\u2019re perhaps the best means to instill our natural fear and aversion towards violence.\nA Pandemic Of Moral Ignorance\nIf the people be led by laws, and uniformity sought to be given them by punishments, they will try to avoid the punishment but have no sense of shame. If they be led by true virtue, and uniformity sought to be given them by the rules of propriety, they will have the sense of shame, and moreover will become good. \u2014 The Confucian Analects, Book II\nI am convinced that people today conceptualize moral behavior as a means to escape the threat of violence. People usually pay their bills and do not run away because they fear getting hurt. Even if the waiter doesn\u2019t bring the bill to us, we\u2019d quite naturally pay before leaving. In other words, people are quite punctual in paying up for things.\nBut when it comes to an informal meeting, people are often despicably late. Somehow being conscious of punctuality only applies to events that matter to people. In other words, we\u2019re not punctual when there\u2019s no threat of violence.\nThis is a general observation of the \u201cmoral discrepancy\u201d most society has: most of us aren\u2019t criminals, but we\u2019re pricks most of the time.\nIn other words, we\u2019re doing the minimum of what morality demands. We behave well enough not to get ourselves arrested, and we\u2019re total jackasses for what remains.\nI see this as a failure of our moral education. As a society, we\u2019re conditioned to behave morally with the fear of the threat of violence. Since young, many of us are taught that moral behavior is merely \u201cfollowing the law.\u201d\nWe avert hell (the threat of violence) as much as we desire heaven (pleasure.) Yet, contemporary society only leverages \u201chell.\u201d In other words, we\u2019re very efficient in reducing criminals but doing a very bad job at reducing pricks. We invest billions in deterrence, yet nothing on encouraging moral behavior.\nSure, we\u2019re taught about compassion and sympathy. But our entire society is structured with a narrative of hell: we don\u2019t encourage genuinely moral behavior but merely punish criminal acts.\nFinally, I\u2019ve assumed that \u201cnot stealing\u201d is as moral as an act as \u201cbeing punctual.\u201d I\u2019ve also assumed that mundane acts such as cleaning up the toilet seat if you\u2019ve \u201cmissed\u201d as moral acts. In other words, \u201cnot being a criminal\u201d is as much a moral consideration as \u201cnot being a total jackass.\u201d\nBecause if anything\u2019s clear here, we might be living a fairly safe society where criminals don\u2019t roam the streets, but we\u2019re certainly living in one that\u2019s filled with total jerks and pricks. We might even be one \u2014 hopefully unconsciously.\nSo, if we want to fix this pandemic of moral ignorance, we could either beat up the people who are total pricks. Or, less violently, reward those who\u2019re genuinely behaving morally.", "comment_count": 5, "like_count": 333, "created_time": 1638928956761, "comment": [{"user_id": "46a88d5008a8", "comment_time": 1638928956761, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "144a76f86fa8", "comment_time": 1639416870855, "comment": "Moral behavior is continuously rewarded informally.

I thought to myself, \u201cOh, boy. Not again.\u201d\nI barely recovered from the Jessica Krug aka Jessica La Bombalera debacle. A student by the name of Mackenzie Fierceton, from the University of Pennsylvania, had her Rhodes Scholarship revoked and the degrees she earned were rescinded. Her crime? According to her alma mater, lying about being low-income, growing up in foster care, and being a first-generation student.\nI found this particularly triggering as I spent almost nine years of my childhood in foster care and the trauma I experienced made it life-debilitating as an adult. Luckily, I found a backdoor into Columbia University, as a nontraditional student. The School of General Studies required a detailed autobiographical essay. It was a grueling endeavor as I had to lay my trauma bare. I described the severe abuse I experienced in foster care, witnessing the attempted murder of an overnight staff at a residential treatment center I lived in, and so much more that happened to me as I grew older. When I was finally accepted, I was overcome with extreme happiness. My Ivy League journey sadly didn\u2019t live up to my expectations, but that's a saga to be told at another time.\nI read a few articles written about Mackenzie Fierceton. In an article published in November 2020, by The Philadelphia Inquirer, the headline states that she aged out of foster care. Further, it was written that she grew up poor and \u201ccycled through the rocky child welfare system\u201d. She was quoted saying, \u201cAt my school, everyone kind of knew me as like the foster kid who all these bad things had happened to.\u201d\nThe fact is that Fierceton spent her senior year in the foster care system, after being removed from her mother\u2019s care. There were allegations of abuse and people in her life were able to corroborate these claims. Her mother, Carrie Morrison, is a well-respected figure in the medical community. She was able to provide her daughter with private school education, a home in an affluent suburb, and other enriching activities a low-income foster child wouldn\u2019t have the opportunity to experience.\nChild abuse certainly doesn\u2019t only happen in the shadowy margins of society but it also occurs in households of societal respectability. Thankfully, Fierceton was removed and her claims were taken seriously despite the standing her mother had with their community. My concerns aren\u2019t focused on the perceived validity of the abuse allegations, but on the fact, she co-opted a narrative that wasn\u2019t hers. Should her childhood abuse be called into question because she grew up privileged? No, it shouldn\u2019t. However, she didn\u2019t see it necessary to iron out any kinks in her trauma narrative.\nChecking Off A Box\nAs mentioned, I\u2019m a former foster care youth, but I also identified as low-income. I called one of the poorest zip codes in New York City home, and my life experiences were spawned from such a reality. I don\u2019t identify as a first-generation college student because I have many college-educated family members \u2014 including both of my parents. My mother was born into Irish American Aristocracy. My great-great-grandfather was Thomas E. Murray, whose innovative genius allowed him to infiltrate a non-Catholic, predominately Protestant, New York Society.\nLike Mackenzie Fierceton, my mother had a privileged childhood but secretly lived in an abusive household. My grandmother \u2014 her mother \u2014 psychologically abused her. My grandmother was a celebrated socialite who dated Errol Flynn. Who would believe someone like her was an abusive mother? As a result of this, my mother suffered from severe depression and anxiety. This caused her downward mobility and eventual familial alienation. That\u2019s how I ended up with the childhood I did. As tragic as it was, I still wouldn't qualify as a first-generation student.\nFor the sake of transparency, I succinctly revealed my family lineage in my autographical essay for my Columbia University application. I checked off boxes truthfully. I met other students who were a part of the FGLI \u2014 First-Generation Low-Income \u2014 demographic. Often they assumed I was first-generation, and I corrected the mistake every time. I\u2019m very mindful of not taking up space or centering myself in lived experiences or identities that aren\u2019t mine to claim.\nLiterary Contortion\nvia Charuna.net\nA few months went by as the scandal appeared to have died down, The New Yorker published a lengthy article. While one should appreciate how it detailed the horrific physical abuse Mackenzie Fierceton endured from her mother and sexual abuse at the hands of her mother\u2019s boyfriend, I couldn\u2019t help but notice the desperate attempts to downplay the fact she co-opted marginalized identities that weren\u2019t hers, to begin with.\nThe article briefly mentioned the suspicious timing of the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s investigation into her past. Fierceton was a witness in a wrongful death lawsuit of a fellow student. I do have to admit the timing is suspicious. She displayed moral righteousness to help another student\u2019s family get answers and/or justice for a loved one who\u2019s no longer alive to defend himself. I was left disturbed to read that the University of Pennsylvania contacted Mackenzie Fierceton\u2019s mother \u2014 her abuser \u2014 to be a part of the investigation into her daughter. I do also have to admit, whether the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s motives were retaliatory or not, it exposed that her trauma narrative was riddled with embellishments.\nWhen interviewed for The Philadelphia Inquirer, she claimed she was known as the \u201cfoster kid\u201d at her school. Upon reading The New Yorker article, I concluded she was known as the private school girl with mysterious injuries. Many of her friends, their parents, and school faculty, supported her claims of abuse. Her school was kind enough to allow her to finish her education as a scholarship student.\nI found the tweaking of what defines a person as \u201clow-income\u201d or \u201cfirst-generation\u201d as an attempt to downplay Fierceton\u2019s embellishments, very problematic. She did the tweaking along with her supporters. She insinuated that since she was in foster care, she belonged to \u201cthe state\u201d. Mackenzie Fierceton wasn\u2019t a ward of the state to my knowledge, and her mother didn\u2019t sign her parental rights away. She emotionally and from a \u201clegal\u201d standpoint felt like she didn\u2019t have a family, so she was a \u201cfirst-generation\u201d student. She wasn\u2019t supported by her mother\u2019s high income during her last year in high school, so she was \u201clow-income\u201d.\nMackenzie Fierceton and her supporters utilize the word \u201cnuance\u201d to describe the act of not correcting assumptions about her background. I feel she had many opportunities to set the record straight, but according to her she was too intimidated to assert herself to make necessary corrections. Navigating university life without familial or community support was a real thing she struggled with upon her admittance. Unfortunately, withholding details of her unique life experience or letting people run with a narrative that wasn\u2019t her lived experience, could be perceived as an act of deceit.\n\u201cWhen you are in foster care, your legal guardian is the state,\u201d Mackenzie responded, according to the reconstruction. \u201cI was considered the only generation at this point.\u201d She went on, \u201cI legally did not have parents and never considered them as such to begin with.\u201d \u2014 Mackenzie Fierceton for The New Yorker\nFierceton claimed she was embarrassed about her time in foster care. I believe her because as an adult I buried the trauma foster care caused me for many years. I was afraid people wouldn\u2019t understand or assumed my mother was neglectful or abusive. It was the opposite as I remember her being very intuitive of my emotional well-being and showering me with love. We were a poor white family living in a mostly Black low-income apartment complex in The Bronx, and our school railroaded my mother with trumped-up child neglect allegations. For Mackenzie Fierceton\u2019s source of embarrassment, I can\u2019t comment on it because that\u2019s her lived experience.\nTo circle back on my uneasiness with tweaking the meaning of \u201clow-income\u201d and \u201cfirst-generation\u201d, to me \u201clow-income\u201d means growing up in a household with an annual income that would constitute \u201clow-income\u201d, and \u201cfirst-generation\u201d is a person who\u2019s the first in the family to go to college. Mackenzie Fierceton benefitted from her abusive mother\u2019s high income for most of her life and she wasn\u2019t the first person in her family to attend college.\nFierceton was technically a foster care youth who aged out; it was because of the timing of her entry into the foster care system. She led the public to believe she was raised by the foster care system and endured many foster care placements. She co-opted a narrative that wasn\u2019t her lived experience. The average foster care youth who ages out ends up with dangerous and/or fatal life outcomes. They rarely find their way into an Ivy League university.\nWhat About The Poor Kids?\nvia: kuow.org\nThe commentary in reaction to The New Yorker article and statements made by the peers of Mackenzie Fierceton at the University of Pennsylvania was extremely demeaning to FGLI students who grew up in poverty and went to inner-city public school.\nFierceton\u2019s FGLI ally and supporter, Anea Moore, wrote a letter on her behalf to the Rhodes Trust. Moore is a founding member of Penn First and welcomed Fierceton into the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s FGLI fold. I thought the statement she provided for the article to be a perpetuation of respectability politics, elitism, and shame of students who came from poverty and failing public schools. Members who are born into respectable society or manage to infiltrate it, can\u2019t help themselves to create a spectrum of importance and/or prestige when categorizing others.\n\u201cWhen I founded Penn First, it was for students just like her, and her membership and leadership in the club was welcomed with open arms,\u201d she explained. \u201cFGLI kids can go to private school and/or college preparatory school just as Mackenzie did. We are not all inner-city children who live in filthy ghettos and attend crumbling, rat-infested public schools as the wider media may portray us to be.\u201d \u2014 Anea Moore supporter and fellow FGLI peer at the University of Pennsylvania\nOn Twitter, people are clamoring around Mackenzie Fierceton supportively since the publication. Their opinions or reactionary feelings they have after reading the article are at the expense of low-income students/people, or those who grew up in an impoverished environment. In the article, supporters claim that Fierceton is being punished because she wasn\u2019t \u201cpoor for long enough\u201d, or making statements that signal she\u2019s \u201cnot like other foster care youth\u201d. Throughout her presence in higher education, she played the \u201clow-income\u201d card\u2014a card that she seemingly stole from someone else\u2019s deck.\nThe card served its purpose, so it\u2019s back to respectability. Fierceton\u2019s abusive homelife impacted her mental health. She suffered trauma. Being removed from a life she knew well and entering foster care, was a disruption for sure. Despite all of that, she was socialized as a woman of respectability for most of her life. She\u2019s well-spoken and had the resources to mold herself into a stunning poster child of resiliency in foster care.\nMackenzie Fierceton\u2019s narrative was weaved into a tragic tale of abuse and poverty, but she was The American Dream personified. This is what most likely impressed the University of Pennsylvania. Despite what they assumed about her tragic tale, she was the girl next door. Her blonde hair, well-manicured appearance, and distinctive smile made her a more appealing foster care statistic. This is why the blue-checked Twitter accounts of respectable society are staunchly standing by Fierceton while exposing their elitist mentality along the way, like a Stanford University professor implied that this situation manifested because \u201cPenn\u201d is one of the \u201cshitty lesser Ivies\u201d.\n\nWhat To Make of All This?\n\nHopefully, after reading my perceptions of the public discourse surrounding Mackenzie Fierceton, a person would be able to comprehend that I acknowledge the abuse she faced and didn\u2019t allow her privileged upbringing to cast any doubts. I know some people did just that when the story first broke months ago. I felt adding my familial history as context, would emphasize I don\u2019t allow stereotypes on what abusers look like or where people believe it happens, to muddle the conclusion I arrive at.\nIf Mackenzie Fierceton provided details of her narrative truthfully, she could\u2019ve shattered the misconception that abuse only happens in marginalized households. Moreover, she could\u2019ve used her story to encourage other abused minors in high-income or privileged households that there\u2019s a way out.\nThe callous way the University of Pennsylvania acted while investigating Fierceton\u2019s background invalidated the abuse she endured. I want to reiterate that I do find the timing of the investigation suspicious. My views on this situation may appear to be contradictory, but they\u2019re not. Life isn\u2019t black or white, there\u2019s room for grey areas. While I acknowledge that she\u2019s an abuse survivor and experienced trauma, I can\u2019t allow that to excuse her deception.\nShe centered herself in a narrative that wasn\u2019t her lived experience. The human experience isn\u2019t one size, fits all. We all have a story to tell or obstacles we had to overcome. There\u2019s a problem in the academic realm with people co-opting someone else\u2019s lived experience for the means of social capital. This is why when the story first broke I sighed out loud. Indeed, there was so much left out of Mackenzie Fierceton\u2019s story when she first became scrutinized, but the fact remains, she embellished aspects of her lived experience. Definitions were tweaked to make it appear she didn\u2019t.\nI want to dedicate my response to The New Yorker article and the situation as a whole, to Ma\u2019Khia Bryant. She was a Black foster care youth, gunned down by the Columbus Police Department. She was failed by so many people and the entities who employ them. The police officer who shot her was exonerated in March 2022. For some reason, I thought of her throughout this writing exercise.\nmakhia Bryant tiktok\nFOLLOW ME ON TIKTOK: JARRED333 SEND PAYPAL DONATIONS TO https://paypal.me/pools/c/8hVDuBITW6BECOME A PATREON MEMBER\u2026youtube.com", "comment_count": 1, "like_count": 181, "created_time": 1648649518824, "comment": [{"user_id": "388380f36545", "comment_time": 1648649518824, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "e3b3c83841e6", "comment_time": 1649138454824, "comment": "I think part of the problem is that scholarships and university admissions try to condense the infinite diversity of the human experience into \"narratives\"."}], "post_tag": ["Education", "Mental Health", "Social Media", "Equality", "Academia"]}, {"author": "Chantal", "post_id": "ee9280656481", "user_id": "388380f36545", "title": "Those Who Laugh Last Gets The Last Laugh", "content": "Those Who Laugh Last Gets The Last Laugh\nThe methodical character assassination of The People\u2019s Princess\n(Princess Diana at a cancer hospital in Lahore, 1996) credit: John Giles/Pool\nA Royal Disaster\nThe past four years the British Royal Family found themselves embroiled in one scandal after another. Meghan, The Duchess of Sussex, signaled that this over thousand-year-old institution was heading towards modernity, as she\u2019s a biracial woman who married Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex. The world became aware of the unpleasantries she and her husband had to endure, as she laid it all bare during a sit-down interview with Oprah.\nAs this was unfolding, the palace worked overtime to downplay Prince Andrew\u2019s connection to Jeffrey Epstein and to extinguish allegations made by Virginia Roberts Giuffre. He eventually settled out of court, when the matter was set to go to trial. The Queen\u2019s supposed favorite son was stripped of military titles and was taken off royal duty, but is still technically a prince.\nAt the end of 2021, Prince William became a trending topic on Twitter over allegedly cheating on his wife with Rose Hanbury. One Meghan Markle fan account went as far as to claim Kensington Palace colluded with tabloids to paint the Duke and Duchess of Sussex in a negative light, to take the focus off the cheating rumors. The bad times continued to roll, as it was announced that the police are launching an investigation into Prince Charles\u2019s charity, as relevant documents were unearthed that showed \u201ccash for honors\u201d took place. As to be expected, he vehemently denies any knowledge of this.\nThere seems to be a concentration of bad luck within the House of Windsor. Is it truly bad luck, or an arrival of a karmic consequence? Diana, Princess of Wales died over twenty years ago. She\u2019s undisputedly one of the most iconic women of the twentieth century. Her style, approach, and genuineness captivated the world. She angered the family she married into as their popularity paled in comparison to hers. In 1996, she lost her HRH status, but her adoring public still refers to her as Princess Diana.\nDecades forged on, and now and then, the parties who wronged Princess Diana attempt to tweak history by reframing events that portray her as paranoid, or situational occurrences being complicated misunderstandings due to her so-called \u201cmental illness\u201d. Princess Diana blew the whistle about Prince Charles and Camilla Parker-Bowles, in the early 1990s when she collaborated with Andrew Morton for Diana: Her True Story. The book also revealed how calculating and alienating royal life could be.\nWas she a victim of an antiquated institution that used her as a pawn? Or a crafty public figure who used her visibility and access to the press to her advantage? With The People\u2019s Princess not around to defend herself, let this be an exercise of weaving a tapestry using published works, firsthand accounts from the woman herself, and video evidence that will undo misconceptions.\nThe Matchmaking Grandmother\nPrincess Diana\u2019s maternal grandmother, Baroness Fermoy, was considered an important member of the Queen Mother\u2019s inner circle. It was widely believed that these two grandmothers of the Prince and Princess of Wales, utilized their teatime to plot a match between their grandchildren. There were conversations about the suitability of a young Lady Diana, but it was the Queen Mother who was keen on the idea of her marrying into the family. There were accounts of Baroness Fermoy privately advising her granddaughter against it, and another narrative that she was too timid to vocalize objections to the Queen Mother. Baroness Fermoy\u2019s sense of duty to the royal family was ultimately at the expense of her granddaughter.\nThe engagement announcement was during a time of racial tension and political unrest. An anti-royalist politician went far as to accuse the British Establishment of using the engagement and eventual marriage to take the focus of the stark inequality that was rampant in Great Britain. It worked as \u201cDi Mania\u201d ensued. People around the world wanted to know everything about her and women aspired to be like her. Formal royal correspondent, Stephen Baker, analyzed that the royal family saw Princess Diana as a \u201cbreath of fresh air, who could revitalize their image\u201d.\n(Princess Diana outside her London apartment, 1980) credit: Tatler\nA nineteen-year-old Princess Diana could hardly believe that the World\u2019s Most Eligible Bachelor chose her to be his bride. Before her engagement to Prince Charles, she lived in an apartment with her friends in a fashionable district in London. Princess Diana worked numerous jobs such as a nanny, kindergarten teaching assistant, and cleaning her older sister\u2019s residence. Her life transformed overnight. She was quoted saying, \u201cI didn\u2019t have any idea what I let myself in for. One day, I was going to work on the Number 9 bus, and the next, I was a princess.\u201d\nBefore her wedding, she expressed concern if marrying Prince Charles was the right decision. She felt she didn\u2019t have time to get to know her soon-to-be husband and she was being \u201cpushed\u201d into things. When Camilla Parker-Bowles entered the picture, it became a snafu-riddled ordeal. The two women had lunch together and were photographed at a horse race in 1980. During the lunch, Princess Diana became suspicious in the questions she asked, as she later realized she was strategizing how to carry on her relationship with Prince Charles. She found a bracelet engraved with pet names Prince Charles and Camilla Parker-Bowles gave one another. She was rightfully fed up and wanted out. She was told by her older sisters it was \u201ctoo late\u201d.\n(Princess Diana and Camilla Parker-Bowles at a horse race, 1980) credit: Harpers Bazaar\nHer marital doubts during her engagement were public knowledge since the release of Diana: Her True Story. It\u2019s rather peculiar that back in 2015, an alleged Prince Charles \u201cinsider\u201d revealed to Catherine Mayer, who published the unauthorized biography Charles: Heart of a King, claimed that Prince Charles almost jilted Princess Diana at the alter. Her \u201ccomplex personality\u201d and her bulimia were too much of a shock for him.\nAccording to Diana: Her True Story, her bulimia began a week after her engagement announcement because Prince Charles commented on her weight. To speak on defining her personality as \u201ccomplex\u201d, Princess Diana became an instant public figure and had to face the reality of sharing her future husband with another woman. These were stressful situations. One must ask themselves, what does this new perspective achieve and who does it benefit if people believe it to be true?\nJealousy is a Green-Eyed Monster\ncredit: Jayne Fincher/Getty Images\nPrincess Diana quickly became the most popular member of the British Royal Family. Her husband was the future King of England, but people lined the streets in droves to see her. Her popularity was political and cultural dynamite \u2014 it was a public relations success. The British Royal Family felt jealous of her popularity. For example, in 1984, Princess Diana was accused of trying to upstage Queen Elizabeth during the ceremonial opening of Parliament when she changed her hairstyle. Princess Diana made the heartbreaking claim that Prince Charles treated her horribly due to jealousy.\nAs mentioned before, royal experts theorized that the British Royal Family brought Princess Diana into the fold to rebrand themselves, but expressed disdain towards her when she commanded attention. Her life became an environment where hostility and unpredictability manifested. Living this way had a serious impact on her mental health.\nShe became a prisoner in a gilded cage, as it became undeniable she was in a loveless marriage. Everyone seemed to be aware of the business-like agreement of the marriage \u2014 even her husband. Prince Charles married for duty, not for love. His heart was with Camilla Parker-Bowles. She went to Queen Elizabeth to get help about the cancerous presence Camilla Parker-Bowles had in her life and marriage. The Queen had a cold demeanor and showed no compassion towards her dire situation. Princess Diana felt further alienated and went deeper into despair. To make matters bleaker for The People\u2019s Princess, the Queen Mother sided with Prince Charles and expressed severe displeasure towards her. The Queen Mother\u2019s estate was also one of the venues, where Prince Charles and Camilla Parker-Bowles carried out their affair.\nPrincess Diana was unfairly described as mentally unstable because she stood up against the maltreatment her husband inflicted on her. She wasn\u2019t paranoid nor did she lash out at those around her unprovoked. Dealing with an onslaught of maltreatment and not being validated, was her day-to-day reality. Even though Princess Diana was beloved on a global scale, she was still considered an outsider who married into the British Royal Family.\nDespite Prince Charles acting cruelly towards his wife, the family closed ranks. Queen Elizabeth was rumored to have said that Princess Diana\u2019s bulimia was the cause of the marital breakdown. Princess Diana\u2019s treatment had characteristics of mental abuse. She wanted her husband to stop cheating on her; a situation he completely manufactured. He was the source of the problem, but Princess Diana was penalized for speaking about it.\nThe Secret is Out\n(Princess Diana visits a daycare center in New York City, 1989) credit: Allan Tannenbaum/Getty Images\nAs a way of coping with her life, she leaned into her public appearances and charitable endeavors. Her celebrity brought attention to worthy causes. As a schoolgirl, Princess Diana spent weekends volunteering for the elderly and mentally disabled. Being of service to others was ingrained before royal life.\nThe early 1990s was a gamechanger for Princess Diana, as she decided to secretly collaborate with Andrew Morton for Diana: Her True Story. The claims were Earth-shattering. According to Princess Diana, Prince Charles and Camilla Parker-Bowles would maliciously taunt her behind her back and their inner circle participated in whisper campaigns about her. Before the bombshell book hit the shelves, Andrew Morton claimed that his office was mysteriously broken into. Princess Diana worried that the palace knew what they were doing, and she had her sitting room swept for bugs, as this was the place she conducted interviews for the book.\nThe streaming platform Peacock released a documentary about Princess Diana in 2021. A participant of the documentary stated that her collaboration with Andrew Morton was a preemptive move. She had reason to believe that the royal family would take her children away from her. Her mother, Francis Shand Kydd, lost custody of her children and her family members testified against her. She didn\u2019t want to meet the same fate as her mother.\nPrincess Diana made headlines months after the book\u2019s publication with the \u201cSquidgygate\u201d scandal. Recordings from 1990 of a private conversation with her close friend, James Gilbey, were leaked. Many people found the timing to be suspicious. The palace denied any involvement in the leak, and the Prince and Princess of Wales separated a few months later. The royal couple eventually divorced in 1996.\n(Princess Diana with Prince Harry and Prince William, 1995) credit: Anwar Hussein/Getty Images\nStill, she was the most famous woman in the world and the public didn\u2019t lose interest. Princess Diana was worried that the family she married into, saw her as a loose end that needed tying up. Prince Charles continued seeing Camilla Parker-Bowles, despite still being legally married to his estranged wife. In November of 1995, she gave an interview with Martin Bashir for the BBC, where she provided more details on her experiences with the royal family and thoughts about the future of the monarchy.\nIn May 2021, it made headlines that Martin used fake documents and fueled Princess Diana\u2019s \u201cparanoia\u201d, to manipulate her into doing the interview back in 1995. This caused widespread outrage. Princess Diana\u2019s sons released statements condemning Martin Bashir\u2019s actions.\nHow did an interview from 1995 take over twenty years to conclude? The BBC initially conducted an internal investigation into Martin Bashir in 1996. In Andrew Morton\u2019s 2004 book, Diana: In Pursuit of Love, Martin Bashir\u2019s deceit was discussed at length. Perhaps, this was a public relations exercise to continue the \u201cparanoid\u201d and \u201cmentally ill\u201d narrative that plagues Princess Diana\u2019s memory. Coincidentally, around the time of the infamous interview, Princess Diana claimed brake failure while driving her green Audi. She suspected the brakes were tampered with. Even if it were a legitimate case of vehicular malfunction, it doesn\u2019t make this alleged incident less terrifying.\nThe last year of Princess Diana\u2019s life focused on her humanitarian endeavors and the issue of landmines she became passionate about. She aligned herself with the British Red Cross and Halo Trust. Princess Diana visited the most impacted regions. Her visit to Angola caused controversy as she was on air being accused of supporting the \u201cLabour Party\u201d and was referred to as a \u201cloose cannon\u201d. She clarified that she wasn\u2019t a political figure, but a humanitarian one.\n\nEngland\u2019s Rose Didn\u2019t Wilt\nAugust 31st, 2022, will be the twenty-fifth anniversary of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales. The impact she had on the world is still felt. One of the reasons why she\u2019s so loved, is that despite being a woman of such elevated status, she was reachable. People related to her as she was honest about her struggles. Princess Diana was a woman of immense wealth and privilege but used her status to be of service to vulnerable populations and her accessibility was unmatched. The family she married into mistreated her. Maybe, she could\u2019ve chosen a different way to resolve situations, but she was up against a powerful institution.\nFor decades, reporters, authors, royalists, and other sources, acted with bias against Princess Diana. Weaponizing her very real mental health struggles to depict her as uncontrollable or deserving of her maltreatment. She started as a naive nineteen-year-old who was pushed into marriage and was abandoned by those closest to her when she didn\u2019t live up to unattainable expectations.\nCamilla Parker-Bowles is projected to be Queen Consort when Prince Charles becomes king. How Prince Charles and Camilla Parker-Bowles treated Princess Diana should be remembered truthfully. Princess Diana didn\u2019t deserve any of it. It\u2019s an injustice she died without an apology or validation. As the saying goes, karma never forgets an address. Those who last laugh, get the last laugh.\n(British Punker holding personalized floral tribute, 1997) credit: Thomas Coex/AFP", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 41, "created_time": 1630443896818, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Princess Diana", "Mental Health", "History", "Culture", "Equality"]}, {"author": "Chantal", "post_id": "73952b6f5ba", "user_id": "388380f36545", "title": "A Decade Long September", "content": "A Decade Long September\nThe paralyzing grief of witnessing my ex-boyfriend\u2019s murder\nvia Undark.org\nThe Beginning\nFor almost a decade I mourned a man I was deeply in love with. We had been in an on again-off again relationship for almost six years. I remember the first time I met him. I was getting off an elevator with a friend and he was getting on. Our eyes locked. He smiled widely. He just came home from serving a three-and-a-half-year prison sentence.\nSo, this was the infamous Ramel. He was the older brother of my friend I was on my way to see. As I made my way down the hall, I heard him ask the person he was with, \u201cYo, who\u2019s that white girl? What\u2019s her name?\u201d\nThe neighborhood was abuzz anticipating his homecoming. His sister read me letters he wrote to her from prison. Ramel was feared widely and his street reputation spanned across the five boroughs of New York City. No one ever expected us to become involved with one another.\nRamel during his prison sentence (age: approximately 19 years old) via Instagram\nCupid\u2019s Chokehold\nSeptember 2nd, 2011, fell on a Friday. It was the start of Labor Day weekend. I spent the summer reevaluating the year and the people I allowed into my life. Additionally, I pondered if cutting off my ex-boyfriend, Ramel, was the right thing to do. In April 2011, I told Ramel that having him a part of my life was suffocating. He was involved in criminality, surrounded himself with users, and the overall toxicity was harmful.\nI made the heart-wrenching decision to cut him out of my life. Ramel didn\u2019t believe I was serious. After a few weeks, he began calling me and tried passing presents through my sister. I changed my number to make it easier to move on. Outwardly, I looked content with this course of action. Secretly, I cried because I missed him so much.\nOn the second day of September 2011, I laid on a couch in the living room. I was falling asleep. The last thing I remember before I heard two gunshots was my mother draping a blanket over me. Immediately ran to the window and saw a man clutching his chest. He took a few steps before collapsing. I let out a wail and ran to the front door. I knew it was Ramel. My mother blocked me from leaving. I begged her to move out of the way. She was tearing up as she said, \u201cChantal, it\u2019s not Ramel. Please, calm down.\u201d\nWe both knew it was Ramel dying below us. He was shot in the chest at 6:10 pm and was pronounced dead at Bronx Lebanon Hospital.\nRamel in Manhattan during the Spring of 2011 via Facebook\nLove isn\u2019t Death Proof\nMy sister and I went upstairs to Ramel\u2019s mother\u2019s apartment to provide comfort to his father figure, \u201cUncle Jeffrey\u201d. He told me when he looked through the peephole, he was so relieved when he saw me and my sister. He hugged us tightly. We were still in shock that Ramel was dead. His mother was at the hospital to identify his body.\nTo keep our spirits up, we began to tell funny memories of him. This worked for a while until \u201cUncle Jeffrey\u201d teared up and said, \u201cBaby girl, I know how much my nephew meant to you. You\u2019re the only one in his life who wanted him to make something of himself.\u201d\nHis statement made me recall a time where one of Ramel\u2019s friends called him because they needed help settling a score. This was so common \u2014 so-called friends using Ramel\u2019s feared reputation as battle armor. I was on edge that something bad was going to happen. I begged him not to go. Being loyal to his fair-weather friends always put him at risk. Out of frustration, I grabbed his sneakers and threw them out my bedroom window. He was so angry. He put on my Hello Kitty slippers and went upstairs to his mother\u2018s apartment to get another pair of sneakers. Living by this code is what cost him his life.\nPeople often wondered what I saw in Ramel. They didn\u2019t see the side of Ramel he kept hidden. A soulful and sensitive person. He had a boyish charm I discovered when my mother once came into my room to kiss us goodnight. He used to watch basketball on television with my brother. He used to playfight with me and my sister. My mother still gets choked up when she mentions how he cooked her grits in the morning before she went to work.\nWhen Ramel\u2019s mother returned from the hospital, a group of us went downstairs to the crime scene that was still taped off. Our alienation was quite visible. There were about ten of us and in the distance people watched on. It was almost as if they were relieved that he was dead. I told Ramel many times that people didn\u2019t respect him, they only feared him. Someone apart of the group asked out loud, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t he just get on his plane to Miami? Why did he come here?\u201d\nRamel was in the middle of packing for his Labor Day trip to Miami. He received a phone call. Someone was in trouble and he rushed to their aid. He ultimately was murdered for a situation that had nothing to do with him. Ramel\u2019s best friend was among the group but left to go to Miami without him. His decision angers me to this day. Seeing him tweet a photograph of himself on an airplane while Ramel\u2019s dead body was at the hospital disgusted me.\nTeenaged Ramel with his beloved \u201cUncle Jeffrey\u201d via Facebook\nCheers to the Freakin\u2019 Weekend\nI vividly remember the deafening silence when I returned to my apartment. Ramel and I loved Rihanna. I wanted to feel his presence. I sang along to Rihanna\u2019s Loud album. I threw myself on the floor and sobbed when Cheers (Drink to That) played. I remembered a few weeks prior, I received a call from a restricted number, where the caller said nothing, only played that song. It dawned on me. It was Ramel. He was too afraid to reveal himself to me. I hated myself for cutting him off. Unbeknownst to me until recently, I punished myself for many years for this decision. My self-hatred heightened as I realized that burning all of our photographs and deleting traces of him off my social media was foolish to do. Ramel was gone and all I have are memories. It\u2019s as if our time together never existed.\nI was befuddled when I read The New York Post Blotter\u2019s claim that Ramel was shot in the chest and the head \u2014 not the case. I was outraged that it was mentioned he was arrested five times, \u201cincluding once for murder\u201d. I had a flashback of Ramel having an emotional breakdown. He kept saying he was an animal and the world doesn\u2019t see him as human. He had terrible nightmares as well and often feared he was going to hell. To add further disrespect, the management of the apartment complex he was murdered in, didn\u2019t wash his blood off the pavement for days. Even in death, society didn\u2019t restore his dignity or basic humanity.\nI was traumatized witnessing his murder and navigating grief. People began to act vitriolic towards me. I\u2019m a creative person and wanted to express the pain of Ramel\u2019s death. I began to gather photographs that people were posting of him. I used online photo editing applications to edit the photographs. I saw people post them and thanked me for doing so.\nI randomly received a hateful message from a woman who caused trouble in our relationship. I haven\u2019t seen or spoken to her in years. She accused me of stealing photographs of Ramel from her Facebook profile. This wasn\u2019t the case, and I replied telling her that. I expressed why was she so worried about photographs at a time like this? I immediately blocked her. This opened the floodgates to anonymous messages and restricted calls threatening me to stop talking about Ramel and not to come to the funeral.\nRamel\u2019s mother and certain family members distanced themselves from me. I needed to know where his funeral was going to be held. I wanted to chip in for an outfit for his burial. My Facebook messages and calls went ignored. I had to cold-call funeral homes in The Bronx and Harlem to inquire if his services were going to be there. Thankfully, I found out where his funeral services were going to be, by doing this.\nI skipped his wake and only stayed at his funeral for twenty minutes. I made my way to his open casket and gasped. He was dressed in a cheap outfit and wore fake Versace glasses. I used to rub his belly when he was alive. I did this while he was in the casket. He felt hollow. I heard a crinkling paper sound. The love of my life, who selflessly sacrificed himself for others, was stuffed like a scarecrow.\nI felt unsafe emotionally and physically. I saw a close friend who he viewed as a sister. She tried to reassure me that nothing would happen. She told me over and over that he loved me and wanted me to be there. She held on to my arm tightly and I broke free. I ran into the middle of the street and flagged down a taxi.\nBesides \u201cUncle Jeffrey\u201d and Ramel\u2019s close friend, the taxi driver was the only one who showed me kindness. He was an African Muslim. He pulled over and took out his prayer beads from his glove compartment. I asked what he was doing. He told me he was helping guide Ramel to Paradise and asking Allah to accept him. I sobbed and he reached over to comfort me. I was charged nothing for the ride.\nRamel wearing his favorite designer, Gucci (date unknown) via Facebook\nPan\u2019s Labyrinth: The Trauma Edition\nThe first year of Ramel\u2019s death was excruciating. I had constant flashbacks of seeing him after he was shot and reoccurring nightmares. One nightmare still frightens me to think about. I\u2019m in my apartment and the doorbell rings. I open the door and Ramel is standing there \u2014 he looks almost zombie-like. The flesh is falling off his face as he asks me, \u201c Why didn\u2019t you want to talk to me? I needed you.\u201d\nMonths forged on and I was able to conduct some daily activities. With trauma, sometimes the mind forgets but your body doesn\u2019t. I was going to Target near Yankee Stadium with my sister. She said something funny that made me laugh. Suddenly, a car backfired. I had a flashback of hearing the gunshots the day Ramel was murdered. I hyperventilated and began to shake. I couldn\u2019t hear my sister call my name. I did feel her slap me. I snapped out of it. She felt bad that she wasn\u2019t equipped with the knowledge of deescalating a trauma episode. I was apologizing through my tears, as she held me.\nI visited \u201cUncle Jeffrey\u201d from time to time at Ramel\u2019s mother\u2019s apartment. I remember on a bad day, he cried. He told me how much my visits meant to him. They meant a lot to me, too. He was our number one supporter. Our entanglement with relationship-saboteurs was a common theme. I was the one \u201ctrying to change him\u201d or \u201csteal him away\u201d from loved ones. Ramel was the breadwinner for multiple people. Criminality is what made his money and also put him in danger. I didn\u2019t care if he didn\u2019t have two pennies to rub together. I wanted him to live.\nIt took for Ramel to die for some to realize that my involvement in his life kept him safe. This caused a few family members to make statements that implicated that I was partially to blame for his death. If I \u201ctried harder\u201d or \u201cdidn\u2019t cut him off\u201d he would still be here. These were the same people who didn\u2019t want me in his life while he was alive.\nThis wasn\u2019t the only instance of emotional manipulation. His family planned a cookout for the year-anniversary of his death. I didn\u2019t know about it until a close friend told me about receiving an invitation via Facebook. I was hurt that I wasn\u2019t invited. About a week before the cookout\u2019s date, I received a Facebook message from one of his aunt\u2019s inviting me. I felt foolish because I thought I rushed to judgment. This was short-lived as I received a Facebook message from his mother asking me to contribute financially to the cookout \u2014 which I wasn\u2019t even initially invited to. Needless to say, I didn\u2019t go.\nFor years, I struggled with the hot and cold nature of how his family treated me. It made grieving and dealing with the severe trauma of witnessing Ramel\u2019s murder unbearable. It deepened my depression and exacerbated my anxiety. This is the first time that I\u2019m openly writing about these experiences. It\u2019s terrifying and liberating at the same time. I feel obligated to stay connected to Ramel\u2019s family members. I\u2019m cordial and acknowledge his family suffered an enormous loss. I created a healthy boundary that shows them respect but protects me as well.\nHis two youngest siblings and \u201cUncle Jeffrey\u201d I adore. They remind me of the good times I had with Ramel. I hope his uncle will find happiness again. His aura is drenched in grief and sadness. Ramel was more of a son to him than a nephew. His little brother overcame the obstacle of losing his older brother at such a young age and completed high school. He told my sister to tell me. He wanted me to be proud of him. I\u2019m so proud of him.\nRamel\u2019s last summer via Facebook\nThe Emancipation\nRamel\u2019s death catalyzed my political awakening. I\u2019m able to assess his life and murder from a macro/micro level. I\u2019ve read books, attended panel discussions, and became an activist. Race and socio-economics played a role in his murder. Death and grief led the way for me to educate myself and gain a much-needed sociological perspective for my life\u2019s experiences.\nThis past year was transformative for me. For almost a decade, my family urged me to seek help. Ramel\u2019s murder certainly wasn\u2019t my first trauma, but it changed the course of my life. I cried about it. I dreamt about it. I had explosive anger about it. I never truly dealt with it or processed it.\nBeing in trauma-informed therapy is life-changing. Not only do I have a safe space to talk about my trauma, but I\u2019m given a psychological education. It\u2019s explained why my brain is rewired because of trauma. I\u2019ve learned coping mechanisms. I do have days where I feel defeated by trauma, but with a real support system, I get through it. I moved out of the apartment complex where I grew up, met and fell in love with Ramel, and eventually watched his life end. September 2nd, 2021 will be the first anniversary of his death where I will be at peace.\nI feel safe to honestly talk about Ramel. I needed to tell our story. This was necessary to set me free. I want people to know he existed. His life mattered. Knowing him changed me. I wish he was still here. He wasn\u2019t perfect and our relationship was hard to deal with, but we did love each other. We shared ourselves completely with one another. I hope Ramel knows I will never forget him. I feel a shift in my life. I grieved his death for almost a decade, and now I\u2019m grieving the reality of letting go.\nI love you, Ramel.\nRamel J.

Our unconventional teacher had re-purposed it, probably because he\u2019d been there since God was a lad and as a result, he enjoyed a lot of liberties. His \u201coffice\u201d was one of them.\nEvery Friday, we\u2019d wait for the bell, after which he\u2019d stub out his between-class Vantage cigarette, inhale a mouthful of coffee, and begin our weekly vocabulary quiz on ten words from the textbook glossary.\nKnowing the language meant we knew the difference between a Fresnel and a follow-spot, the difference between a proscenium and a patch bay. That knowledge empowered us and kept us safe.\nThat\u2019s the goal here.\nMy ear to a mobile phone, a lawyer I wasn\u2019t paying for was explaining backroom realities to me, and I was on the edge of my seat because, in over 10 years of scanning my keycard at the door, I was learning some pretty shocking realities for the first time.\n\u201cThey\u2019re trying to discharge her constructively. Do you know what Constructive Discharge means?\u201d She asked.\nAs soon as I heard the term \u2018Constructive Discharge,\u2019 I knew I\u2019d never seen it on a vocabulary quiz.\n\u201cNo. What does it mean?\u201d I asked.\nShe explained.\n\u201cConstructive discharge is a fancy way of saying \u201cbeing forced out.\u201d It\u2019s not good. And if you\u2019re not a lawyer or in human resources, you\u2019ll probably learn what it means when it\u2019s happening to you.\u201d\n\u201cOh my God. I\u2019ve seen this my entire career and never knew it even had a name.\u201d I thought.\nYou\u2019ve seen constructive Discharge too. You may have experienced it. We\u2019ve all made choices to avoid it.\nConstructive discharge defined\n\u201cWe can\u2019t fire you, but we\u2019ll make you so miserable you\u2019ll quit, and then we won\u2019t have to pay your unemployment.\u201d\nThen there\u2019s the textbook definition:\n\u201cA constructive discharge occurs when your employer has made working conditions unbearable, forcing you to resign.\u201d\nOr as one person put it.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t get handed a pink slip, but when you\u2019re not wanted, people have a way of letting you know.\u201d\nHR isn\u2019t always the secret police.\nEmployees aren\u2019t always victims of evil-doers.\nHowever, employers push employees out all the time to maintain and protect the, \u201cWe didn\u2019t do anything wrong, YOU did,\u201d power structure.\nConstructive Discharge looks like this:\n\u2014 Meeting invitations slow to a trickle, and you\u2019re excluded from emails and generally looped out of what\u2019s going on.\n\u2014 People stop talking to you or stop talking when you walk in.\n\u2014 Your emails don\u2019t get answers, or they arrive too late to be of value.\n\u2014 Suddenly, your work is not good enough, though nothing about your work has changed.\n\u2014 Reviews, once good or even glowing, are now mediocre or bad.\n\u2014 Instead of a bonus, you get a Performance Improvement Plan.\n\u2014 Warnings and write-ups start so they can justify your eventual termination with documentation of your \u201cpoor performance\u201d\n\u2014 Your work, clients, assignments go away, or they overwhelm you with work.\n\u2014 The words \u201cSet up to fail\u201d were practically invented to describe this scenario.\nConstructive Discharge is illegal\nIt isn\u2019t easy to prove you\u2019re a target, and it\u2019s even more challenging if you don\u2019t even know constructive discharge is a real thing.\nIf you\u2019ve ever experienced this and don\u2019t fully understand what\u2019s happening to you beyond knowing you\u2019re in the process of being excommunicated, it can be hell. It\u2019s not uncommon for the experience to leave long-lasting scars.\nTalk to anyone who\u2019s ever been through it. They\u2019ll tell you.\nKnowing constructive discharge exists and how it\u2019s used gives you power to predict what\u2019s coming and to protect yourself.\nSeeing the endgame helps you in two ways.\nYou know what to expect. Having a sense of what\u2019s coming next is enormously empowering.\nYou can go on the offensive and protect yourself. Constructive discharge works to crush your ego, making you feel you did something wrong and deserve this treatment.\nWithout strategy, you end up being a miserable pawn in your employer\u2019s endgame.\nRemember, they\u2019re almost certainly building a case to fire you in the event the hellscape they create for you doesn\u2019t persuade you to quit.\nIf you\u2019re getting pushed out, and you know what to look for you can prove constructive discharge and you can get unemployment benefits, be released from payback obligations on a signing bonus, and protect your mental health.\nYou\u2019re not crazy, incompetent, or a failure. This is real and it\u2019s carefully executed to leave you holding the bag and feeling like you did something wrong.\nIf they force you out, in addition to feeling horrible, you lose your paycheck, benefits health insurance, and possibly owe them money.\nWhat happened when my co-worker got pushed out\nThe lawyer was asking me about an incident I witnessed at work.\nTwo team members and I watched our supervisor call one of his reports, our teammate, a \u201cbitch\u201d to her face.\nBadda-bing Badda-bang, next thing you know, a third party reports the \u201cbitch\u201d incident to HR, and the employee, despite not reporting the incident is now \u201cthe problem\u201d and being steered toward a door labeled: Constructive Discharge.\nThis employee\u2019s uncommon response was to hire the lawyer now interviewing me and giving a name to something I\u2019ve been seeing and sensing for 20 years.\n\u201cIn most cases, an employee who voluntarily leaves a company \u2014 as opposed to one whose employment is terminated by the company against his or her will \u2014 is not entitled to unemployment benefits and loses the right to sue the company for wrongful termination.\u201d \u2014 Reference for Business Website.\nThey have a secret weapon they use against you\nA few weeks later, someone in the company HR department called to interview me, claiming to be a \u201ccompany investigator.\u201d\nIt was laughably cloak and dagger. And the investigator appeared to be enjoying his job working at the corporate equivalent of the FBI. It was more like the Wizard of Oz, yet I knew if I pulled the curtain back, I\u2019d be the next one through the constructive discharge door, so I said \u201cYessir\u201d a lot.\nAnd then it came. Just like clockwork. At the end of that call, the \u2018investigator\u2019 said, \u201cDon\u2019t speak to anyone about this event. It\u2019s an active investigation.\u201d\nMost employees are told to go on hard mute. They comply in these situations because they see how easily they can be blackballed.\nEveryone involved self-isolates, effectively turning up the heat in the hellscape the constructive discharge recipient walks into every day.\nIt works brilliantly.\nSilence is a hallmark of constructive discharge\nYour voluntary silence effectively recruits you to \u201ctheir side\u201d because you maintain ignorance while HR talks to everyone. They have all the information.\nEveryone else is in the dark. And that\u2019s right where they want you. Information is power, and HR arranges to have it all.\nSensing HR was especially keen to keep the lid on this situation, the minute I got off the phone with Agent Don\u2019t-Talk I started asking around\nIt didn\u2019t take long. The first person I talked to shared this.\n\u201cI had a friend who worked on that project. She couldn\u2019t get out fast enough. That project is famous for this kind of thing, and they can\u2019t get females to stay for long. They call the group \u2018The Wolfpack.\u201d\nWhen they insist, \u201cDon\u2019t talk to anyone about this.\u201d It\u2019s for them, not you.\nSilencing employees who know about the incident makes it easier to sweep ugly episodes under the rug.\nTheir \u201cmaintain radio silence\u201d guidance is not for your benefit.\nThe real damage wrought by constructive discharge\nThe most sinister thing about a constructive discharge is its power to make you lose faith in yourself.\nTermination from your job is no picnic, but being forced to \u201cfire yourself\u201d is slow burn torture.\nIn this case, the employee filed a discrimination claim with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which has the same effect of holding up a cross to a vampire. For several months, while the wheels of justice turned at a glacial pace, there was an impasse.\nEmployees are usually powerless. The EEOC is not. An employer may crush a person without giving it a thought, but they\u2019ll think twice about every move once you get the EEOC involved. They\u2019re scared of them.\nIf you or someone you know is facing this, educate yourself and hire a labor lawyer.\nDo one or both of these and your employer will back away from you like a hiker slathered in bacon grease backs away from a bear awaking from hibernation.\nDecide your route early. Timing is key in these situations.\nThe outcome\nAfter finding a new job, the employee resigned. They didn\u2019t sue, but having a lawyer made it harder for the company to abuse them.\nMost people don\u2019t \u201cLawyer Up\u201d because they worry about the cost, yet also because there\u2019s some stigma around \u201cLawyering Up.\u201d For a company to have floors full of lawyers, is smart, responsible, and expected. When an employee does it, they often get side-eye. Don\u2019t fall for it. It\u2019s okay to stand up for yourself even with your employer.\nIn this case, it cost my colleague less than $2000 and saved them from having to pay several thousand to their employer when they were forced out. And they were.\nThe real value of a lawyer is having someone on your side who knows the rules.\nIf you\u2019re in this situation\nConsider facing it head-on and saying directly to HR, \u201cThis isn\u2019t working. Let\u2019s negotiate an appropriate departure package.\u201d If they\u2019re smart and you have any leverage at all, this can work. Constructive Discharge almost always lowers morale. They want you out and fast; use that to your advantage.\nAnd if you\u2019re still balking at the possible cost, ask yourself, what online store are you going to order new confidence and self-esteem from when they destroy yours?\nThat\u2019s the hidden cost of constructive discharge.\nGet help if you do this. HR has more experience in this realm and more people on their side.\nI help experienced professionals re-package their work to get better jobs.

At its start, it was a glorious ride that took me across Europe, Australia, and Japan.\nYet, as the saying goes, all good things must end. Leadership churned, projects concluded, new faces replaced old ones. The party was over and someone turned on the lights. While my departure wasn\u2019t the proverbial \"take this job and shove it\" moment of daydreams, the day I left the office for the last time marks the moment I realized \"walking on air\" is saying because it's a feeling.\nIn the decade since I've worked with hundreds of post-corporate entrepreneurs, people who started climbing the corporate ladder, yet for various reasons opted out. After 10 years, these are the behaviors I\u2019ve observed in those who make it on their own.\n1. They show respect for their work in this small yet big way.\nRecently, I saw an exchange between a writer and a reader.\nReader: \"I occasionally use a few of your lines and add them to my pieces!\"\nWriter: \"Thanks for reading! Be careful. My work is copyrighted.\"\nIn a world where everyone wants to go viral, I've noticed the ones who make it are clear they own the rights to the content they create. How? Simple. They copyright their work.\nWhat you need to know about copyrights when you're starting is not complicated, yet not bothering to learn and implement basic protections communicates a wing-and-a-prayer approach that dispels the feeling of good faith a client needs to do business with you. If sorting copyright seems intimidating, know it\u2019s as easy as typing a few keystrokes.\nGet a basic explanation here. Or you can watch this video on how copyrights work.\n2. They don't confuse working with learning.\nIn the corporate cubicle farms and C-level bubbles, if you don\u2019t know things, it can be easy to hide your ignorance behind tenure, friendships, younger, hungrier subordinates \u2014 you name it. Out on your own, unless you have endless backing, and sometimes even if you do \u2014 looking at you Theranos \u2014 you have to bring it. The thing that appears even faster than your savings disappears is what you don\u2019t know and need to learn.\nThose who are still in the race are the ones who seem to always be saying, \u201cI just learned about this new thing \u2026\u201d\nAfter graduating college, there are virtually no guidelines for keeping pace with change. A few professions insist on continuing professional education, but we\u2019re on our own for the most part.\nWhen the rate of change exceeds the rate of learning, you become obsolete. Today, the world is changing faster than at any time before in history, making it easier to fall behind.\nDon't have thousands to drop on a course? Or the time to take it? No problem. You can do a lot for free and cheap. Remember this famous line?\n\"You wasted $150,000 on an education you coulda got for $1.50 in late fees at the public library.\" \u2014 Good Will Hunting\nA four cassette audiobook checked out of the local library and listened to in my car helped me launch a career that had been out of reach before. A friend of mine calls this Automobile University. Change takes confidence. The more you know the more confident you become.\nBeware of two temptations.\nFreebie-seeking. Free downloads teasing expensive courses are everywhere. Some are excellent and taking a test drive is smart, yet beware of prolonged freebie-surfing. Twenty free first chapters are not a book, and surfing free downloads isn\u2019t the equivalent of a course or a coach. Commit to something.\nSpending money on the paint job instead of the engine. Spending thousands on a website is one of the biggest mistakes I see new entrepreneurs make. This is why Levi\u2019s\u2122 is still here and the gold rush isn\u2019t. Levi\u2019s\u2122 made their name and their fortune selling jeans to hopeful gold miners. Most of the miners went bust. You know how it worked out for Levi\u2019s\u2122\n3. They surround themselves with others on a similar journey\n\u201cIf you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together\u201d \u2014 African proverb.\nIn 2010, I attended a live training with one of the top performance coaches in the world. A Harvard-educated, best-selling author who also authored the humble cassette tape course I'd listened to in my car years before.\nHere\u2019s where I learned the technique that saved me incalculable time and money over the years: Mastermind.\nA Mastermind is a small group of people who support each other and share ideas, give feedback and offer accountability and insight.\nThis trainer personally attributed most of his successes to the Mastermind process. He believed in it so much that all his students learned how to Mastermind, got into a Mastermind group, and had one meeting before the training concluded.\nTalk about your \"where has this been all my life\" moments.\nBeing in a Mastermind is how I survived those first several years after leaving my regular paycheck behind. My Mastermind is where I learned about most of the tools I use today and the courage to take the biggest and most necessary leaps came from this group.\nFor this reason, I started teaching the Mastermind process in workshops and at conferences. Here's a true story about what happened to someone who learned the Mastermind process from me in a conference session.\nIf you want to learn how to do this yourself, it's easy. Learn how to Mastermind here.\nYou'll hear people say, \"Just meet with people and talk about what you're doing. It\u2019s the same thing.\" It\u2019s not even close. Using the Mastermind method is 100 times more powerful. The magic is in the method.\nSurprisingly, very few people use this method. The ones who do, are almost always the ones who survive the entrepreneur churn to become profitable. Another thing I\u2019ve noticed is people who Mastermind don\u2019t talk about their Mastermind group, yet start talking to successful entrepreneurs and they\u2019ll tell you they have one\n4. They understand the timing.\nFor several years before resigning, I was in \u201cthinking about it\u201d mode, trying to figure out how to make my life work out of the corporate easy chair. A few years before making my exit, I was hanging out with a friend, talking about my business plans, flipping through the brochure for a popular course on how to start and run your own business. It had a $2,0000 price tag and in the brochure, the creator noted it took her ten years to make her first million.\n\"Ten years!\" I blurted out. \"I can't wait ten years!!!\" This was the first time I heard about the 10 years rule of thumb. Luckily, my friend was there to talk me off the ledge. \"But you're not starting from zero. You already have experience. It won't take you that long.\" She said. This was true. I was graduating from a 20-year corporate career, not college. However, looking back, that estimate turned out to be surprisingly accurate.\nOver the years, I've heard other entrepreneurs talk about the 10-year window. Angel List founder Naval Ravikant said, \"It takes 10 years to build a career in anything.\" Gary Vaynerchuk is another entrepreneur who talks about the 10-year window.\nSome springboard to apparent overnight success from a single viral post or hit the market with the right idea at the right time, but what most people experience comes from the fable of the rabbit and the hare. Slow and steady wins the race.\nBeware of fake bootstrappers because the \u201chelp\u201d is silent.\nThere's a thread in the social media world in which the most profitable female pop performer of the last several decades brags about her daughter paying for her college education \"all on her own.\" A comment on that post said it better than I ever could:\nEnough with the children of famous, fabulously wealthy, well-connected people acting like their kids don't have the advantages and connections 99.9% of us will never have. There's no shame in being rich, enjoy it without trying to make those of us who aren't famous, rich, and connected look like we're not working hard enough.\nThere are those who were wealthy from the start who act as if they got their first pair of shoes at sixth-grade graduation and walked to school uphill both ways. Why? Because born rich, died richer is not a good marketing story.\nIf someone's parents bankroll them or they luck into some other shortcut, don't count on hearing about it in their marketing. The only thing our culture celebrates more than being rich is \"Coming from nothing,\" so those who start wealthy or with outrageous advantages seldom tell you about it because it's better to let you assume they're a genius and a formidably hard worker.\nThere's nothing wrong with being rich and getting a headstart, or operating with the safety net wealthy parents, spouses, and trust funds offer. However, there's a lot wrong with pretending these aren\u2019t massive advantages and saying, \u201cIf I did this, anyone can.\u201d\nYou can win the lottery in a day, but you can't change careers or build a new business in a day. Those who survive aren't taken in by dreams and schemes of overnight success.\nLeaving isn\u2019t the hardest thing.\nIn 2021, Lauren Hough published the memoir titled \u201cLeaving Isn\u2019t the Hardest Thing\u201d about her experiences growing up in and eventually leaving a cult. The title is likely in response to the common belief that cult members can\u2019t leave, and will be punished if they attempt to leave.\nIt\u2019s the same here. Leaving isn\u2019t the hardest thing. The hard part starts when you find yourself in a new world, figuring out how to do the things that were all \u201ctaken care of\u201d when you were an employee.\nWhether you remain in corporate or graduate to something else, don\u2019t go alone. Find or create a tribe or group that supports and informs each other on the journey.\nCareer realist helping industry veterans with 20+ years of experience repackage and redirect to get better jobs.

In Manhattan, many are famous. In rural Virginia, few are, so when someone from your neck of the woods makes it to the \u201cbig time,\u201d it echoes.\nAuthor S.A. Cosby writes amazing stories. I\u2019ve read two of them \u2014 \u201cBlacktop Wasteland\u201d and \u201cRazorblade Tears.\u201d They were fantastic, and I can\u2019t wait to see the movies, which are on the way.\n\u201cRazorblade Tears\u201d has been on just about every top 5 and top 10 book list for 2021 and 2022, and their author has been featured in the New York Times, Washington Post, and on and on. While I don\u2019t know S.A. Cosby, I know his characters and the places in his books I recognize as home.\nMaybe that\u2019s why when someone attempted to school Cosby on Twitter recently, I gave it a little more attention than the usual flotsam and jetsam you find there. Cosby\u2019s response made me chuckle.\nRandom Tweet Person Tweets: You have just 3 capitals & 1 misplaced period in your tweet. You used 2 & to in the back to back sentences.\nYou clearly know how to write but choose to look uneducated. Writer better if you want to be taken seriously.\nReply Tweet per S.A. Cosby:\nI wrote a New York Times best selling novel. I think I\u2019m taken seriously.\nFull disclosure: I\u2019m not a big proponent of responding to dogs that bark while the caravan passes by, especially on Twitter, but this illustrates a point so brilliant it\u2019s incandescent.\nPeople will treat you like a clown when you own the circus.\nAnd it\u2019s rarely worth correcting them.\nBeware of the sinister reflex.\nWhen someone sneezes nearby, we say, \u201cBless you.\u201d Shortened from its original form, \u201cGod Bless You.\u201d Most of us have no idea why we do this. Of course, it\u2019s good manners, but it\u2019s also a reflex. We\u2019re taught when we\u2019re young, or we mimic those around us.\nPeople once believed a sneeze caused someone to expel their soul from their body, so \u201cGod bless you\u201d or \u201cBless you\u201d was offered as protection against an evil spirit snatching your soul.\nSometimes we do things without knowing why. Sometimes these things are incidental, like sneezing. Sometimes they\u2019re more important.\nA friend who\u2019s been job hunting a while wasn\u2019t selected for a job he\u2019s certainly qualified for, and still, he didn\u2019t get it. When he mentioned this to me, I could see him making a left turn to go down the rabbit hole of \u201cOh, why didn\u2019t they choose me? What\u2019s wrong with me? What\u2019s wrong with my resum\u00e9. Where did I go wrong?\u201d\nA strange demon takes possession of many job seekers. Its presence revealed by the tendency to assume whoever decides our fate in job-related scenarios is an all-knowing God or Goddess. And their choice to give us a thumbs up or down is a reflection of us, who we are, what we can do, our potential, character, personality, integrity, and on and on.\nNope. Not even close. The power a decision-maker possesses at the moment they give the thumbs up or down is probably the most power they\u2019ll have in their entire life.\nWhoever has this brief power over you by some turn of the screw or roll of the dice is not necessarily more intelligent, more educated, wiser, or more experienced than you. They\u2019re just another person. Whether they\u2019re \u201cOz The Great and Terrible\u201d is up to you.\nHere\u2019s the magic\nIn her best-selling book, \u201cBig Magic,\u201d author Liz Gilbert tells the story of submitting an article to a major magazine editor. The article is rejected with a \u201cthis just doesn\u2019t feel right for us\u201d note. Not long after, Gilbert soared to worldwide acclaim for her book \u201cEat, Pray, Love.\u201d\nNow, in her world reupholstered with fame and notoriety, Gilbert submits the same article to the same editor.

Whatever you call it, they're on the rise.\nNo one tells contract horror stories because it's embarrassing.\nI begged the client to negotiate down the extra-long two-year non-compete for a job where no intellectual property exchanged hands.\nWhen I read the clause about requiring a hair follicle drug test for a standard cubicle sitter material job, I advised, \"Do not agree to that.\"\n\"Why? I don't do illegal drugs.\"\nAny drug you take could come up on this test. And you have no control over where the information goes once someone else has it.\nBut the one I didn't see coming was the contract demanded the candidate agree to let them scan all the electronics belonging to any legal resident of their household. That's children's iPads, laptops, and phones.\nAccording to the Federal Trade Commission, 16% to 18% of American workers are under a non-compete clause, and 30% to 40% have a non-compete placed before them after they've accepted the job, often on the first day of work.\nLegitimate protection of intellectual property oncd existed only in narrow niches where people actually handled privileged information, and only a few people were asked to sign non-compete and similar restrictive clauses. That\u2019s changed.\nIn 2014, sandwich chain store Jimmy John's came under investigation by the New York Office of the Attorney General for asking its minimum wage delivery drivers and shop crew to sign away their right to work a similar job for two years. In the end, Jimmy John's removed the restrictive clause.\nNo ship is unsinkable.\nThe thing about these contractual traps is that you cede control when you walk in the door, but the ankle bracelet restricting your movement doesn't click on and tighten until you leave.\nThe only time an employer will exercise the right to scan your data is when you're in a fight with them, and what do you think they are going to do with what they find if that's where it starts?\nAfter listening to me explain a few of how this could go horribly wrong, my client said, \"I'm going to be making 6-figures for the first time in my life. I'm signing it. I don't feel like I have a choice.\"\nYou have to admit, it's a helluva setup, and it traps most people, yet it doesn't trap everyone. The ones that refuse to hand over the keys to their future don't call me late at night.\nThey seem fair but are they?\nA sample of what one restrictive clause, a non-compete, can do:\nNon-competes are sometimes used to protect trade secrets, which can promote innovation.\nBy reducing the probability of worker exit, non-competes may increase employers\u2019 incentives to provide costly training.\nEmployers with especially high turnover costs could use non-competes to match with workers who have a low desire to switch jobs in the future.\nBut non-compete agreements can also impose large costs on workers.\nWorker bargaining power is reduced after a non-compete is signed, possibly leading to lower wages.\nNon-competes sometimes induce workers to leave their occupations entirely, foregoing accumulated training and experience in their fields.\nSource: Office of Economic Policy U.S. Department of the Treasury, Non-compete Contracts: Economic Effects and Policy Implications, March 2016\nThings have gotten out of hand.\nMost people work their entire careers without coming into contact with privileged intellectual property that needs \"protection.\" But that's a great line, and it's presented to candidates in a way that makes it easy to go along.\nBut ask yourself, who would sign away their rights if the money they needed to live and health insurance were not hanging in the balance? No one.\nNon-Competes have become so exploitative in the U.S. states are banning them and the President signed an executive order reining them in.\nCommon restrictive clauses.\nNon-competition \u2014Stealing your right to choose who you work for, non-compete clauses put your career in a prison-from-home ankle bracelet for however long the employer believes they can get away with it. Adding distance restrictions is fast becoming standard.\nNon-solicitation \u2014 If you quit Ramco to go to Bramco and do the same thing, this clause says you can't take clients/customers/suppliers of Ramco with you.\nNon-dealing \u2014 Simple. Stay away from former clients/customers/suppliers, and if they come to you, you have to say, \"No.\"\nNon-poaching \u2014 See how they color the action using the pejorative term \"poaching?\" As if you're killing an endangered species. Only rich people get to do that, right? Because only the richest can afford to pay. See how this works? Anyone can tell you not to swim off their pier, but they can't stop you from swimming off someone else's pier next door and call it \"poaching\" just because it's over the same river. You can swim in the river unless you agree not to, which many candidates do.\nNon-Disclosure Agreement \u2014 the notorious NDA's most recent claim to fame is that this is how Harvey Weinstein kept people from talking.\nFor the record, when people tell me they don't know what to say when they\u2019re asked about their salary, I advise them to say, \"I signed an NDA and about revealing any personal financial information.\"\nEmployers can put anything in their agreements and have done, exploiting workers to the degree that in the U.S. the government is getting involved.\nIn case you're wondering.\nYour company knows all this. Employers know the average Joe or Josefine can't afford to take their employment contract to a lawyer, and employment contract bias in favor of employers is entirely normalized.\nStill, companies are people, and many in HR wish you knew to push back instead of trusting that HR has any power to do the \"right thing\" when their obligation is to the very company asking you to sign away your rights. Fact is, they probably signed away theirs too.\n\"Everybody signs\" is a face-saving phrase that translates to \"I felt had no choice.\"\nStart with these steps.\nMost people are \"scared\" of contracts, sign them, and hope for the best, but you can save yourself a lot of pain with a bit of knowledge and a little effort.\nRead your contract with a highlighter and highlight the restrictions and errors you find. And don't be surprised when you find them.\nNow, put the clauses you highlighted in priority order. What matters most to you?\nNext, identify what rights or freedoms each clause asks you to sacrifice. For example, when my client talked about a \"third party scan\" of their electronic devices, it seemed like no big deal. Parsed into, \u201cyou\u2019re signing away your right to privacy and that of everyone in your family,\u201d it landed differently.\nYou want to go in the door with several requests and be willing to \"give up\" the ones that matter least to get the ones that matter most. Going in and asking for one adjustment only is the fastest way to an impasse.\nThe where is as important as the how.\nWhere is the contract based? In an increasingly virtual world, you could be working in Maine for a client in Europe while being paid by your company based in California. What matters is where the contract establishes the \"Venue.\"\n\u201cChoice of Law; Venue. This agreement and all matters arising out of or relating to this agreement, are governed by the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to any conflict of laws provisions that would result in the application of the laws of a different jurisdiction. \u2014 Contract sample\nWhy does this matter if you can't change it? Because each state handles its labor law differently. In one state, non-competes may not be legal in another state a non-compete may be \"legal\" but never enforced in yet another state they can be legal and enforced to the letter. You need to know. States also treat arbitration differently. As unpleasant as it is to imagine the worst-case scenario, it will be different in California than in North Carolina.\nFor example, in California, non-competes are illegal, sort of. Know what laws apply in your state. Sometimes, it's up to you to point out an illegal contract clause.\nThey will make changes.\nContracts aren't crafted as fair agreements. Employment contracts, in particular, are written to protect one party. Only through negotiation do these agreements become equitable. Candidates ask for and get changes to contracts.\nPeople are people. HR rarely tells its secrets, yet when they say, \"Everyone signs this,\" they don't mean it literally. They mean, please be one of those people who have no idea how to handle this and just sign this \u201cas is\u201d and make my life easier.\nIf you sign the \"I won't take another job at another hospital within 50 miles for two years\" clause, you're saying yes to commuting at least 100 miles if this job doesn't work out. Ask the nurse who signed her contract in a city with 29 hospitals only to learn it was a toxic environment and she couldn't stay. Because she signed without requesting changes, she commutes 120 miles round trip three days a week. She thought, \"I have no choice.\"\nLegislation is coming, yet the wheels of justice turn slowly.\nStale out of college my job was all that stood between me and shame. That's true for most people, whether they want to admit it, our culture is cruel to the unemployed and it's another reason these restrictions are easy traps to build for job candidates.\nThe more you know, the more confident you'll be. More and more candidates are asking for these restrictions to be removed or reduced. You are not alone, it just feels like it.\nThe Corporate Glossary series reveals the truth behind common corporate words and phrases, so you don't get duped.

West Texas was one of these comparatively fortunate places. And considering the Lone Star State\u2019s long-running antipathy toward government oversight, it made sense that some there would choose to ignore or downplay warnings from federal and local health officials.\nBut elements of the script have since flipped, and Covid-19 case numbers are now spiking in many counties across West Texas. One might assume that, in the face of rising caseloads, many there would abandon their prior insouciance and embrace masks and other common-sense measures recommended by the nation\u2019s top public health officials. But that doesn\u2019t seem to be happening; if anything, the resolve of many Covid-19 skeptics appears to be stiffening. Even state officials who can no longer ignore the virus continue to lash out at public health authorities. (Last week, Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick criticized Dr. Anthony Fauci, saying that Fauci \u201chas been wrong every time on every issue\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t need his advice anymore.\u201d)\nAnyone who has ever butted heads with a friend, a family member, or a colleague about one of science\u2019s hot button issues \u2014 be it global warming, the safety of vaccines, or the gravity of the current pandemic \u2014 has likely walked away from the experience frustrated and exasperated at the other person\u2019s stubborn and apparently nonsensical refusal to consider the facts.\nBut psychologists say that the denial of facts is often rooted in identity and belonging, not in ignorance and that changing minds may require a lot more than sound reasoning.\n\u201cThe people who deny science are often trying to uphold membership in something that they find meaningful,\u201d says Nina Eliasoph, PhD, a professor of sociology at the University of Southern California. That meaningful thing could be a political or religious affiliation or some other group that prizes certain ideas or ideals. Whatever shape that group takes, the important thing is that it has other members \u2014 it\u2019s a community.\nOnce a community absorbs an idea into its collective viewpoint, rejecting that idea becomes akin to rejecting the whole community, Eliasoph says. And that sort of rejection is a very, very difficult thing for any of its members to do. \u201cThis is why you talk with people who deny science and the goalposts are always changing,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat really matters is the membership in the thing that has meaning, and to keep that membership you have to ignore certain ideas and pay attention to others.\u201d\n\u201cThe people who deny science are often trying to uphold membership in something that they find meaningful.\u201d\nThe causes and correlates of denial\nDenial, in a nutshell, is the rejection or diminution of a phenomenon that has a large \u2014 and sometimes overwhelming \u2014 body of supporting evidence.\nWhen it comes to science denial, global warming may be the most conspicuous example. Science\u2019s case that the planet is warming, that people are contributing heavily to this warming, and that this warming \u2014 if not addressed \u2014 will imperil billions of lives is almost unassailable. And yet huge chunks of the American electorate evince some form of climate-change denial. Even people who are worried about global warming are often unwilling to make even small personal sacrifices that, collectively, could make a meaningful difference.\nWhy do people do this? Experts say that our aversion to cognitive dissonance is one explanation. \u201cCognitive dissonance is a negative emotional state characterized by discomfort or tension, or maybe feelings of anxiety or guilt, that\u2019s produced from beliefs or behaviors that are inconsistent with one another,\u201d says April McGrath, PhD, an associate professor of psychology at Mount Royal University in Canada who has published work on cognitive dissonance. For example, a person who believes the planet is warming may also want to drive a gas-guzzling SUV, and these competing interests create cognitive dissonance.\nBecause cognitive dissonance is unpleasant, people tend to want to get rid of it. And McGrath says that there are generally two ways that people can do this: change a behavior \u2014 that is, ditch the SUV for an electric vehicle \u2014 or change a belief. Most people go with option B. \u201cChanging a behavior is usually difficult because most behaviors are rewarding,\u201d she says. Changing a belief is often easier, and that\u2019s where some element of denial comes into play. \u201cThis could mean trivializing the source of the dissonance\u201d \u2014 telling yourself that switching to an electric car won\u2019t make any difference in the grand scheme \u2014 \u201cor adding some new belief or idea that supports or rationalizes your choice,\u201d she says. The latter could entail embracing conspiracy theories that argue climate-change consensus is some kind of nefarious ploy.\nBefore any of us gets too judgy, McGrath says that everyone engages in denial. \u201cWe are all constantly bombarded by decisions or choices that create dissonance or conflicts, so we can\u2019t always act in accordance with our ideals,\u201d she says.\nOnce a community absorbs an idea into its collective viewpoint, rejecting that idea becomes akin to rejecting the whole community.\nAlong with cognitive dissonance, there are many other scenarios or psychological states that tend to produce denial. \u201cThese are all related to each other \u2014 they\u2019re not totally independent,\u201d says Craig Anderson, PhD, a distinguished professor of psychology at Iowa State University. He terms one \u201cbelief perseverance,\u201d which refers to people\u2019s attachment to ideas or conceptions that they\u2019ve held in the past. We don\u2019t like to change our minds, Anderson explains, and we tend to ignore new information that challenges our long-held views. (Confirmation bias \u2014 seeking out and retaining only the information that supports one\u2019s view \u2014 is a related concept.)\n\u201cReactance\u201d is another, he says. This refers to the negative feelings that people experience when their freedom is somehow threatened \u2014 like if state or local government officials tell them that they can\u2019t shop, dine, travel, or congregate as usual. \u201cFear is also a big one,\u201d he says. If someone finds a belief or idea to be scary \u2014 both global warming and Covid-19 are ready examples \u2014 that fear is a powerful motivator of denial.\nWhile all of these overlapping factors can feed into denial, some who study human psychology say that group dynamics \u2014 coupled with every person\u2019s vital need to belong \u2014 are at the root of many science deniers\u2019 seemingly inscrutable beliefs and behaviors.\nScratching a deep psychological itch\nRebekka Darner, PhD, is director of the Center for Mathematics, Science, and Technology at Illinois State University. Much of her work has focused on improving science literacy and combatting science denial among the general public.\nDarner says that a key element of effective science teaching and communication involves \u201cself-determination theory.\u201d This theory holds that people have three basic psychological needs that undergird their motivation to engage in any behavior.\n\u201cThe first is a need for autonomy, or the belief that an action came from the self,\u201d she says. The second is the need for competence. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t mean that a person actually is competent,\u201d she clarifies. What\u2019s important is that the person believes that they are competent and capable of achieving their goals. \u201cThe third one is the need for relatedness \u2014 a sense of belonging and that other people need you and value your input,\u201d she says.\nFor those hoping to weaken a friend or loved one\u2019s science denial, Darner says that it\u2019s necessary to start from a place of respect and amity.\nThe social groups that people identify with tend to satisfy all three of these basic psychological needs, Darner says. And because of this, people are strongly motivated to accept their group\u2019s ideas or to engage in behaviors that are valued within their social spheres. For example, she says that some social groups may place a high value on bucking authority (\u201cYou\u2019re not going to control me\u201d) and this attitude and its associated behaviors \u2014 like not wearing a mask \u2014 can supersede all others.\nSelf-determination theory helps explain why the widespread adoption of anti-science or anti-expert views is so dangerous. If a person\u2019s group identity motivates them to deny one element of science \u2014 like the person who rejects the theory of evolution on religious grounds \u2014 then that can be a problem, but at least it\u2019s somewhat contained. If huge numbers of Americans decide that a core element of their group identity is the rejection of science or of creditable expertise, then that\u2019s a problem of a whole other magnitude.\nThe good news, Darner says, is that beliefs linked to group identities are not intractable. \u201cHumans are complex, which works in our favor,\u201d she says. \u201cNo person associates with a single identity, and we all have a variety of different communities with which we interact.\u201d When people are regularly exposed to diverse groups and ideas that clash with their own, the resulting contradictions create uncertainty. And while people tend to find uncertainty uncomfortable, Darner says that uncertainty is often the precursor of learning and idea reassessment.\nUnfortunately, she says that some elements of contemporary life may steer people away from these helpful, perspective-balancing encounters with other viewpoints. The ideological myopia \u2014 as well as the us-against-them vitriol \u2014 that characterizes much of today\u2019s media, both traditional (newspapers, cable news) and new (social media, online message boards), tends to strengthen a person\u2019s opinions and their feeling of being part of a large and like-minded community. Pushing back against all that can be a Sisyphean endeavor.\nFor those hoping to weaken a friend or loved one\u2019s science denial, Darner says that it\u2019s necessary to start from a place of respect and amity. \u201cPeople need to feel like you value them and their opinion,\u201d she says. \u201cThis kind of relationship has to be there first.\u201d It may help to ask questions \u2014 rather than offer counter-arguments \u2014 and to respond with interest and noncritical feedback to articles or viewpoints the other person shares. Once you do that and you\u2019ve established more congenial footing, your counterpart may be more willing to consider your side of things. It goes without saying that, however satisfying it may be, telling someone that they\u2019re ignorant and brandishing facts or articles that back your case is the kind of \u201cI\u2019m right and you\u2019re wrong\u201d approach that\u2019s almost certain to fail, and is likely to solidify the person\u2019s opposition to your viewpoints.\nBut even if you say and do all the right things, your odds of success are probably slim. \u201cIndividuals very seldom fulfill basic psychological needs for other individuals,\u201d Darner says. \u201cThat fulfillment comes from a larger community and identifying with them and being a part of them.\u201d\nThe science denier in your life may eventually come around, but it\u2019s unlikely that you\u2019re going to reel that person back in on your own.", "comment_count": 42, "like_count": 2872, "created_time": 1594242091035, "comment": [{"user_id": "890b995a50b5", "comment_time": 1594242091035, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "5b8209a2086b", "comment_time": 1594300872508, "comment": "Thank you for writing an article which speaks to the hopelessness of attempting to establish a reasonable dialogue with some people about Covid-19 risks and prevention protocol pros and cons.

Their laughter spread to other students. Six weeks later, two-thirds of the school\u2019s pupils had experienced bouts of uncontrollable laughter and crying that could last for hours and often recurred day after day. Eventually, hundreds of young people in multiple towns were \u201cinfected.\u201d\nFor six months, the laughing epidemic raged. But then it vanished, never to return. The episode perplexed local health officials. Lab tests and physical examinations had turned up no signs of viral infection. Two doctors who documented the phenomenon concluded \u2014 and later experts agreed \u2014 that the most likely explanation was \u201cmass hysteria.\u201d\n\u201cThe term we use now is mass psychogenic illness, and there are lots of documented cases,\u201d says Nicholas Christakis, MD, PhD, a professor of social and natural science, internal medicine, and biomedical engineering at Yale University.\n\u2018Expectation leads to perception, which becomes reality.\u2019\nIn his book Connected, Christakis describes the 1962 laughing epidemic and other similar episodes. He tells me about a related phenomenon, known as a culture-bound syndrome, where people within a culture experience an illness that exists nowhere else in the world and seems to have no medical basis.\n\u201cThe most famous example comes from Southeast Asia, where men develop this belief that their penis is disappearing and being drawn up into their body,\u201d he says. \u201cTo us this seems nuts, but to those affected the experience is very real.\u201d\nI got in touch with Christakis to talk about the \u201cTikTok tics\u201d reports.\nAccording to a 2021 article in the BMJ journal Archives of Disease in Childhood, clinicians in the U.K. \u201chave recently seen a marked increase in presentations of sudden and new onset of severe tics and \u2018tic-like\u2019 attacks.\u201d The involuntary tics \u2014 exaggerated blinking, throat clearing, verbal outbursts, etc. \u2014 resemble those associated with Tourette syndrome. Researchers in Germany and elsewhere have documented a similar increase.\nWhile tics are usually more common (by a 4:1 ratio) in boys, most of the new cases are showing up in young women. According to that BMJ article, several teenage girls who developed tics reported that they\u2019d been watching videos of people with Tourette\u2019s on TikTok, where tic videos are popular. (As of this writing, #tourettes has almost 6 billion views.) The BMJ authors speculated that the TikTok videos may have contributed to the young people\u2019s tics.\n\u201cThis strikes me as wholly plausible,\u201d Christakis says.\nHow could watching videos online produce symptoms of a neurological disorder? Much of Christakis\u2019s work has examined social contagion theory, or the ways that beliefs spread within groups and are influenced by social interactions, social exposures, and social feedback.\nHe says the rise of online conspiracy theories are one example of internet-assisted social contagion run amok. \u201cPeople with these crazy beliefs can find each other and reinforce each other in a way that wouldn\u2019t happen offline,\u201d he says. Many of the same social forces \u2014 which are often strongest when we\u2019re exposed to \u201cpeers,\u201d or people we regard as like ourselves \u2014 can also influence a person\u2019s physical and emotional health, he says.\nSocial contagion theory argues that our experience of reality \u2014 what we think, what we feel, and how we behave \u2014 is often strongly affected by the thoughts and feelings and behaviors we observe in the people around us, whether online or IRL. If our social relationships signal to our brain that some type of disorder or dysfunction is possible, or even likely, this can increase the odds that we\u2019ll experience its symptoms.\nWhile everyone is under the sway of social forces, Christakis says that young people \u2014 and especially young women \u2014 seem to be more susceptible. \u201cI don\u2019t know why the gendering of this is so strong,\u201d he says. \u201cIt may in part be cultural, but I think there are gender differences in emotional sentiments or calibrations that play a role.\u201d\nIn support of social contagion theory, research has found evidence that symptoms of depression and anxiety can be contagious. Some experts have also argued that depression and other mental health problems that are traditionally considered \u201cnon communicable diseases\u201d should be rebranded as \u201csocially transmitted conditions.\u201d\nWe go too far \u2014 and may be doing real harm \u2014 when we celebrate or reward emotional or physical hardship.\nMore related work involves something known as the nocebo effect.\n\u201cIn the same way the brain\u2019s circuitry can downregulate pain or the severity of other aversive sensations \u2014 that\u2019s the placebo effect \u2014 the brain can also upregulate these sensations, and that\u2019s nocebo effect,\u201d said Vitaly Napadow, PhD, a professor at Harvard Medical School, when we spoke back in 2019.\nFor example, when a person is told a drug they\u2019re taking may lead to depression, upset stomach, or other side-effects \u2014 even if the drug is not associated with any of those \u2014 that person is more likely to report experiencing those side-effects. Research has also found that when people are primed to interpret media content as traumatic, their experience of trauma duly rises.\n\u201cExpectation leads to perception, which becomes reality,\u201d Napadow told me.\nThe authors of the BMJ TikTok study observed something else that may have played a part in the young people\u2019s development of Tourette\u2019s-like symptoms.\nWhen their tics appeared, some of the teens posted videos of their symptoms on social media. This garnered them \u201cpeer support, recognition and a sense of belonging,\u201d the study team wrote. \u201cThis attention and support may be inadvertently reinforcing and maintaining symptoms.\u201d\nOther psychologists, including Christakis, have flagged this problem to me. While getting support and encouragement can be beneficial or even life-saving for people in distress, it may also sustain or exacerbate someone\u2019s condition.\nResearch on people with anorexia has found that grouping them together in recovery wards or day hospitals can lead to relapses or even pro-anorexia beliefs, fueled in part by in-group identification and belonging. Likewise, a 2016 study in the Journal of Affective Disorders found that when people with depression regarded their condition as central to their identity \u2014 something that social media may incentivize \u2014 they were more likely to \u201cconform\u201d to the norms of depressed people, which led to worse outcomes.\nWhile anyone with a health challenge deserves compassion and sympathy, Christakis says we go too far \u2014 and may be doing real harm \u2014 when we celebrate or \u201creward\u201d emotional or physical hardship. \u201cThis is an overcorrection,\u201d he says.\nThe maps of human misery are constantly being redrawn.

A Hidden Brain System\nResearch adds to the complex picture of alcohol and health.\nPhoto by Kinga Cichewicz on Unsplash\nA lot goes wrong with us, and particularly with our brains, when we don\u2019t get enough sleep.\nA single rough night leaves us feeling unfocused and groggy, while chronic poor sleep is a major risk factor for psychological and neurological disorders, including Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\nExperts have long understood that sleep plays a critical role in brain health. But until recently, they\u2019d struggled to explain how poor sleep causes so much trouble. The discovery of a hidden waste-clearance system in the brain may finally provide the answer.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve learned that there are channels in the brain that allow for an influx of fluid that effectively rinses its tissues,\u201d says Ysbrand van der Werf, PhD, a professor of functional neuroanatomy at Amsterdam University Medical Center in the Netherlands. This rinsing helps flush out unwanted cellular garbage, protein aggregates, and other toxins.\n\u201cThese channels are always there, but one of the new insights is that they\u2019re much more open during sleep,\u201d van der Werf says. By some estimates, this waste-clearance system \u2014 which is known as the glymphatic system \u2014 is 10-times more active during deep sleep.\n\u201cTo me, this is the biggest news in recent sleep research,\u201d he adds.\nLow doses of alcohol helped dilate blood vessels and otherwise shift the vasculature of the brain in ways that allowed waste-containing fluid to move more freely.\nOne of the types of junk the glymphatic system removes is a damaging protein that accumulates in the brains of people who have Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve shown in animal models that the glymphatic system is a key player in the transport of amyloid beta out of the brain via the cerebral spinal fluid,\u201d says Iben Lundgaard, PhD, a senior lecturer at Lund University in Sweden.\nLundgaard was part of the research team that first discovered the glymphatic system a decade ago. Her group\u2019s work appears to explain why chronic poor sleep is associated with neurological problems such as Alzheimer\u2019s. Just as a city would gradually cease to function if its trash were left to pile up on street corners, uncleared metabolic garbage seems to slowly clog and suffocate the sleep-deprived brain.\nBut sleep isn\u2019t the only thing that affects glymphatic function. Some of Lundgaard\u2019s more-recent research suggests that modest amounts of alcohol also support the brain\u2019s waste-clearance operations.\nFollowing a dose of alcohol that was equivalent to two standard U.S. drinks, glymphatic activity increased by more than 25 percent, her study found. On the other hand, alcohol in higher doses had just the opposite effect. After the equivalent of eight drinks, glymphatic activity was significantly depressed.\nOther researchers have observed these effects. In 2019, a team at the New Jersey Institute of Technology likewise found that low doses of alcohol seem to promote the clearance of brain waste via the glymphatic system.\nOn its own, this research might not merit much consideration. But prior work has found that people who consume alcohol in moderation may be protected from Alzheimer\u2019s and other brain diseases.\nA 2019 research review found consistent evidence that light-to-moderate drinking is associated with a decreased risk for both Alzheimer\u2019s disease and other forms of dementia. In some cases, light drinking was associated with a more than 50% reduction in Alzheimer\u2019s risk. This trend was reversed among those who drank heavily.\nAll the usual correlation-is-not-causation warnings apply here. But it\u2019s possible that alcohol\u2019s influence on the glymphatic system may partly explain these associations.\n\u2018However significant the observed effects of alcohol on glymphatic function, they would never lead to a recommendation of drinking alcohol for health.\u2019\nHow could alcohol support the glymphatic system? Lundgaard says that\u2019s tricky. \u201cIf alcohol were a drug, we would call it a dirty drug because it has so many different effects, from the receptor level to the system level,\u201d she says.\nBut she\u2019s willing to venture a guess.\nDuring deep sleep, some elements of neurochemical activity mellow in ways that appear to create more space for cerebral spinal fluid to flow through the brain, which facilitates its rinsing and refreshing action. Something like this may also be going on \u2014 to a lesser extent \u2014 when someone drinks a little alcohol. Drinking may relax or otherwise alter neurochemical activity in ways that facilitate glymphatic action, she says.\nIn line with this hypothesis, the New Jersey Institute of Technology researchers found that low doses of alcohol helped dilate blood vessels and otherwise shift the vasculature of the brain in ways that allowed waste-containing fluid to move more freely.\nIt\u2019s important to highlight the limitations of these new findings.\nFor starters, this work involved animals, not people. The process of measuring glymphatic activity is not possible in human brains. (\u201cIt involves taking off a piece of the skull,\u201d Lundgaard told me.)\nHowever, her team assessed alcohol and glymphatic activity in pigs \u2014 an animal whose brain works similarly to a human\u2019s. She says this work, coupled with things that can be studied in people, such as the flow and composition of cerebral spinal fluid as it enters and leaves the brain, indicate that the animal work on glymphatic activity is likely to hold up in humans.\nI know that some people reading this are going to be PO\u2019d at the suggestion that alcohol \u2014 even in small amounts \u2014 could be anything but poison.\nYes, alcohol is habit-forming, and the research is unanimous that alcohol in large quantities is unhealthy. Alcohol may also be uniquely risky if you\u2019re dealing with mental health challenges, which many people are these days. And some work \u2014 notably a 2018 research review in The Lancet \u2014 has concluded that no amount of drinking should be considered safe.\nBut that Lancet study, as some doctors pointed out at the time, actually showed that the risks associated with a drink or two are so vanishingly small as to be irrelevant. Most of the research on light-to-moderate drinking \u2014 usually defined as no more than one drink a day for women or two for men \u2014 has tended to turn up either benefits or insignificant effects.\nI think there\u2019s an eagerness to apply stark good/bad labels to everything we do. Many of us disdain moderation and gravitate toward radical all-or-nothing approaches, usually to our detriment. Lately, alcohol seems to be coming in for this treatment.\nThe point here isn\u2019t that people should drink. The evidence doesn\u2019t support that advice, and no expert would give it. \u201cHowever significant the observed effects of alcohol on glymphatic function, they would never lead to a recommendation of drinking alcohol for health,\u201d says Amsterdam UMC\u2019s van der Werf.\nHowever, if you do drink, this new work seems to fall in line with a lot of prior research. Having a little alcohol now and then seems safe for most adults, and may even turn out to provide health benefits. Heavy drinking is dangerous.

Now I\u2019m peeing again.\nMy urine is clear. (It\u2019s almost always clear.) If I drink another glass or two of water between now and lunchtime, and then five more glasses this afternoon and evening, I\u2019ll have hit the eight-glasses-per-day target that everyone seems to think is the key to health and hydration. I\u2019ll probably pee a dozen more times today.\nUntil recently, I thought I was doing everything right. Water, as the saying goes, is the essence of life. You need it or you die. And if there\u2019s one thing nutrition experts seem to agree on, it\u2019s that dehydration is bad and drinking lots of water is good.\nBut then I read this 2019 study in the journal Nutrients, which discusses the potential risks of overhydration. Its authors argue that drinking too much water is not only wasteful, but that over time it could lead to bladder distention, kidney dysfunction, or other problems. It cites case reports of otherwise healthy people who drank so much water that they developed swollen kidneys or ruptured urinary tracts.\nThe research on longevity and mortality is oddly silent on the subject of water consumption, and experts have called the search for a universal daily water requirement \u201celusive.\u201d\n\u201cUrine is a waste product that helps your body balance its levels of sodium and other electrolytes,\u201d says Tamara Hew-Butler, PhD, first author of that study and an associate professor of exercise physiology at Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan.\nIf you\u2019re peeing all the time and your pee is clear, she says, that\u2019s an indication that you\u2019re drinking more water than your body can use, and so you\u2019re forcing it to dump fluids in order to maintain homeostasis. While that\u2019s unlikely to be a problem in the short-term, keeping that up for years or decades could lead to some of the urinary tract problems outlined in her study.\nThe more I dug through the research, the more it seemed like she had a point.\nJust how much H2O do you need to drink each day for optimal health? The research on hydration is surprisingly inconsistent.\nThere\u2019s the long-standing recommendation \u2014 sometimes called the eight-by-eight rule \u2014 to drink eight, eight-ounce glasses of water each day. But experts have not found solid scientific evidence to support this advice.\n\u201cSaying everyone needs eight glasses of water to be healthy is like saying everyone needs to eat a 2,000-calorie diet,\u201d Hew-Butler says. \u201cI weigh 90 pounds and I spend most of my day sitting inside, but I work with football players who weigh 300 pounds and are exercising all day. Our hydration needs are completely different.\u201d\nShe says the average person needs to replace roughly two liters (or eight cups) of lost fluid each day. But almost anything you drink or eat is going to contain water, which will offset that daily loss. \u201cCoffee, tea, soup, fruits, vegetables \u2014 all of that counts,\u201d she says. (Some work has found that people get an average of 20% of their daily fluids from food alone.)\nAfter collecting samples from more than 300 college athletes, she and her colleagues found that up to 55% were dehydrated based on their pee, but none were dehydrated according to their blood samples.\nMajor health organizations also differ widely in their views on fluid requirements.\nThe European Food Safety Authority advises women and men to consume two liters and 2.5 liters per day, respectively. Meanwhile, the U.S. National Academy of Medicine recommends 2.7 liters for women and 3.5 for men \u2014 or roughly 35\u201340% more than their European counterparts. (And again, both organizations say that all foods and beverages \u2014 not just water \u2014 count toward these daily totals.)\nIt seems like the eight-glasses-a-day maxim has persisted in part because nothing compelling has come along to take its place. The research on longevity and mortality is oddly silent on the subject of water consumption, and experts have called the search for a universal daily water requirement \u201celusive.\u201d\nPart of the difficulty in assessing human hydration needs has to do with how dehydration is measured.\nAnother of Hew-Butler\u2019s studies found that urine-based hydration analyses \u2014 the most common type employed in research \u2014 often don\u2019t align with more accurate blood-based measurements. After collecting samples from more than 300 college athletes, she and her colleagues found that up to 55% were dehydrated based on their pee, but none were dehydrated according to their blood samples.\nThere\u2019s been some well-publicized research showing that even mild dehydration can cause fatigue, headaches, moodiness, or cognitive impairments. But I was surprised to find criticisms of this work. A review in the journal Nutrients argued that these sorts of dehydration studies have produced inconsistent results, and that they often ask people to exercise in hot environments, which could induce fatigue or other symptoms for reasons that have nothing to do with dehydration. (I also found that a lot of dehydration studies have been led by researchers affiliated with Danone or other companies that sell bottled water.)\nMeanwhile, research in the journal Nutrition Reviews has concluded that overhydration \u201cmay not be as benign as is usually assumed.\u201d\nThere is no doubt that dehydration is dangerous. Our thirst reflexes tend to decline as we age, and dehydration is a common and serious health problem among the elderly \u2014 one that can worsen a number of age-related medical conditions.\nThere\u2019s also no question that drinking water is generally good for you, and that swigging it in place of sugar-sweetened beverages can reduce your risk for metabolic and cardiovascular diseases.\nBut if, like me, you assumed there\u2019s no downside to drinking lots of water \u2014 that going to the bathroom 15 times a day is a sign of proper hydration \u2014 the research to date doesn\u2019t endorse this view. It\u2019s possible that by flooding my digestive plumbing with unneeded H20, I may be asking for a swollen bladder, worn-out kidneys, or other urinary tract issues.\nFinally, there\u2019s the environmental cost of excessive water consumption.\nWater is a precious resource. Energy is needed to purify it so that it\u2019s potable. Many of us prefer our water bottled, and all that plastic adds up; the U.S. goes through 28 billion plastic water bottles a year. \u201cIf you\u2019re worried about climate change, why would you drink more water than you need?\u201d Hew-Butler asks.\nShe recommends drinking water when you feel thirsty. \u201cListen to your body,\u201d she says. \u201cIt will tell you if you\u2019re drinking too little.\u201d If you notice your urine is dark yellow, that\u2019s also a good indicator that you need a drink.\nWater is good for you.

A moment that drove the final nail in the festering, noxious coffin of call-out culture. A wake-up call for an entire generation of internet users, too many of whom view cyberbullying as an ordinary and inevitable part of everyday life in cyberspace. It was supposed to be a reminder that the personalities we interact with daily on social media are real people with real problems, and that it\u2019s always best to approach online disagreements with as much prudence and civility as possible. Judging by recent events, however, Ames\u2019 tragic death doesn\u2019t appear to have had the impact some predicted.\nAfter sharing her feelings about working with \u201ccrossover performers\u201d (men who perform in scenes with both men and women) in the adult film industry, Ames became the target of a vengeful online mob. Two days later, she committed suicide. After her death, it was revealed that Ames had been struggling with depression and bipolar disorder for quite some time.\nThe verbal abuse Ames endured is not uncommon. \u201cCalling out\u201d problematic behavior on the internet has become something of a gladiator sport, frequently pitting hordes of merciless online activists against a single, unsuspecting soul. And while it\u2019s true that such call-outs are occasionally deserved, it\u2019s also plainly obvious that the ferociousness of call-out culture\u2019s most zealous disciples is becoming increasingly disproportionate to the alleged offenses of their victims. For a textbook example, look no further than the recent controversy surrounding a young woman\u2019s decision to wear a cheongsam (a Chinese-style dress) to her high school prom.\nI\u2019ll admit I cringed a bit when I first saw pictures of Keziah Daum in her prom dress. Maybe I reacted negatively because I thought the dress was inappropriate. Or, maybe I reacted that way because I could predict the unwarranted backlash. Perhaps it was a little of both. Regardless of our reaction, a young high school student with no malicious intent does not deserve a rabid social media mob. But somehow, that\u2019s always what happens.\nLike many of those who attacked August Ames without any consideration for her mental and emotional health, many of Daum\u2019s critics appeared unconcerned with the harm they were inflicting. Fortunately, she handled the situation remarkably well for someone so young. But what if, like Ames, Daum had been suffering from some form of mental illness? What if the mob had unintentionally pushed her beyond an invisible psychological threshold? Would the members of that mob be as quick to hold themselves accountable for their behavior as they were to hold Daum accountable for what was, at worst, a benign faux pas?\nThese are the questions fans of Cartoon Network\u2019s Steven Universe grappled with after the attempted suicide of a young fan artist who was known for experimenting with the physical appearance of her favorite characters. Fans of the show criticized her art as racist, fatphobic, ableist, transphobic, along with various other phobias and isms that you probably never even knew existed. Entire blogs were created for the sole purpose of attacking her and her work. The vitriol was astonishing.\nNot to be outdone, though, fans of Dream Daddy, a dating simulator released in July of last year, targeted an artist who had the audacity to flip the genders of the game\u2019s seven main characters. For this historic transgression, the artist in question was subjected to accusations of transphobia, as well as a deluge of hate mail and death threats.\nIt goes without saying that every work of art is bound to offend someone. That\u2019s the nature of art. But neither of the aforementioned artists were the first to play around with the identities and appearances of established fictional characters \u2014 and you can bet they won\u2019t be the last. While their work is certainly open to criticism, we can\u2019t excuse or rationalize this level of sustained, unchecked animosity.\nCall-out culture justifies itself by claiming to dissuade individuals from engaging in behaviors that many people (progressives, especially) deem unacceptable. Though it may have once served a constructive purpose, call-out culture has since morphed into the online equivalent of road rage. It encourages dangerous overreactions to perceived offenses, many of which are too innocuous to warrant a reaction at all.\nAt its core, call-out culture is a manifestation of the herd mentality. One of the features of this mentality \u2014 and the one that may be the most responsible for call-out culture\u2019s expansion \u2014 is perhaps best characterized as a \u201cdiffusion of responsibility.\u201d We don\u2019t believe we can be individually held responsible for the behavior of a group. Combine this mentality with virtue signaling on steroids, and you have the perfect conditions for the worst aspects of contemporary internet culture.\nIn this way, call-out culture itself is at least as toxic as the behavior it was meant to combat. It favors treating alleged offenders like irredeemable criminals. It breeds antipathy towards mercy and forgiveness. It temporarily transforms otherwise reasonable, well-intentioned individuals into busybodies who take great pleasure in humiliating and ostracizing others. And in the case of August Ames, it even contributed to the death of an innocent person.\nIt\u2019s safe to say that call-out culture deserves nothing less than its long-overdue demise. There are better ways of dealing with the misunderstandings, disagreements and divisions that inevitably arise in diverse societies like ours. Call-out culture only exacerbates the worst in us, which is why we would all be better off without it.", "comment_count": 30, "like_count": 4580, "created_time": 1526080177869, "comment": [{"user_id": "1cb34d17de22", "comment_time": 1526080177869, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "667a618fc5bb", "comment_time": 1526234820162, "comment": "What an amazing article.

Licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0.\nTo anyone who recognizes the immense responsibility that rests on the collective shoulders of America\u2019s criminal defense attorneys, Senator Ted Cruz\u2019s allegation that our nation\u2019s public defenders care a bit too much about their clients might sound more than a little bizarre. The unfortunate reality, however, is that America has never really taken seriously its constitutional duty to ensure that every defendant in its care receives the due process to which they are entitled. Cruz\u2019s attitude reflects that reality, and it\u2019s why he so grossly misunderstands the passion that public defenders bring to their profession.\nIf Senator Cruz is truly concerned with preserving the integrity of the criminal justice system, he ought to spend a little less time worrying about America\u2019s overworked, underpaid public defenders and spend a little more time worrying about the opportunistic, self-serving prosecutors who have brought shame to courtrooms all across the country.\nFor generations, our justice system has been infested with rogue prosecutors who, for the sake of advancing their own careers, have robbed countless innocent people of their freedom. In 2020, the National Registry of Exonerations released a damning study that showcased the link between official misconduct and wrongful convictions. It found that prosecutorial misconduct had played a role in 30% of the 2,400 wrongful convictions on which the study was based.\nDisappointingly, rogue prosecutors rarely face any meaningful consequences for their criminality. A survey conducted by the Innocence Project and Veritas Initiative found 660 cases of prosecutorial misconduct in five different states between 2004 and 2008, yet only one of the prosecutors involved in those cases received any discipline at all.\nSimilarly, in 2010, a USA Today investigation into 201 cases of misconduct involving federal prosecutors revealed that only one prosecutor had been \u201cbarred even temporarily from practicing law.\u201d Citing privacy concerns, the Justice Department refused to reveal that prosecutor\u2019s name.\nOne potential explanation for why prosecutorial misconduct is such a pervasive and seemingly unsolvable problem is that criminal defense attorneys haven\u2019t had a voice on the Supreme Court in over 30 years. The last justice to have worked as a criminal defense attorney was Justice Thurgood Marshall, who retired in 1991.\nProsecutors, on the other hand, haven\u2019t encountered the same professional barriers that have kept criminal defense attorneys off the Supreme Court for the past three decades. Today, the Court counts three former prosecutors among its ranks \u2014 Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Neil Gorsuch, and Samuel Alito.\nThe Supreme Court has long needed the perspective and insights that only a justice with experience as a public defender can provide. It needs someone who is intimately familiar with the dynamics of a criminal justice system that has stacked the deck against marginalized defendants; someone who has both the will and the expertise to identify the institutional defects that have allowed scores of rogue prosecutors to escape accountability for their ethical bankruptcy; and someone who understands that just outcomes aren\u2019t possible without just processes, processes that are designed to restrain the worst impulses of the judges, prosecutors, and law enforcement officials with whom we\u2019ve entrusted tremendous institutional power and authority.\nPresident Biden finally found that person. Her name is Ketanji Brown Jackson, and her historic confirmation to the Supreme Court is an unmitigated victory for every American who supports a more equitable, impartial, and fair-minded criminal justice system.", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 0, "created_time": 1649422719158, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Supreme Court", "Ketanji Brown Jackson", "Criminal Justice", "Politics", "Republicans"]}, {"author": "D.A.

Licensed under CC BY-SA 2.0.\nWhen you\u2019re a public figure, nearly every choice you make is analyzed, discussed, and debated. The outfits you choose to wear to your favorite bars and clubs; your responses to the admirers you encounter on the streets; the contrition you choose to show \u2014 or not show \u2014 when your misdeeds are caught on camera and broadcast on TV for the entire world to see; rightly or wrong, these kinds of choices are considered fair game for scrutiny by fans and critics alike.\nSometimes, those choices are applauded. Sometimes, they\u2019re condemned. And sometimes, they\u2019re turned into the butt of a joke.\nWill Smith\u2019s inexcusable decision to slap Chris Rock at this year\u2019s Oscars is a fine example of a poor choice that deserves all the scrutiny and mockery it\u2019s received. You can argue that the volume of negative attention being paid to this incident is entirely disproportionate to the significance of the slap itself. You can argue that Rock was right to refrain from pressing charges, and that he and Smith can reconcile their differences like civilized men without needlessly involving the police. And you can even argue that Smith preemptively earned himself a second chance by behaving like a stand-up citizen and role model throughout his adult life.\nBut you cannot argue that he was right to slap Chris Rock. No matter how his supporters try to spin it, there\u2019s simply no justification for the way he behaved, as Smith himself has already acknowledged.\nEveryone understands that intense public scrutiny is one of the many prices that celebrities like Will Smith must pay for their fame. At the same time, there has always been a line that many people don\u2019t believe should be crossed, a line that\u2019s drawn between the poor choices that famous people sometimes make and the unfortunate burdens that all people, including the rich and famous, are sometimes forced to endure through no fault of their own.\nSmith\u2019s behavior falls into the former category. He made a poor choice of his own free will and has been relentlessly mocked, ridiculed, and criticized over it. Jada Pinkett Smith did not, however, choose to be burdened with alopecia, which places her firmly in the latter category and raises an important question.\nIs it fair to wonder whether Chris Rock\u2019s joke might have crossed the line, or perhaps come a little too close to it?\nThe answer, I believe, is yes.\nBefore I go any further, let me just state for the record that I\u2019m a big fan of Chris Rock. I don\u2019t believe the man has a mean bone anywhere in his body, and that there was no malicious intent at all behind his joke about Pinkett Smith\u2019s hair.\nFurthermore, even if the joke was inappropriate, I\u2019d argue that it was so mild, so tame, and so forgettable that it probably doesn\u2019t warrant a public apology (though it might be a good idea for Rock to offer Pinkett Smith a private apology, assuming she\u2019s open to receiving one).\nNevertheless, I don\u2019t agree with all the comedians trying to pass the joke off as completely harmless and implying that there\u2019s no good reason whatsoever for either Will or Jada to be the slightest bit upset about it.\nLast Friday, during his Real Time show on HBO, Bill Maher had plenty to say about the controversy. And to be honest, I agreed with much of what he had to say \u2014 but he lost me when he tried to downplay the severity of Pinkett Smith\u2019s condition.\n\u201cIf you are so lucky in life as to have that be your medical problem, just say \u2018thank God,\u2019\u201d he said. He also pointed out that alopecia isn\u2019t as serious as cancer, a comparison that is in no way relevant to the question of whether Rock\u2019s joke was over the line. The appropriateness of a joke about someone\u2019s health doesn\u2019t hinge on whether that person is in any mortal danger.\nWhat it should hinge on, in my humble opinion, is whether the person in question has made it clear that they have no objections to jokes about their medical condition.\nIf Pinkett Smith had at some point made it perfectly clear that she didn\u2019t mind people joking about her alopecia, I\u2019d be in the same camp as all the aforementioned comedians who are treating Rock\u2019s joke as a harmless ribbing. The thing is, Pinkett Smith has spoken before about her battle with alopecia, and it\u2019s clearly been a very unpleasant experience for her. Of course, that shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise to anyone. In an industry as superficial as Hollywood, any physical feature that deviates from accepted standards of beauty is bound to make life difficult for women like her.\nBefore you follow in Maher\u2019s footsteps and dismiss Pinkett Smith\u2019s struggles with alopecia as a trivial circumstance, ask yourself this: if baldness is no big deal, why do American men spend over a billion dollars per year trying to fight it? The answer, of course, is that American culture is no less superficial than Hollywood culture. We are obsessed with physical appearances, and that obsession has made most of us much more self-conscious than we otherwise would be, hence why so many men are so easily duped by the false promises of myriad over-the-counter hair loss treatments.\nAny medical condition that imposes any sort of suffering on its victim \u2014 be it physical, psychological, or emotional suffering \u2014 is serious enough to warrant at least some caution on the part of any person who wants to joke about it. It all comes down to respect. If you respect someone\u2019s suffering, you shouldn\u2019t risk adding to that suffering by making it the butt of a questionable joke. You should instead take the time to eliminate that risk, either by making sure that the person is comfortable with your joke, or by choosing to keep that joke to yourself.\nAccording to TMZ, Chris Rock didn\u2019t know about Jada\u2019s alopecia. If that report is accurate, it would be quite a stretch to try and argue that Rock deliberately disrespected her or her suffering. But what if he had known about her condition and proceeded to joke about it anyway before making sure she was cool with it? Could we then say that he had crossed a line?\nThat\u2019s a sincere question, not a rhetorical one. And it\u2019s a question that I think deserves its own discussion.", "comment_count": 1, "like_count": 50, "created_time": 1649179240095, "comment": [{"user_id": "1cb34d17de22", "comment_time": 1649179240095, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "57ce30414fc1", "comment_time": 1649252324203, "comment": "If he knew, he crossed a line."}], "post_tag": ["Jada Pinkett Smith", "Chris Rock", "Will Smith", "Comedy", "Entertainment"]}, {"author": "D.A.

I enjoyed testing boundaries and had no fear of injury or death.

As soon as I felt it burrowing up the back of my throat, I did what any good Catholic boy would do; I placed my hands over my mouth and let nature take its course.\nWhat followed was a perfectly normal sneeze. It sounded normal. It felt normal. In fact, everything about it was normal \u2014 except for the tiny speck of blood that appeared in the palm of my right hand.\nAt that moment, something went terribly wrong. I sat in my desk, overwhelmed with a fear that I\u2019d never felt before. My mind was racing at the speed of light, and my heart wasn\u2019t far behind it. I panicked, glanced up at my teacher, darted across the room toward her desk, and begged her to let me go to the nurse\u2019s office. She obliged me, but with just enough hesitation to communicate her disappointment and frustration with my out-of-character behavior. And I understood, even at my young age, that I was overreacting.\nYet for some inexplicable reason, I couldn\u2019t stop myself.\nI was experiencing an existential dread that made no sense to me at all. I knew I wasn\u2019t going to die, but I felt like I was already dying. I knew I wasn\u2019t acting rationally, but I felt certain that I was doing what any rational person would do in my place.\nThe nurse seemed at first to be much more sympathetic to my situation than my teacher had been. She listened calmly as I explained what happened and showed her the speck of dried blood on my palm. She then asked me a few standard questions, took my temperature, and told me she\u2019d return in a minute or two before exiting the room and gently closing the door behind her.\nAnd return she did, but with the notoriously strict Sister Anne \u2014 the school principal \u2014 in tow.\nSister Anne got straight to the point. \u201cThe next time you come crying to the nurse about something like this,\u201d she explained, \u201cI\u2019m going to suspend you from school for a whole day and have your parents come pick you up.\u201d Then she apologized to the nurse on my behalf, grabbed me by the arm, yanked me out of that office, and escorted me back to class.\nFor the next month, I cried myself to sleep every night believing that my death was imminent. I was terrified and confused, and I\u2019d no idea who to turn to for help. I didn\u2019t trust anyone \u2014 not my parents, not my teachers, and certainly not Sister Anne. All I could do was pray, so that\u2019s what I did. I prayed every morning, for weeks on end, asking God to let me die at school and not at home. I didn\u2019t want my parents to see me in my last moments. I knew they couldn\u2019t handle it.\nIt took weeks before momentum shifted in favor of the rational side of my brain and the near-constant knot in my stomach began to unwind itself. But eventually, the fear of my no-longer-inevitable death had subsided completely, and my youthful sense of invincibility was fully restored.\nThis was, I believe, my first brush with obsessive-compulsive disorder, a condition with which I\u2019d be diagnosed about 8 years after this episode.\nThere\u2019s a very small part of me that wants to hate Sister Anne and the school nurse for what they did to me. I don\u2019t know if the way they treated me caused me any permanent harm, but I\u2019m darn sure it didn\u2019t help. At best, their response to my first-ever OCD episode had shattered my perception of school as a safe, comfortable environment where I could ask for help whenever I needed it. At worst, it had discouraged me from opening up about other obsessive fears that would haunt me later in life, fears so debilitating that I\u2019d eventually take up temporary residence in a psychiatric clinic for severely troubled juveniles.\nNevertheless, I can\u2019t bring myself to hold a grudge towards Sister Anne or the school nurse. For one thing, it\u2019s almost certain that they\u2019ve both passed away by now, and I\u2019m not one to wish ill upon the dead.\nFurthermore, I know that they were just following the same scare-them-straight approach to childhood discipline that was likely used on them when they were kids. As damaging as that approach may have been, it was a pillar of Catholic culture when I was growing up. In the halls of the average Catholic school, Christ\u2019s love almost always played second fiddle to tough love.\nBut that excuse doesn\u2019t fly in 2022.\nOCD is much more well-understood today than it was when I was a child, and no respected psychiatrist would ever prescribe Sister Anne\u2019s tough-love discipline as an effective treatment for it. The same can be said about myriad psychological and neurological disorders that are frequently \u2014 and incorrectly \u2014 attributed to immaturity, narcissism, laziness, or some other deficiency of character.\nAccountability takes many forms, but not all forms of accountability are equally effective or appropriate. That\u2019s especially true when you\u2019re dealing with a mentally ill child whose well-being depends in part on having a network of trustworthy and compassionate adults with whom they can be open and honest. Mentally ill kids don\u2019t need more spankings, groundings, or anxiety-inducing threats from old-school disciplinarians like Sister Anne. They need loving, empathetic elders who can teach them how to navigate a world that isn\u2019t built for them, doesn\u2019t understand them, and all too often holds them in contempt for the crime of being different.\nIf you\u2019re a parent whose child regularly misbehaves in ways that you suspect might be symptomatic of mental illness, don\u2019t make the same mistake Sister Anne and the school nurse made with me. Your child doesn\u2019t need your tough love; they need your unconditional love. Please don\u2019t jeopardize their future by stubbornly clinging to the antiquated notion that a balanced diet of fear, intimidation, and punishment can cure a malfunctioning brain. Instead, get your child the professional help that too many other mentally ill children never received when they needed it the most \u2014 and get it now, before it\u2019s too late.", "comment_count": 5, "like_count": 606, "created_time": 1648761237467, "comment": [{"user_id": "1cb34d17de22", "comment_time": 1648761237467, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "833fd124dcaa", "comment_time": 1648822369100, "comment": "You are exactly right.

As an adult, I was glad to see characters that spoke to me long ago getting a new lease on life as film technology reached the point that it could recreate the visual spectacle I once cherished on the page.\nNow I just can\u2019t love them any more. Vigilantism and power fantasies, garnished with quips and winks. A glossy spectacle of garish fun with a sinister underlying message.\nA fair number of these heroes are mass murderers. Black Widow is a trained assassin with an enormous body count. Who cares? Black Widow is a hero. Hawkeye on Disney Plus reminds us that Clint Barton also killed hundreds. A scowly look or throwaway line about it is effectively brushed aside. It\u2019s totally okay because they were all bad people. We think. It\u2019s not like arrow guy invests a lot of screen time in collecting evidence to make sure he\u2019s choosing the right targets, and if the mobster\u2019s entourage included under cover police officers collecting evidence to make a legal case in court by the book, well it sucks to be collateral damage. Vigilantes are always a thousand percent more interested in the dispensing of revenge violence than they are with little things like collecting evidence, being sure they have the right target, proportionality, or ancilliary impacts. Due process is for losers without costumes. Thor has killed more than enough people to fill a city, but it\u2019s boisterous good fun and isn\u2019t he handsome?\nJeffrey Dahmer may have eaten seventeen people, but beside these cultural icons he\u2019s strictly an amateur in the body count department. Maybe if he looked like Scarlet Johansson we\u2019d have just given him a medal and a new fork.\nThe Marvel universe is a libertarian fantasy where simply having power means you are authorized to use it however you like.\nIn Wandavision, Wanda Maximoff simply takes over an entire town, reprograms their brains, and uses them as her playthings while, you know, she\u2019s working out some stuff. When we see her in the trailer for the next Doctor Strange, she hastens to mention that she understands this might have been a bit out of line, and he brushes right past it because he needs her help. Can\u2019t make an omelette without willingness to break the entire space time continuum and endanger not just the entire universe, but an infinite number of them, right? Strange promises Wong that he won\u2019t cast the spell that can needlessly imperil all of reality as we know it, and then winks to Spider Man to show us he was only lying, and of course he will. What a scamp!\nIf the good guys do it, it was totally justified, or the villain\u2019s fault because they made it necessary, or a lapse in judgement that we shouldn\u2019t hold over them in the aftermath lest another bogeyman pop up. You could tell by the poster even before you walked into the theatre. If you find yourself thinking too clearly about the moral implications behind the primary colours character notes, don\u2019t worry: there\u2019ll be a frenetic CGI punch-up between many polygons to take your mind off of it in the third act.\nIron Man\u2019s an arms dealer who declares that \u201cI came to realize that I have more to offer this world than just making things that blow up\u201d and then \u2026 makes a crazy bunch more things that blow stuff up. I mean, sure, he created Ultron, who represented an extermination threat for all of humanity, but that doesn\u2019t mean that he should be subjected to any kind of consequence or oversight at all, at all. Why allow any public agency or democratically elected government or concept of jurisprudence to get in the way of letting him do it again and again? Why shouldn\u2019t one solitary billionaire have personal control over a way to obliterate privacy or easily kill anyone on the planet, and then randomly bequeath that obscene power to a high schooler upon his death? Tony\u2019s the good guy.\nSo here\u2019s the thing. Jeffrey Dahmer doesn't see himself as the bad guy either. In his head, he\u2019s the misunderstood hero of his own story. Violence against the Hatfields enrages them to take revenge on the McCoys, who reliably follow suit, and a thousand generations later it\u2019s as intractable as the Middle East. Hyperpolarization tells us that people on the other side of the political aisle are the bad guys and we\u2019re the good guys, so why is anyone surprised to see a steadily growing third of Americans feeling political violence is justified? Feel like organizing a coup attempt? Consequences will only land on the lowly foot soldiers, a judicial slap on the wrist for the Orange Skull\u2019s legion of goon followers while he plans the sequel.\nPut it on screen and give your scary immigrant purple skin and a weapon of mass destruction and audiences will line up around the block to fanboy at your xenophobic story nonstop.\nI thought for a while that Iron Man was just a poster child for billionaire unaccountability. Facebook aids and abets genocide in Myanmar, Zuckerberg pretends to act human in front of some committee, he makes promises that mean nothing whatsoever, and then Facebook is still where armed insurrection is planned in public. Rinse and repeat. Ho hum, just another Ultron, so why are you wasting Iron Man\u2019s time by getting up in his grill about it? Don\u2019t you know he\u2019s got stupid risks to take with all of our lives while you\u2019re busy boring him with congressional hearings?\nBut it\u2019s bigger than that. The Marvel ethic of \u201caren\u2019t you glad I was here to put out that fire that I started?\u201d is America itself. The United States is also a libertarian fantasy where simply having power means you are authorized to use it however you like, pretty much. Arming and training the Taliban is just another Ultron. Helping Saddan Hussein to gas Iran is an Ultron. Training and arming death squads to oppress democracy in Chile? In Argentina? But Tony meant well! His intentions were good as he understood things at the time, and that makes it all totally okay.\nDon\u2019t let the body count get in the way of going all squee over his awesome robot suit of mass destruction. Might makes right as long as you look cool. History is written by the winners and their irrepressible wit.\nDon\u2019t forget to buy the toy.\nThere\u2019s a lot of powerful diverse writers on Medium.

Economic precarity is trauma. The pandemic is trauma. Increasingly violent political hyperpolarization is trauma. Climate chaos is trauma. Warfare is trauma. At this point, I think it\u2019s realistic to consider everyone we encounter to be traumatized. Even infants pick up on the emotional states of their caretakers.\nIn moments of crisis, our most basic responses are fight, flight, or paralysis. The limitless belligerence of the extreme right is a fight response, but motivated climate activism by the evidence-responsive is also a (far healthier) form of fight response. A retreat into a confirmation bias media bubble when confronted with ideas that threaten you is a flight response, but so is a wholly rational desire not to expose yourself to a maskless Covid superspreader event. Depression can feel much like paralysis, and trying to decide what course of action might work best to address your concerns without inadvertently making things worse can also feel like paralysis. Your mileage will vary.\nAll of those things take energy. Fight, flight, and paralysis can all be exhausting. Trauma is exhausting. A neverending barrage of it every time we look at our news feed is doubly so. If you\u2019re not feeling at least intermittently depleted, I imagine it can only be because you\u2019re privileged enough to not have to pay attention to what\u2019s happening in the world around you. For the rest of us, we feel we\u2019re running on fumes.\nIt makes the victim blaming productivity pressure our culture has so normalized even more toxic than normal when we face it in that state.\nWe simply can\u2019t do it all. And we shouldn\u2019t have to try. Burnout is a real problem.\nFallow time is necessary self care.\nSo a part of how I\u2019m dealing with feeling overwhelmed is through better managing my expectations, and taking baby steps.\nIf I don\u2019t have the energy to clean the whole room, I might only clear the table top. Accessing that work surface at that moment is the urgent part. When the mound of dishes is too daunting, I\u2019ll wash the handful of things I\u2019m likeliest to want to use again. I want my favourite spatula for assembling dinner, and the tea infuser for breakfast, but there\u2019s plenty of other mugs in which I could steep that morning cuppa. I might be proud of what I produce when I press myself to write something new almost every day, but it\u2019s okay if I dial it back for a while and only write when I feel inspired with something to say.\nI don\u2019t have to do everything. It\u2019s impossible. But I can do something. A journey of a thousand miles takes place one step at a time, and they steadily add up.\nI don\u2019t have to spike the football in the end zone on every play. Getting a couple of yards closer is still movement in the right direction. Celebrating that as a form of success is a game changer for me in the trauma department.\nSome responsibilities don\u2019t afford us that luxury. A work deadline is still a deadline. Not cleaning the litter box for a few days imposes its own consequences. Offspring must be fed, fires must be put out. We have to rise to those occasions every time.\nSometimes there\u2019s no next time, no do-overs, no second chances and no later. The best your depleted self can muster has got to hit the mark because failing to do so is too costly. Do or die comes along, and not answering the door when it arrives isn\u2019t a tenable option.\nBut being kind to ourselves about the rest of it, the other duties that we self impose, or that sound like a nagging relative living rent free in our consciousness, enables us to do so more effectively.\nThe little steps, the minor wins, the incremental gains, they add up. They may feel paltry, but they are successes. 1% always beats 0% hands down. Just 1% a day becomes 2%, then 3%, reliably inching towards 100.\nBuild on every even tiny success.\nWith the biggest, most important things, incrementalism is the best we can personally do. I can\u2019t single handedly stop the spread of the new XE variant, but I can reduce how much I contribute to that spread. I can\u2019t unilaterally stop greenhouse gas emissions, but I can own responsibility for my personal choices. I can\u2019t make the world a kinder safer place for everyone, but I can reach out to a neighbour who needs help.\nThose are lessons in scale. The laws of physics don\u2019t care if we find climate action palatable or convenient. They\u2019re going to cook our future prospects if we don\u2019t do enough no matter how we justify inaction to ourselves. But I can\u2019t contain and process responsibility for the whole thing. I can do something. I have to. I can respond to the evidence about where the breaking point is. I can encourage others to do the same, but my power there is limited, too.\nIt has to be okay with me that my personal power is limited. As long as I use my limited power to do the little that I can do as well as I can do it, that\u2019s my obligation met.\nSo celebrate every. little. success. Life isn\u2019t a sprint, and burnout awaits making it one.\nSlow and steady. Day by day. Dish by dish. Moment by moment.\nAnd when I don\u2019t browbeat myself into trying to do everything in my day, and I pause to partake of something that makes me laugh or take pictures of wildlife in my neighbourhood or savour the leftovers for dinner when I lack the oomph to cook something new, I recharge my batteries a little for tackling the pots in the sink tomorrow. I\u2019m healthier, even if I can\u2019t muster my way all the way to healthy. And I\u2019m inevitably better company.\nBe kind to yourself.\nFinding Gratitude at the End of the World\nAs we wade through endless crap, maybe you\u2019d like to hear about some upsides.sustainablesong.medium.com\nCivilization Is A Team Sport\nExpanding our definition of \u201cus\u201d is a survival trait.sustainablesong.medium.com\nThere\u2019s a lot of powerful diverse writers on Medium.

They\u2019re inextricably connected. Both suck.\nTwo at once doesn\u2019t mean double the risk. They magnify one another, squaring the risk.\nBoth are stupid. Stupid is killing us. And getting better at it.\nCovid means brain damage on repeat.\nIt\u2019s got a bigger arsenal than that, of course. It kills some, damages hearts, damages lungs, causes blood clots, and increases diabetes risks. Long Covid can involve hundreds of different symptoms and change the way it presents. It\u2019s a frickin\u2019 nightmare of hazards. But I want to focus on just two dire facts:\nAt least a quarter of Covid infections result in brain damage, even among mild or asymptomatic cases.\nPeople are catching Covid repeatedly, and repeat infections may have cumulative effects.\nPut those two things together and a grim picture emerges. People catching Covid over and over again, potentially suffering more severe cumulative neurological impacts. A profound steady decline in human intelligence, rippling back and forth through the population.\nNow that most testing has stopped, we won\u2019t see the next waves coming. Nor will we spot approaching new variants, of which we\u2019re guaranteed to see more. Note that each new variant has been progressively more infectious.\nThere is no reason to expect later variants to be less dangerous. Viruses don\u2019t do that. Polio and smallpox never became less dangerous during the thousands of years they killed us. Rabies hasn't become any less virulent. Measles and Dengue fever haven\u2019t become any milder.\nBut even if this was through some utterly unlikely miracle as bad as it got, it would still be grinding human intelligence downwards. Think about how insufferable and dangerous ignorance can be. Now imagine average human intelligence steadily trending downward at an accelerated rate. Year after year.\nThat\u2019s only half of our plague of idiot problem.\nThe reason I know you won\u2019t have any trouble imagining how completely a plague of idiots can screw us is that we already had one before Covid got here. You\u2019ve surely noticed.\nThe word idiot derives from the same Greek root \u2014 meaning solitary or set apart \u2014 as the word idiosyncrasy: a behaviour specific to one solitary individual. To the ancient Greeks, an idiotes was someone who didn't participate in the great experiment of community building through democracy. They didn't see themselves as a part of their community, didn't feel engaged with its well being, and weren't sufficiently informed to have a credible or useful opinion on civic matters.\nSound familiar? Refusing to endure even the most minor inconvenience to save lives in your community is a textbook-quality example of that original definition of idiocy: not caring about your community.\nA mighty legion of them in the public is mirrored by similar idiotes they\u2019ve elected to office, penalizing and undermining efforts to protect our collective well being simultaneously from above and below. For policy, they offer angry contrarianism. They listen carefully to what all our top experts tell us we need for public safety or quality education or to avoid global catastrophe and then furiously insist we do the opposite. Every damned time.\nAnd let\u2019s be clear: the idiots have won. We aren\u2019t trying to contain the virus any more. We\u2019ve discarded masks and social distancing and occupancy limits. We\u2019ve tossed children into cramped and stuffy petri dish classrooms. We\u2019ve had vaccines for more than a year but only one percent of the Democratic Republic of the Congo has had even one dose. Our doses provide only declining protection for the same reason that the Tylenol you took yesterday doesn\u2019t protect you from a new headache today.\nStatistics Canada tells us that 38% of Canadians are at heightened risk, but we don\u2019t care. Omicron hospitalizes children at four times the rate of Delta. Sucks to be them. Maybe if they wanted not to be exposed to a serious unprecedented disease they should have planned ahead and chosen to be born to rich parents who could afford to send them to private schools that have the only remaining mask mandates.\nThat\u2019s where we are as a civilization. The idiotes that can\u2019t be convinced to give a crap about the well being of anyone around them have successfully decided for everyone else that we\u2019re going to suffer wave upon wave of brain damage through the population.\nInequality and desperation drives people to those hateful views as their frustration with never being able to get ahead curdles into rage, and runaway inflation escalates it. Peer reviewed research also connects lower intelligence with the embrace of right wing ideology, so perhaps politicos cheerleading for widespread contagion while branding it freedom are also counting on it as a recruiting tool.\nSo what\u2019s our best outcome here?\nI\u2019m personally of the opinion that we should value lives, and that we should have strangled the virus in its crib before we reached this point. Once that opportunity was squandered, I would have preferred that we learned from the second wave, or the third, or the fourth, or the fifth. Now we\u2019re opening the door wide. Public health care systems have already suffered irreversible damage and will be further crippled, never the same again in our lifetimes.\nMaybe the next variant will be deadlier, and the death toll will mount well beyond what we\u2019ve seen. Maybe it will just continue to get better at evading our defences and whittle away at us an infection at a time, condemning millions to worsening lifelong disability. It\u2019s all going to happen across a backdrop of escalating warfare, accelerating climate chaos, and economic disruption.\nSo are there any potential silver linings anywhere in here? Can we find any glint of hope in this now inescapable tragedy?\nThe fact that the extreme right is more eager to expose itself to Covid risks means that they may disproportionately suffer the worst of the pandemic. More importantly, I am hopeful that watching them sacrifice the lives that are about to be lost and diminished will turn more citizens away from them in moral disgust than are drawn to them by callousness and schadenfreude.\nBut for the natural world around us, the rich and varied biosphere we\u2019re dragging into the sixth mass extinction against its will, perhaps the glimmer of hope is the possibility that humanity turning on itself may reduce the size of our collective ecological footprint. For loved ones, every human loss is a tragedy, but for the biosphere, our teeming multitudes are just hastening its demise.\nThere\u2019s a lot of powerful diverse writers on Medium.

Prices affect consumer behaviour. If you own a movie theatre, you\u2019ll fill more seats if tickets only cost five dollars than if you crank them up to $50. It\u2019s not hard to understand.\nThis behaviour is why we have what are sometimes referred to as \u201csin taxes.\u201d In Canada, where health care is publicly funded and universally delivered (because you get better care more cheaply that way every single time), the public cost of lung cancer treatment for smokers is significant. Sin taxes on cigarette sales raise the cost of the habit. Smoking rates resultingly go down. Discouraging smoking saves money and improves public health.\nThat\u2019s the whole point.\nEconomists demand climate action, too.\n95% of economists agree that we have to urgently cut emissions to maintain global economic stability. 60 central banks from around the world agree that climate change is a clear and present danger to our entire financial system. The International Monetary Fund agrees with them.\nNobel Prize winning economist Nicholas Stern calls it \u201cthe greatest market failure in history.\u201d Economists at the World Bank estimate that the world is risking $158 trillion dollars in losses \u2014 that\u2019s about twice the entire world\u2019s total annual economic output\u2014 by 2050. The economic picture worsens by the day. It\u2019s why the insurance industry \u2014 whose profit margins are directly dependant upon effective risk assessment \u2014 calls it \u201cthe mother of all risks.\u201d\nThat\u2019s without considering non-financial risks like the collapse of our food supply, a lot more wars and interpersonal violence, and what every organization of medical professionals calls the greatest health risk of this century. Just the economics should be enough to get us to take it seriously.\nBut we don\u2019t. At least not yet.\nSo economists want us to use one of the most fundamental tools in their toolkit \u2014 a price signal \u2014 to avoid catastrophe.\nEnter carbon pricing.\nA carbon price, whether in the form of a carbon tax or a cap and trade model, discourages the activities that make climate change worse. If it costs more to roast the planet, fewer people will do it. If it costs more to drive, people will drive less.\nWe really, really need people to drive less.\nDozens of countries already have carbon prices. They\u2019ve had them for years. So we have lots of good data to show what the economic impacts are. That evidence shows us conclusively that carbon taxes do effectively reduce emissions, and that they do not hurt the economy by creating inflation. This was proven so thoroughly that the proof won the Nobel Prize in Economics, the highest honour recognizing excellence in economic research in the entire world.\nAfter years of research, eleven teams at Stanford university comprehensively stated that \u201cWe find robust evidence that even the most ambitious carbon tax is consistent with long-term positive economic growth, near baseline rates, not even counting the growth benefits of a less-disrupted climate or lower ambient air pollution.\u201d\nCanada\u2019s carbon tax is far too small.\nThe design of Canada\u2019s federal carbon tax is excellent, based on a fee-and-dividend model that gives rebates directly to citizens to offset its cost. The money the biggest polluters pay ends up in the pockets of those who are doing the right thing. The problem is that it\u2019s too small to make enough of a difference.\nOn April 1st, Canada\u2019s federal carbon tax rises to $50 per tonne (in Canadian currency, which is closer to $40 USD). The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \u2014 the largest collective scientific effort in all of human history \u2014 tells us that carbon prices need to average somewhere between $140 and $590 USD a ton, and be accompanied by other measures, to avoid the absolute worst.\n$50 isn\u2019t going to cut it. It makes you feel like you\u2019re doing something, even though it isn\u2019t doing remotely enough. Climate tokenism can be more dangerous than outright denial, because it encourages complacency.\nBut $50 is enough to feel, especially within the context of the highest inflation rate in decades. The carbon price is just now finally starting to bite at the gas pump.\nThat\u2019s what it\u2019s supposed to do.\nIt\u2019s what it\u2019s there for. That\u2019s the entire point.\nIt may already be too late. Irreversible tipping points are already starting to topple like dominos. The arctic is 30\u00baC above normal and the antarctic 40\u00baC higher. Climate scientists are filling their underoos about it. This is crunch time. It\u2019s now or never. If we\u2019re really lucky, this decade will provide us one final chance to avoid complete global catastrophe. We will not get another.\nDeath is inevitable for all of us, but we don\u2019t have to be paying top dollar to hasten its arrival. More than 150 years since science started warning us about greenhouse gases, we\u2019re still throwing financial support behind climate arson like nobody\u2019s business. Add together direct subsidies (\u201cHere, have a million dollars\u201d), indirect subsidies (\u201cWe\u2019re not going to ask you for that million dollars you owe us\u201d) and non-monetary gifts (\u201cWe\u2019re spending another million tax dollars on that pipeline you wanted to get built\u201d) and the world is hastening its own demise by a staggering eleven million dollars every single minute of every day.\nBeside that, a couple of cents of carbon tax at the gas pump just can\u2019t do the heavy lifting.\nBut people hate it. Virtually our entire generation has been conditioned since infancy to treat any mention of the word taxation as almost a war crime, and filling up a ninety thousand dollar pickup truck that gets less than ten miles a gallon as a god given right. Right wing politicos magnify anger about it online 24\u20137.\nThey call giving fossil fuel tens of billions in gifts \u201ca war on oil and gas\u201d when really it\u2019s a war on the well being of our entire ecosystem.\nNow the end game: undoing even the tiny good we\u2019ve accomplished.\nClimate is hunger. It\u2019s disaster. It\u2019s thirst. It\u2019s war. It\u2019s economic collapse. It\u2019s violence. How are we responding?\nGovernment after government is now creating special subsidies to make gasoline cheaper and encourage more fossil fuel consumption. Alberta is eliminating gasoline taxes to cater to SUV drivers. Ontario will almost certainly follow suit. Canada\u2019s federal Conservative Party demands a new special tax exemption for gasoline purchases. The government of British Columbia is cutting checks for $110\u2013165 for drivers to help them drive as much as possible. It doesn\u2019t matter how badly climate chaos keeps hammering them, they\u2019re determined to dig the hole they\u2019re in even deeper.\nIts not just in Canada, of course. California is giving every car owner $400 to subsidize their driving. $800 if you own two cars.\nIt\u2019s an orgy of new fossil fuel subsidies.\nEcocide is apparently our economy\u2019s apex value.\nAnd let\u2019s be perfectly clear: this is not a noble effort to help struggling citizens, no matter how loudly pundits declare it so. Grocery costs are sky high with nowhere to go but up, but they aren\u2019t proposing to help struggling families put dinner on the table. Housing costs are at an all time high, but they aren\u2019t trying to help citizens afford a decent place to live. This flurry of new measures are aimed only at burning more gasoline. Voters who don\u2019t own cars might as well not exist. They get nothing.\nExcept a planet transformed into a brutal hothouse hellscape for millennia to come. We all get that whether we want it or not.\nSo I\u2019ve had it with climate deniers deliberately missing the point.\nThe more fossil fuel we burn, the more screwed we are. You. Me. The whole planet. I want gasoline prices to go up. That\u2019s what they\u2019re supposed to do. It\u2019s what the carbon tax is for. It\u2019s supposed to change people\u2019s behaviour.\nIncentivizing more gas burning is the dumbest political decision we could make.\nIt\u2019s little different from global Covid response. Covid kills and disables, damaging brains, hearts, lungs, kidneys, and more, increasing stroke and diabetes risks. Long Covid affects growing millions. What are we doing as cases of the most contagious variant yet climb? Blindfolding the health care system while racing to help it spread more widely.\nAt this point our politics basically boil down to a straight-up death wish. Because they\u2019re not just missing the point. They\u2019re missing the target. They\u2019re moving as fast as possible in the opposite direction.\nAnd once we roast the climate, nothing else we might want for our future is going to matter.\nPrivate Jets And Coffee\nSay farewell to your simple pleasures.medium.com\nClimate wizard predicts the present\nA magical comic about all the climate facts you need to know.sustainablesong.medium.com\nThere\u2019s a lot of powerful diverse writers on Medium.

No, you\u2019re not in trouble. That being said, I do have some constructive criticism regarding these monster mockups you sent over. Once again, I\u2019ve got to reiterate, I believe in every single one of you. You wouldn\u2019t be in this mythical creature design department if you hadn\u2019t earned a spot. You\u2019re the best of the best. However even the best can make mistakes.\nSome of the monsters, like the siren, were fantastic, very streamlined. Angela, you\u2019ve got a real future here.

I understood your reasoning, Bill. The half-woman, half-fish concept worked so well for Angela, so why not mash up other creatures? It\u2019s logical. Everyone loves a good combo deal. Unfortunately I feel you might have tried to jam too much in there.\nA lion\u2019s body with a snake as the tail? Excellent! Two of the most terrifying creatures together at last in deadly harmony.\nBut the goat? The board is having a difficult time rationalizing this choice. Goats are not deadly. Unless you\u2019re grass. We need something that will strike fear into the hearts of men, not the crops.\nOh, and here is another one that gave us pause, and not in a good way.\n\nThis isn\u2019t scary. It looks like a large cat got a hold of a crown of some sort. Or maybe an octopus? Honestly we had no idea what to make of this. Yeah, he\u2019ll catch his prey, but only because they\u2019ll be too busy laughing to run away or fight. Stop laughing, Elise. We weren\u2019t. We take our creatures very seriously here. Please redesign this monstrosity into a proper monster.\nSpeaking of redesigns, this one could use another go at the drawing board.\n\nCongratulations, Apple. You created the perpetual bachelor monster. I can\u2019t imagine why you made him a robe. Will people hunt him for his pelt? Does he always walk like that? Does he live in a tacky cave with strobe lights? This was a pass for us.\nAh, here is the most egregious of the samples we were given.\n\nJust so you know, John, the team in charge of human design contacted me. I think they have a pretty legitimate plagiarism complaint here. You can\u2019t simply alter their work a tad bit, grotesque as it is, and call it a day. Make them suck blood with large fangs! Have them spew spooky riddles through multiple mouths to unwary travelers. Anything! This is just lazy. You really thought we wouldn\u2019t notice?\nOverall I\u2019m disappointed. I gave you all plenty of time to complete your monster! If you can\u2019t handle the workload, maybe you\u2019d be happier on the team that\u2019s creating small Australian land birds? No?

Back in the early 1970s, he asked an interesting question: When people find a new job, how do they hear about it?\nAfter interviewing a few hundred job-seekers, Granovetter realized there were three main ways people found jobs. Some would do it formally, by responding to job advertisements. Others would cold-call companies to see if there were any openings. And a final group would use personal contacts \u2014 asking folks in their social network if they knew of any good jobs.\nWhen Granovetter analyzed the responses, two things jumped out at him. The first was that the absolute best jobs came from asking personal contacts. When people found a job by networking with their contacts, those jobs were more likely to be a) high paying and b) personally fulfilling than the ones found by advertisements or cold-calling.\nGranovetter\u2019s second epiphany was even more interesting, though: The usefulness of \u201cweak ties\u201d.\nOf those people who got jobs through personal connections, most of the time it was someone didn\u2019t know very well. About 28 percent of time it was someone they encountered once a year or less. Another 55.6 of the time it as somebody they saw \u201cmore than once a year but less than twice a week.\u201d\nSo the best jobs \u2014the coolest ones, with the top pay \u2014 came from encounters with people we barely know. Or to put it another way, you\u2019re far less likely to hear about a great job opening from a close friend. You\u2019re much more likely to learn about it from a comparative rando.\n\u201cIt is remarkable,\u201d Granovetter marveled, \u201cthat people receive crucial information from individuals whose very existence they have forgotten.\u201d\nWhy exactly would these distant, \u201cweak ties\u201d be so useful to us?\nIt\u2019s counterintuitive, certainly. When you\u2019re looking for a job, you would imagine that the most useful people would be your \u201cstrong ties\u201d: Your close friends who you see all the time, and your immediate family members. After all, they\u2019re the ones who care about you the most. They\u2019re looking out for you. They really want you to find a great job!\nThe problem is, conducting a good job hunt requires casting as wide as net as possible, and canvasing information from really diverse sources. Your strong ties, it turns out, are not very good for that \u2014 because they\u2019re too similar to you. Your close friends and family are often geographically in the same region as you, and they often travel in similar social circles, too. Whatever news they\u2019ve heard, you\u2019ve heard. They may be wonderful for emotional support, but they\u2019re not likely to be a source of novel information.\nThose weak ties, on the other hand, are folks who travel in entirely different orbits. When you run into them \u2014 once a week, once a year \u2014 they\u2019re like a ship from far-off shores, bringing news of distant lands. And that\u2019s precisely why they\u2019re so useful in a job hunt: They broaden your world.\nvia Pixnio\nYou can see pretty easily how the influence of weak ties maps onto the pandemic, and the problem that Flannery describes above.\nIf you worked in a job where things went remote, and/or in a part of the country that hunkered down during the worst periods of the pandemic, you probably lost contact with many, many weak ties. And even if you\u2019re not actively foraging for information (as with looking for a job), losing those lightweight social connections has a way of shrinking your world.\nLast year Amanda Mull wrote a terrific piece for The Atlantic that pondered precisely this point, channeling Granovetter and other thinkers. As she noted \u2026\nThe psychological effects of losing all but our closest ties can be profound. Peripheral connections tether us to the world at large; without them, people sink into the compounding sameness of closed networks. Regular interaction with people outside our inner circle \u201cjust makes us feel more like part of a community, or part of something bigger,\u201d Gillian Sandstrom, a social psychologist at the University of Essex, told me. People on the peripheries of our lives introduce us to new ideas, new information, new opportunities, and other new people. If variety is the spice of life, these relationships are the conduit for it.\nMaybe one small silver lining of the pandemic is that it sharpened our appreciation for these weak ties.\nHere in New York where I live, the fading of the Omicron wave \u2014 coupled with the blessedly mild weather (mostly) of early February \u2014 produced a flood of people heading out into local cafes and bars. They were all voraciously hungry to reconnect, not just with close pals but with the thousands of semi-strangers and oh-hi-it\u2019s-you neighbors one meets on the street, the murmur and jostle of city life. Those ties may be weak, but their impact is strong.\nClive Thompson publishes on Medium three times a week; follow him here to get each post in your email \u2014 and if you\u2019re not a Medium member, you can join here and some of your fees each month will support Clive\u2019s writing!\nClive\u2019s a contributing writer for the New York Times Magazine, a columnist for Wired and Smithsonian magazines, and a regular contributor to Mother Jones.

To evade the Chinese government\u2019s filters. The authorities don\u2019t want conversations they don\u2019t like \u2014 most notably criticisms of major officials. So they run software to autodetect banned keywords on the major Chinese social networks.\nAs a result, Chinese Internet users have developed an extensive lingo of substitution phrases to outwit the filters. For example, after COVID first exploded in China, the government blocked the word \u201cWuhan\u201d \u2014 so users started using the shortform \u201cwh\u201d. When the Chinese Red Cross\u2019 logistics were under scrutiny, citizens figured those conversations would get shut down too, so they began calling it \u201cred ten\u201d (since the Chinese character for \u201cten\u201d resembles a cross). There are four regional politicians who many Chinese citizens most blame for the outbreak; to talk about them, you\u2019d refer to \u201cF4\u201d, a Taiwanese boy band. And so on.\nThis code-talk goes back years. Chinese netizens coined \u201ccheck the water meter\u201d to refer to a dreaded house-call from the police. \u201cDeath by hide and seek\u201d means someone who was killed while in police custody. \u201cEmpty chair\u201d is a reference to Liu Xiaobo, a writer and dissident prevented from receiving his 2010 Nobel Prize. There\u2019s an up-to-date encyclopedia devoted to tracking these code words run by the Berkeley-based China Digital Times.\n\nAnd this political code-word-use happens not just in China, of course. Autocracies around the world often impose top-down language bans, forcing citizens to improvise. In Russia, the government doesn\u2019t want its citizens saying \u201cno to war\u201d \u2014 so some protestors use signs with eight asterisks, since \u201cno to war\u201d in Russian is eight characters long.\nThe lesson here? When you have repressive power online, language evolves at a frenetic pace \u2014 as everyday people try to sneak around the linguistic eye of Sauron.\nThe rise of \u201calgospeak\u201d on the big social networks\nThe weird thing is, we\u2019re now seeing precisely the same dynamics in the major tech giants of the west.\nFrom the Taylor Lorenz Washington Post story on \u201cAlgospeak\u201d\nIn a terrific piece the Washington Post, Taylor Lorenz outlines the rise of \u201calgospeak\u201d \u2014 or, code words that users of Tik Tok, Instagram, YouTube and Facebook use to get around the filters on those services.\nAfter all, big tech firms all do \u201ccontent moderation\u201d. They have subjects they don\u2019t want users discussing, for various reasons. Sometimes those reasons can be understandable \u2014 or ones you might agree with, like trying to reduce the spread of COVID-conspiracy-theory disinformation, or white-supremacist recruitment. Other times they target words and phrases they consider un-NSFW, or related to hate speech. Sometimes they target words for reasons so obscure nobody can figure it out.\nRunning afoul of a word-filter might not get a piece of content outright deleted. But it\u2019ll almost certainly get it downranked in the algorithmic feed \u2014 which is the kiss of death for anyone trying to build or keep an audience.\nEither way, the end result is dynamics that wouldn\u2019t be out of place in the Chinese or Russian polities. Because the big tech firms each have a more-or-less monopoly position in their particular niche, creators have nowhere else to go. They\u2019re stuck. And they can\u2019t risk being invisibled by the algorithm. So whenever they realize a word or phrase is being blocked, they devise a substitute.\nAs Lorenz writes \u2026\nFor instance, in many online videos, it\u2019s common to say \u201cunalive\u201d rather than \u201cdead,\u201d \u201cSA\u201d instead of \u201csexual assault,\u201d or \u201cspicy eggplant\u201d instead of \u201cvibrator.\u201d [snip]\nWhen the pandemic broke out, people on TikTok and other apps began referring to it as the \u201cBackstreet Boys reunion tour\u201d or calling it the \u201cpanini\u201d or \u201cpanda express\u201d as platforms down-ranked videos mentioning the pandemic by name in an effort to combat misinformation. When young people began to discuss struggling with mental health, they talked about \u201cbecoming unalive\u201d in order to have frank conversations about suicide without algorithmic punishment. Sex workers, who have long been censored by moderation systems, refer to themselves on TikTok as \u201caccountants\u201d and use the corn emoji as a substitute for the word \u201cporn.\u201d\nOf course, the platforms generally don\u2019t explain the precise words they\u2019re blocking. They also rarely describe their reasoning, which can change with the wind. This transforms creators, as Cory Doctorow neatly put it, into \u201cKremlinologists who obsessively analyze the behavior of social media algorithms in the hopes of learning how to please them and (more importantly) how to avoid their punishments.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s particularly notable, as Lorenz points out, is how frequently the banned words wind up curtailing subaltern groups. Because Tik Tok users worry about using \u201clesbian\u201d, some have begun saying \u201cle dollar bean\u201d, as a textual write-out of \u201cle$bian\u201d. Women\u2019s health advocates replace words like \u201csex\u201d or \u201cperiod\u201d or \u201cvagina\u201d with substitutes or symbols; some now use \u201cnip nops\u201d in place of \u201cnipples.\u201d Some creators who want to talk about racism have gotten un-algorithmicized for saying \u201cwhite\u201d \u2026 so \u201cthey just hold their palm toward the camera to signify White people,\u201d as Lorenz writes.\nIt\u2019s pretty wild stuff! The behavior is not entirely new in North America, of course. Back in the 90s, family-focused dial-up networks like AOL or Prodigy banned a ton of swear words, so I remember teenagers writing \u201cphuc\u201d in place of the f-bomg (among many other substitutions).\nBut in today\u2019s social feeds \u2014 where pleasing the mysterious algorithm is our modern version of vainly offering sacrifices to an inscrutable Zeus \u2014 the word-game has been amped up into hypermetabolic overdrive. Conspiracy theorists are forced into phrase-evolution, too, as Lorenz notes: \u201cLast year, anti-vaccine groups on Facebook began changing their names to \u201cdance party\u201d or \u201cdinner party\u201d and anti-vaccine influencers on Instagram used similar code words, referring to vaccinated people as \u2018swimmers.\u2019\u201d And for years, Instagram has been trying to ban pro-anorexia creators by banning their phrases of choice, only to find those creators just generate new phrases the next week.\nIt\u2019s a cat and mouse game, without end.\nThe way out? Actual human moderation, at smaller scale\n\u201cheather gold and deborah schultz on tummeling in a digital world\u201d, via jonny goldstein\nThe thing is, it doesn\u2019t have to be this way.\nIt\u2019s quite possible to have social networks that a) maintain standards of behavior on their services without b) resorting to crude ban-lists. You can do it in a more nuanced way!\nThe thing is, those nuanced ways generally involve a ton of human labor.\nTo have a healthier style of moderation, a social network would need to have employees whose entire job is acting as online hosts. You could apply human judgement to user behavior, in other words, instead of relying mostly on automated judgement.\nNow human judgement is fallible, of course. But humans are more accountable. You can ask them why they made a decision and they can explain it; you can disagree, but at least you know why it happened. This is precisely the opposite of what goes on with automated algorithmic bans, which, as big tech engineers have explained to me, are now so complex that the engineers themselves can\u2019t always explain why a piece of content is being downranked.\nIf you went this \u201chuman-first\u201d route, those humans would need to be well-paid actual employees of the social network, employees who are listened to inside their company and respected by their organization. You can\u2019t just outsource that work to third-party content-moderation farms with ghastly work conditions.\nAnd if you went the human-first route, a social network would no longer need to rely on banning as the first (and only) mechanism for setting standards. When you have human employees who engage with users, their job would often be less about banning the bad stuff than encouraging the good and cool and creative stuff. The ban-hammer is a tool of second resort.\nOver ten years ago, Heather Gold, Deb Schultz and Kevin Marks explored how this human labor works, on their fantastic, long-running show Tummelvision \u2014 for \u201ctummler,\u201d an old Yiddish word for the person who keeps a party going. As they discovered, most high-functioning online communities all had tummlers. That nuanced social human work kept the forums from going septic, and from needing endless bans. Flickr had tummlers in its early days. Metafilter still does.\nSo yeah, it actually is possible to have social networks that don\u2019t need inscrutable ban-word lists.\nThe problem? Scale, and monopolies\nvia pixabay\nThe problem? This human-driven style of moderation requires a lot of work. It cannot be automated by an AI. (Or by a crude list of banned words that the social network hand-wavingly assures us is Super Sophisticated AI, which is probably often the case, frankly.) To do this human-style, you need to pay and respect the humans doing that labor. It works best \u2014 indeed, might be only possible \u2014 in social networks with reasonably limited sizes. You can\u2019t do it with a billion people hammering away at your network.\nAnd of course, our big social networks have no interest in working that way. They all want to be utterly massive. They want to have world-dominating scale. And they want to use as little human labor as possible.\nSo we wind up with banned-word regimes that are unsettingly similar to those in repressive countries around the world.\nThis is, really, another argument for antitrust scrutiny of the major social networks. If one of key problems behind their inability to moderate their content with human-scale judgement is that they\u2019re just too damn big, maybe the bigness is the problem. If there were far more social networks, and smaller ones \u2014 companies that genuinely competed with one another \u2014 you\u2019d see a much more active competitive landscape. I bet (can\u2019t guarantee, but bet) it would evolve far more nuanced moderation, not least because it\u2019s something that users clearly want.\nUntil then, we\u2019ll be speaking the algospeak.\nJoin Medium with my referral link - Clive Thompson\nAs a Medium member, a portion of your membership fee goes to writers you read, and you get full access to every story\u2026clivethompson.medium.com\nClive Thompson publishes on Medium three times a week; follow him here to get each post in your email \u2014 and if you\u2019re not a Medium member, you can join here.\nClive is a contributing writer for the New York Times Magazine, a columnist for Wired and Smithsonian magazines, and a regular contributor to Mother Jones.

The Sidekick pointed another way.\n\nLast weekend, I cleaned out one of my Messed Up Old Tech drawers, with help from my 14 year old son. We tossed out some ancient Mesopotamian Zip drives, a copy of Microsoft Office 2000, and a tangle of cords whose original functions are lost to the mists of time.\nAt the bottom of the drawer we found a real prize, though:\nMy 2004 Sidekick II phone.\n\nIf you were in your teens or twenties back around the turn of the century, you probably remember this device. The first version arrived in 2002; the second (the one you see above) in 2004.\nBack in the early \u201800s, mobile phones were still awfully basic \u2014 they made phone calls and sent texts. To compose a text, you pecked away on the twelve-button keypad. That was it, mostly.\nSo the Sidekick arrived like a pure blast from the future. It had a complete web browser, built-in messaging apps (like AOL Instant Messenger), email and texting, and an honest-to-goodness app store. The device pioneered so many things it\u2019s hard to list them all! It was the first phone to let you multitask several apps at once, for example, and the first to keep you abreast of what each app was doing. (If you got an IM on AOL while using another app, it\u2019d display the message scrolling along the top. Common today! But invented by the Sidekick folks.) The phone stored data in the cloud. Developers released a wild array of software for the Sidekick, including a full-on telnet/SSH client that I used to log into old-school text-based BBSes, like I\u2019d stepped straight out of a goddamn hacker movie.\nBut the absolute killer feature was that rotating screen. It flicked open with the menace of a switchblade, making a sumptuous snick. Beneath it lay a keyboard so ergonomically wonderful that I could type practically as fast as I could on my laptop.\nIt was the sweetest phone anyone had ever seen. I was an early adopter of the first model, and when I opened it on the subway in 2002, heads turned.\nAnd frankly, they probably still would!\nWhen I showed my son how the screen snapped open, his eyes widened. He flicked it open and shut. Snick snick. Snick snick snick snick snick.\n\u201cThis,\u201d he proclaimed, \u201cis incredibly cool.\u201d\nJust for the hell of it, he brought it to his high school to see what his peers thought. They agreed: It was inescapably badass. (\u201cWait, I really need one of these right now,\u201d as one of his friends gasped.) The phone doesn\u2019t even work any more, because I lost the charger. But merely holding the Sidekick in their hands, they could perceive that the phone was a triumph of design, the likes of which they had never before beheld.\nI cannot resist making lists, and in fact no longer try; so this got me thinking about Three Reasons the Sidekick Was The Most Stylish Phone Ever.\nLet\u2019s begin \u2026\n1) Its design was utterly unique\nYeah, I can\u2019t tell which one is mine either. (via Wikimedia)\nToday\u2019s phones are amazingly functional. They\u2019re full-fledged computers; it\u2019s almost weird we still call them phones, really. I\u2019ve written entire articles on mine. They\u2019re indispensable.\nBut as a piece of design? They\u2019re incredibly boring. Ever since the iPhone turned the screen into a single brick of glass, phones have all evolved in that direction. These days they\u2019re utterly identical. If you put six different models of smartphone on a table and stood ten feet away, you\u2019d be hard pressed to know which was which.\nAgain, on one level, this is fine, maybe even laudable; it indicates that there\u2019s something extremely useful about today\u2019s form factor. Interfaces that are purely software-based can be much more flexible than ones built from physical buttons and dials.\nBut damn, when you look at the Sidekick? Its sheer, joyous physicality is what sets it apart. The rotating screen is a pure industrial-design flex.\nPut it on a table, and everyone would know instantly what they\u2019re looking at.\n2) It had truly joyful ergonomics\nQuite apart from that cunningly swiv\u2019ling screen, the Sidekick was a bouquet of lovely ergonomics.\nThe first two models had a little scroll-wheel on the right-hand side, for quickly flipping up and down web pages, menus, emails, or messages. It was perfectly chunky and nubbly; I developed a nuanced muscle-memory for precisely how far to spin it.\nThe keyboard was exquisitely useable. Each button had a satisfying click, and they were spaced enough for wide-fingered folk. The F and J keys had nubbins on them to orient your fingers; I could touch-type 30 words a minute without looking down. There were four thick buttons, one on each corner of the Sidekick, and \u201cbumper\u201d buttons along the edges. It even sported a D-pad, perfect for gaming.\nThe device was practically a fidget spinner. It reminded you that you had a body, and that a body can be a nice thing to possess.\nAgain, I\u2019m not saying I\u2019d want to go back to such a deeply physically-defined device. Virtual UIs are certainly more flexible!\nBut damn, the Sidekick was fun to hold, and fun to use.\n3) It broadcast ambient information\nThe first two versions of the Sidekick had multicolored LEDs embedded in the scroll wheel (and later the D-pad). You could set them to glow in patterns that specified some type of message had come in. As one of the creators Chris Desalvo described it \u2026\nWhen the screen was turned off the LED would periodically blink to let you know you had notifications waiting. You could choose what color and flashing pattern you wanted for each app. For instance, on my hiptop I knew that yellow meant I had unread IMs, blue meant email, purple was for calendar, red was for web page loading, etc. I could glance at my hiptop from across the room and know what was going on.\nThat glanceability was amazing, and I used it all the time. I could see from a few feet away that I\u2019d received an Instant Message, or that some new email had arrived.\nIt meant you could put the device a little out of sight \u2014 so you weren\u2019t tempted to stare at it \u2014 yet know generally what was going on. It made the Sidekick into something that was a bit like the \u201ccalm technology\u201d that John Seely Brown described in a famous 1996 essay.\nI wish more modern phones allowed for some sort of similarly ambient signaling. They don\u2019t really have much. Sure, they\u2019ve got audio alerts, but (on the iPhone, anyway) they\u2019re far less granular than I\u2019d like. Same goes for the haptic alerts. And they don\u2019t glow in any meaningful way. Their visible alerts are generally text-based, which is to say: distracting.\nThose are just the most obvious points. There are probably a lot more of design lessons one could tease out of the Sidekick.\nAlas, the industry has gone a different way, and that design is now permanently in the dustbin of history.\nBut teenagers today can still dream.\n\nJoin Medium with my referral link - Clive Thompson\nAs a Medium member, a portion of your membership fee goes to writers you read, and you get full access to every story\u2026clivethompson.medium.com\nClive Thompson publishes on Medium three times a week; follow him here to get each post in your email \u2014 and if you\u2019re not a Medium member, you can join here.\nClive is a contributing writer for the New York Times Magazine, a columnist for Wired and Smithsonian magazines, and a regular contributor to Mother Jones.

That\u2019s a painting by Wolfgang, done in the style of Fernand L\u00e9ger.\nThe Beltracchis sold millions of dollars worth of fakes, and were only tripped up in the mid-2000s when Wolfgang made a critical mistake \u2014 he made a fake that he claimed was from 1914, but in which he used a type of paint that didn\u2019t exist back then.\nAs the Guardian reports, he used \u2026\n\u2026 titanium white, a pigment that was not used by the supposed painter in 1914. Beltracchi had run out of zinc, which he used to mix with his white colour himself, and he bought a pure zinc white from a Dutch manufacturer that did not disclose that the paint contained traces of titanium white.\nThat was his \u201cfatal error\u201d. It sparked a police investigation. Panic spread through the art world and, in 2011, a German court sentenced Wolfgang and Helene to six and four years respectively.\nIt\u2019s a fascinating story, and there\u2019s a book about it \u2014 Psychoanalyst Meets Helene and Wolfgang Beltracchi \u2014 that I really want to read now.\n2) \ud83e\ude81 Generating electricity by flying kites\n\nWind power is now incredibly cheap, but it\u2019s resource-intensive to build: You need a ton of metal and a lot of land (or sea) devoted exclusively for the turbines.\nSo one intriguing idea being explored is to generate wind power with kites. The idea is that you can get \u2019em up as high as wind turbines go \u2014 where the wind is pretty strong \u2014 then fly them in figure-eight patterns. You generate power by having the kites pull on tethers on the ground, or by having rotors on the kites do regenerative braking as the kites wheel around the sky.\nAs a writeup in Ars Technica describes it \u2026\nThe kites aren\u2019t simply floating passively in the air. Instead, they use the aerodynamics of the kite to fly \u201ccrosswind\u201d patterns, a bit like a boat tacking back and forth across the wind. Flying perpendicular to the direction of the wind, their wings generate lift and pull even harder against the tether. This extra lift translates into extra speed, which can either pull the tether with more force for ground-based generation or be turned into greater airspeed to drive onboard turbines faster. Either way, the power available increases by at least an order of magnitude compared to flying without the crosswind motion.\nThe downside? It\u2019s complex as hell, and a kind of weird sell, given that wind power is by now a pretty mature industry.\nThe upside: Kites require an order of magnitude less raw materials, and they don\u2019t permanently occupy land \u2014 so you needs less capital and can deploy kites on an ad hoc basis wherever you\u2019ve got an empty field.\nInteresting stuff. If you want to read more here\u2019s a full recent report breaking down how the tech works and its possible viability.\n3) \ud83c\udf44 Decoding a possible language of fungi\nvia Wikipedia\nDo fungi communicate with each other, in something structured like a language?\nFor a while now, scientists have known that fungi are connected via underground filaments known as \u201chyphae\u201d, and that they send electrical impulses from one to another, almost the way nerve cells send impulses around the human body. Andrew Adamatzky at the University of the West of England wondered if these inter-fungi signals are a form of communication.\nSo he wired up a bunch of fungi to record the impulses, and see if they seemed to have any suggestive patterns.\nThey did! As he notes in a paper \u2014 \u201cLanguage of fungi derived from their electrical spiking activity\u201d \u2014 the impulses aren\u2019t random. He also noticed that they appeared to correspond to stimuli; if you touched one fungi with a piece of wood, for example, it produced patterns of impulses heading out to other fungi, as if the first one were trying to communicate to the others about the event.\nAdamatzky hypothesizes that it\u2019s a form of language \u2026\nThe research, published in Royal Society Open Science, found that these spikes often clustered into trains of activity, resembling vocabularies of up to 50 words, and that the distribution of these \u201cfungal word lengths\u201d closely matched those of human languages.\nSplit gills \u2014 which grow on decaying wood, and whose fruiting bodies resemble undulating waves of tightly packed coral \u2014 generated the most complex \u201csentences\u201d of all.\nThe most likely reasons for these waves of electrical activity are to maintain the fungi\u2019s integrity \u2014 analogous to wolves howling to maintain the integrity of the pack \u2014 or to report newly discovered sources of attractants and repellants to other parts of their mycelia, Adamtzky suggested.\nGranted, this is just a very provisional hypothesis. It\u2019s also possible, Adamatsky notes, that the fungi \u201care saying nothing\u201d, and that the impulses are just differences in potential.\nI can\u2019t figure out if this guy is headed for an Ig Nobel, a Nobel, or possibly both. This work adds to a healthy pre-existing debate on whether or not trees communicate with each other. Like fungi, trees certainly have networks, and they do send carbon from one tree to another \u2026 but as this excellent piece in Smithsonian notes, nobody really agrees if it constitutes communication.\n4) \ud83d\udcf7 \u201cSousveillance capitalism\u201d\n\u201cSurveillance camera\u201d, by Bart Everson\nBack in the 00s, the technologist Steve Mann foresaw an age of omnipresent cameras in the hands of everyday folks. He figured this would create a new style of surveillance: Instead of people in power pointing cameras at us from above \u2014 as with banks and governments recording our activities on security cams \u2014 it would be the average person pointing the camera upwards. So he called it \u201csousveillance\u201d, from the French sous, for \u201cbelow\u201d.\nThen a few years ago, Shoshana Zuboff coined the terrific phrase \u201csurveillance capitalism\u201d \u2014 capturing the grim dynamics of a world where huge corporations make their money off harvesting data on our every moment. There was something undemocratizing and alarming, Zuboff argued, about living in a world where so much power was concentrated in so few massive institutional hands.\nNow in Wired, Katherine Cross points out an interesting new trend that lies at the intersection of those two forces: \u201cSousveillance capitalism.\u201d\n\u201cSousveillance capitalism\u201d is the form of oppressive attention that comes from having to perform for \u2014 and cater to the whims of \u2014 a massive online crowd of people. Unlike surveillance capitalism, these cameras pointed at you aren\u2019t in the hands of a small number of massively powerful institutions. No, they\u2019re in the hands of what one could call one\u2019s peers, or \u2014 if you\u2019re actively making your money in the attention economy \u2014 one\u2019s audience, or one\u2019s fans.\nEither way, as Cross notes, the dictates of \u201csousveillance capitalism\u201d have a grimness all to their own, as one can see in the miserable lives of online influencers \u2026\nTwitch streamers, for example, find themselves working incredibly long hours to harvest and churn subscribers, then satisfy the ones they have by being a \u201ccharacter\u201d that other people can enjoy; LARPing for an unsteady income, while letting it leak into every part of your life, whether you\u2019re online or not. Every streamer you like, every influencer, every Twitter personality or viral TikTok star, is operating in an economy of incentives that demand actual emotional labor from them \u2014 sometimes 24/7. Lindsay Ellis\u2019 video on how YouTube streamers \u201cmanufacture authenticity\u201d remains essential viewing; it\u2019s a grimly apposite irony that Ellis herself was run off of the platform late last year because she couldn\u2019t cope with the ongoing harassment from people who criticized the way she handled a controversy that spiraled well beyond any sense of proportion. This is all part of the grim harvest of capitalism\u2019s newfound lust for the intangible.\nIt\u2019s a really crackling essay \u2014 you should seriously go check it out. In addition to locating this fascinating Venn overlap between sousveillance and surveillance capitalism, Cross also neatly ropes in several other big ideas of the last few decades, like emotional labor (the form of work that so drains all those hapless online streamers) and crowdsourcing, which is how sousveillance can grow into such an oppressive force. One or two people staring at you online and offering their thoughts on your performance of yourself might not be so bad, but tens or hundreds of them \u2014 one\u2019s crowdsourced bosses, as Cross neatly distills it \u2014 are a goddamn nightmare.\n5) \ud83d\udda5 \ufe0fPockit, a modular computer\n\nCheck out this fascinating video for Pockit, a \u201cmodular\u201d computer being designed by Anil Reddy. Basically, it\u2019s a main board that has magnetic connectors to other elements \u2014 so you can snap on a screen, a button, a slider, some smaller OLED screens, thermal cameras and regular cameras, or a full keyboard. Each time you snap on a new component, Reddy\u2019s software autodetects what component it is and makes it instantly available for use.\nThe idea is to create a Lego-like device for quickly crafting little gizmos on the fly, as he told Gizmodo last year \u2026\nReddy spent his early days as an embedded engineer, designing all sorts of projects from scratch using those exact, and sometimes painstaking, processes. A lot of people have great ideas for gadgets, even if they only want to make one for themselves, but soldering and coding alone take a while to learn. Reddy wanted to give electronic DIYers an easier way to create gadgets where their only limit would be their creativity.\n\u201cUnlike building a desk or even a website, it\u2019s unimaginable for most people to make an electronic device. Buying chips, reading documentation, wiring, soldering, coding, debugging, and you\u2019re already a few weeks in,\u201d Reddy said.\nIt reminds me of the genius behind Ayah Bdeir\u2019s Littlebits, electronics components that snapped together via magnetic connections. I watched kids muck around with Littlebits and have an absolute blast; I can imagine it\u2019ll be pretty fun to snap together computational blocks, too.\n6) \ud83d\udc7b Online Ouija board\n\nBehold \u201cOuija Online\u201d, an interactive board where you type a question, then click on the planchette until an answer materializes in spooky script at the top of the screen.\nI asked it, \u201cwhen will I die?\u201d\nSoon\n\u201cHow soon?\u201d\nSecret\n\u201cAre you human?\u201d\nI used to be\nTechnically, of course, I know this is just a slurry of Javascript masking some scripted chatbot, the narrow contours of which I would undoubtedly quickly bump up against if I spent more than four minutes with it. But I\u2019ll never find out, because I got too creeped out and closed the window.\n7) A final, sudden-death round of reading material\n\u201cAuntie\u201d and \u201cfictive kinship\u201d in Black America. \ud83d\udd2e Jack White plays the Star Spangled Banner. \ud83d\udd2e \u201cxit\u201d, a plain-text format for to-do lists and checklists. \ud83d\udd2e Little-known, but deeply cool, HTML attributes. \ud83d\udd2e Clay art that looks digital. \ud83d\udd2e Creating liquid lenses for next-gen space telescopes. \ud83d\udd2e What it\u2019s like to adopt a pigeon. \ud83d\udd2e The candy-floss sellers of Mumbai. \ud83d\udd2e A NASA satellite spots dry ice on Mars. \ud83d\udd2e The professor of gaslighting. \ud83d\udd2e A cop pulls over a self-driving car. \ud83d\udd2e When rand() calls malloc(), and havoc ensues. \ud83d\udd2e The mounting pile of lawsuits over stolen ape NFTs. \ud83d\udd2e Le Monde launches an English edition partially translated by AI. \ud83d\udd2e Catapulting satellites into orbit from the ground. \ud83d\udd2e \u201cBias bounties.\u201d\nJoin Medium with my referral link - Clive Thompson\nAs a Medium member, a portion of your membership fee goes to writers you read, and you get full access to every story\u2026clivethompson.medium.com\nClive Thompson publishes on Medium three times a week; follow him here to get each post in your email \u2014 and if you\u2019re not a Medium member, you can join here.\nClive is a contributing writer for the New York Times Magazine, a columnist for Wired and Smithsonian magazines, and a regular contributor to Mother Jones.

It feels like the world is 2 hours away from you. I was living in Manchester which wasn\u2019t in the heart of Europe, but a return ticket to another European city cost less than $100.\nI had a chunk of savings in my Indian Rupees which quickly squeezed when it converted to Euros. What did I do next?\nI sat and planned a solo trip for 19 days across 6 countries. I printed out the map of Europe, drew my plan with a pencil and kept a tracker of dates, accommodation, travel, and costs.\nThe costs equalled each penny of the savings I owned.\nThey say never put all your eggs in one basket, but here I was determined to do something which excited and scared me at the same time.\nHow often do you hear of an Indian woman travelling alone? We hardly go alone to a different city! Our society doesn\u2019t tell us to \u2018live your life and conquer the world\u2019 but to be aware and take care of yourself.\nThe 21-year-old me went ahead with this plan anyway, knowing there will be no more extra money to shop or do something fun.\nFast forward to today, I\u2019d be lying if I didn\u2019t mention that I came back as a different person. 2 years later these experiences have built the person that I am today and I\u2019ll tell you why.\nEvery prejudice you have read and heard is wrong.\nPeople told me the Brits are rude and the Germans aren\u2019t friendly. They told me Paris is overhyped and the French are unkind to those who do not speak their language.\nMy bubble broke when I experienced exactly the opposite.\nThe Brits are rude? I haven\u2019t ever heard so many \u2018thank yous\u2019 and \u2018apologies\u2019 in my life which I did in a year of staying in England.\nA German couple walked me to my destination instead of being \u2018rude\u2019 or simply explaining to me where to go.\nMeet people with a blank slate in your head. It will change your life.\nLet your experiences be the colour to this blank slate instead of your preconceived notions.\nYou are not what you\u2019ve always been told.\nPhoto by Daniel on Unsplash\nI don\u2019t know how many of you were bullied or struggled with confidence. Even if this doesn't apply to you, we all have certain beliefs of who we are.\nThese beliefs are a result of our environment and our thoughts. They are not real.\nYou think you\u2019re too fat, too skinny, too soft-spoken, not good enough \u2014 all because of what you tell yourself.\nBut when you\u2019re out in the world all alone, you meet people who appreciate things about you you\u2019ve never even noticed. We humans are famous for criticising ourselves.\nI never knew that dark brown is a beautiful eye colour because its the only eye colour in my country, and then on a train in Berlin somebody told me that it\u2019s a beautiful colour.\nI was shocked, and then he told me blue and green are seen everywhere but brown is rare for him. I have been brought up thinking that coloured eyes are beautiful (because they are rare).\nAppreciate the tiniest bits of yourself and uncover yourself with awareness.\nExperiences where you are pushed out of your comfort zone often help you discover yourself.\nYour beliefs are challenged.\nWhen we\u2019re in one environment, we grow with and around it. We have a preference for certain things, people, food, habits.\nI have always thought that getting a degree and working hard is how you create life. But when I travelled, I was full of thoughts and wanted to create a different life for myself.\nYou ideate, think and dream.\nYou suddenly think you are more than what you\u2019ve been told and there\u2019s so much you can do.\nYou brain is exploring these thoughts coming from origins it hasn\u2019t tapped into before. Instead of looking at problems which we usually think of, it turns into a solution designing mode.\n\u201cWhat we can or cannot do, what we consider possible or impossible, is rarely a function of our true capability. It is more likely a function of our beliefs about who we are.\u201d\n\u2014 Tony Robbins\nLetting yourself free in an unknown place can tell you a lot about yourself which has been unknown to you.\nHumanity is very much prevalent.\nHonestly, fuck the news which is bought by institutions to fulfill their personal agendas.\nThe world is not full of cruelty and everybody you meet does not want to harm you.\nI was often asked, \u201cWhat if you get kidnapped? Haven\u2019t you watched Taken?\u201d\nI can also be kidnapped, raped, or trafficked in my own country. Why do the chances increase only when I am away?\nPeople are kind and helpful. They want to be nice to people visiting their country and fellow travelers want to explore and create memories with you.\nHumanity is still prevalent, it\u2019s just hardly covered in news.\nThe learning curve is unfathomable.\nPhoto by Priscilla Du Preez on Unsplash\nWhat you learn from academics is one thing and what you learn from books is another. What you learn from listening to stories and experiences is makes you get goosebumps and lives with you forever.\nI heard about the struggle of a Syrian refugee and also about Kiwi woman who was driving around Europe since 2 months all alone. I heard hundreds of stories and realised how our life and realities are strikingly different.\nYou need not even listen, just wait\u2026the world will offer itself freely to you, unmasking itself.\n\u2014 Franz Kafka\nI mentioned I heard hundreds of stories but previously, I also attached myself to the words \u2018introvert\u2019 and \u2018underconfident\u2019. Somebody who is unable to speak to new or unknown people.\nI guess travel teaches you and moulds you along its course.\nPhoto by Element5 Digital on Unsplash\nSpending all my money on travel did not make me broke but made me richer. It gave me the courage to take big steps and the courage to detach myself from existing beliefs and believe in myself.\nIt made me richer with experiences and bonds. It made me richer with ideas and creativity. In my opinion, this is the only thing which is glamourised by social media and is actually worth it.\nI hope you lose and find yourself at the same time.", "comment_count": 17, "like_count": 1521, "created_time": 1600509331216, "comment": [{"user_id": "7d8341a13e2c", "comment_time": 1600509331216, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "b2092d476f15", "comment_time": 1601519111145, "comment": "I learned a lot due to my travels.

I didn\u2019t know what to answer, because it\u2019s a country where everybody\u2019s reality is drastically different from others.\nMine differs from those opposite my house who live in straw huts, and those 5 minutes away who live in $3,000,000 high-rise luxury apartments.\nSo let me give you an insight into what it\u2019s like, and why it's beautiful. And also a brutally honest account of what sucks.\nFor reference, I have travelled to 24 countries to draw comparisons: extensively in Europe, a few times to the US, the Middle East, a bit of Asia and once to Australia.\nThere\u2019s a Lot of \u2018Basic\u2019 We Lack\nWhen I was studying in Manchester in the U.K., I remember face-timing my dad and telling him it's been raining for a day and the electricity hadn\u2019t gone yet.\nIt\u2019s because every time it rains back at home, we have a power cut.\nAnd I live in a metropolitan city where things are better than in the rest of the country!\nAlso, no air conditioning or central heating even where it snows\u2026\nThis is probably \u2018basic\u2019 for the developed nations, but we lack stuff like power, water, walkways, traffic rules, safety, and the list is endless.\nBut Here\u2019s What Pulls Us\nThe thing about African and Asian communities is that we\u2019re collective in nature.\nAccording to Social Psychology, there are two dynamics in communities:\nCollectivism: where the community comes first.\nIndividualism: where self-interest precedes everything else.\nIn individual communities, they decide on the premises of \u201cI need this\u201d whereas, for us, it's always we. We don\u2019t decide solely by thinking about ourselves.\nAccording to Very Well Mind, the traits of a collectivistic culture are:\nSocial rules focus on promoting selflessness\nWorking as a group\nDoing what's best for the society\nFamilies and communities have a central role\nBy now, in my 25 years of breathing, I don\u2019t know what it's like to not think of others before every decision I make.\nIt has its pros and cons, though.\nThe biggest benefit is the warmth and sense of belongingness.\nThe sad part is the burden of expectations.\nI believe more people should be able to make decisions they enjoy, instead of what their families expect from them.\nHumans Thrive on This\nWe love to belong to something or somebody.\nJust like my American aunt, who joins church and bible study groups in the US. Our communities are not found in any groups but in people around us.\nWe find this belongingness over a cup of chai (tea) in the evening. For some religious folks, it could also be from following similar traditions of prayers or a guru.\nFor me, it\u2019s just the people I\u2019m surrounded by. One is never alone.\nBut according to my grandma, we\u2019ve become a selfish society.\nYou see, at her time, there was no concept of \u2018personal space\u2019 or individuality. Your entire day was around your family and responsibilities because women didn\u2019t work at that time.\nSo seeing that we want to be in our own rooms to watch TV, need space to be alone, or not spend all our free time together is rather selfish and makes her feel alone.\n\u2018Developing\u2019 = Opportunities\nIn India, we have UPI \u2014 Unified Payments interface. We can make all payments online or in-person from our phones in under 3 seconds, by scanning a barcode.\nIt\u2019s software connected to your bank that immediately transfers the money to another person\u2019s bank. Even the roadside fruit seller has it.\nI haven\u2019t seen this anywhere in the world and it certainly makes life easy.\nWe also have a thriving startup ecosystem, the third-largest in the world.\nI\u2019ve worked in one as a recruiter where I saw that even Indians who study in good universities abroad or in Ivy League choose to come back to build something.\nBecause there are problems. And in problems lie opportunities to fix them.\nThe Food!!!\nWhen I was living in the U.K., the strawberries, blueberries, grapes, and kiwi, were all packaged in plastic and came from different countries. They were so delicious!\nHere, we get all our fruits from the roadside fruit seller. Of course, there are shops, big supermarkets, and all of that \u2014 but this feels the freshest.\nAnd have you tried Indian cuisine yet? It\u2019s out of the world.\n(I recommend butter chicken, dal makhani, shahi paneer, and naan for newbies)\nBut I May Not Want to Live Here Forever\nI\u2019m done with my childhood and education, and it was good at the time it happened. But if and when I have kids, I probably wouldn\u2019t want to live here at all.\nPhysical movement\nMy cousins in the States go kayaking, hiking, and strawberry-picking, and have the facilities (and good weather) for outdoor activities.\nIn Europe, everybody does a lot of walking.\nBut here, we just stay indoors. It\u2019s not just a lack of facilities but also that it\u2019s hot eight months of the year in my city.\nThe competition\nYou need to score 99% to be in top government colleges. I don\u2019t find the academic-driven competition worth it one bit. It\u2019s mentally draining to keep studying so much.\nToxic air\nDelhi has the worst pollution.\nThe AQI (air quality index) is 312 as I type this and between 400\u2013500 in winters.\nFor reference, \u2018satisfactory\u2019 AQI should be under 100.\nWhen I lived in Manchester, the AQI used to be under 50!\nThe quality of the air we breathe is hazardous and I\u2019m sure this will have health effects a few decades later when I\u2019m old. It's sad to live in such a beautiful city that offers you so much luxury but not the right to breathe.\nCost of living\nI know people think India is really poor, and parts of it are. But education in cities is more expensive than ever.\nEven the boarding school I graduated from 8 years ago has hiked its fee by 400%, and good schools are awfully expensive.\nThe cost of living is shooting up for people who aren\u2019t paid well enough to afford that.\nWhen I say, \u201cI may not live here forever,\u201d it\u2019s an idealistic thought process of a 25-year-old.\nFor now, I\u2019m happy with things as they are. Sure, it\u2019s easy for me to draw a quick comparison when I\u2019m annoyed at simple things since I\u2019ve seen both sides of a coin.\nBut somewhere between nobody following traffic rules, the noise of horns, and the diversity of languages, clothes, and food changing every 100 km, I\u2019ve found my solace.\nClick here to subscribe to my weekly newsletter that leaves you healthier and happier.

Some crib about how they\u2019re struggling to make ends meet.\nBurnouts, overworking, and overdoing with launching too many things are common too.\nAfter being in the ecosystem for nine months and studying it for a year before that, here\u2019s how it's like to be a full-time creator.\nRemember \u2014 all that shines isn\u2019t gold.\nNone of Us Got Results Too Fast\nA lot of us saw a drastic change in a year, just one year that changed our lives completely.\nBut nobody talks about the work that\u2019s gone in before that, even if it\u2019s completely unrelated to what you\u2019re doing right now.\nFor me, people comment that I suddenly rose on with \u2018random virality\u2019 LinkedIn and have a growing account on Medium and Twitter.\nBut I\u2019ve been writing since I was 8! I\u2019ve been writing online since 18 for fun. Ultimately, the results that took place in \u2018just a year\u2019 have years of work behind it.\nSmall efforts that sharpened my skill.\nThis is true with most writers and creators. They\u2019ve all done the work for far too long for fun and by not getting paid.\nIt\u2019s Hard Unless You\u2019re in Love\nImagine this.\nYou set your own targets and schedule. Your goal is $1000.\nThis month, you will achieve them and get paid $1000.\nNext month, you do the same shit and get paid $500.\nSo you increase it in month three and get $350.\nBut in month four, you\u2019re so tired of trying that you don\u2019t know what works anymore, you end up earning $2500. That\u2019s 250% from your target!\nThis is an internet career in a nutshell for you.\nThe only thing that\u2019ll help you show up is if you\u2019re in love with what you\u2019re doing and the purpose behind it. That's the only motivation to carry on and stay strong even if things go downhill.\nAnd another thing\u2026\nYou *Need* Multiple Income Sources\nThis is the only thing that\u2019ll save you. While you won\u2019t be dive into it instantly, keep it at the back of your head from day one.\nMy income sources (so far) include:\nconsulting\nmy course\npaid community\naffiliate marketing\nthree digital products\nan online writing platform\na freebie that people sometimes donate to\nlow effort, high-impact gigs (e.g. website copy)\nSo if one of them goes down, the others help me balance it out.\nFor example, I am not conducting my course for three months now to take some time off, but then I can focus on scaling other income sources that\u2019ll help me.\nMultiple income streams don\u2019t happen overnight. So don\u2019t be too hard on yourself, but be on the lookout for opportunities.\nPro tip: if you take a course that you really enjoyed and got results from, ask the course instructor if you can be an affiliate. The worst answer is only \u2018no\u2019, which isn\u2019t so bad.\nIf they say yes, that's an additional income stream right there.\nBut\u2026\nMoney-Focussed Decisions Can Be Tempting\nWho in their right mind will not conduct their course for three straight months when it's bringing in a good chunk of money?\nMe! Why? Mental health.\nSanity over scaling up.\nWhen you get traction, it is tempting to keep releasing products.\nIt\u2019s tempting to sell to your mailing list (please don\u2019t be that spammer). It\u2019s tempting to do what\u2019s worked so far again and again to make money until you burn out.\nZoom out and look at the bigger picture. You\u2019re a one-person business. There is no way you can lose the CEO. You need to be fit to make decisions that serve you long term.\nIf you\u2019re losing yourself, it\u2019s better to lose a bit of money that you can make later on instead.\nThere\u2019s So Much Money to Be Made!\nI\u2019ve mentioned a few of my income streams, but there\u2019s another one I\u2019m working on, though I\u2019ll probably do it next year.\nBecause I launched my first digital product only seven months ago. And since then, I\u2019ve launched three products, two freebies, and one course. It\u2019s important to space out to grow sustainably.\nWhat nobody tells you about being a creator is that there's lots of money to be made. There\u2019s so much you can do.\nThis isn\u2019t where you\u2019re paid for certain hours of work. It\u2019s where you\u2019re paid directly for impact.\nJustin Welsh, a person I look up to and admire, has made $125,377.50 within 16 days of launching his course. I purchased this one (Content OS) too because it solves a big issue for me \u2014 how to ace multiple platforms with a system.\nThere are thousands of others like him who\u2019ve tapped into the creator economy and made it big. Think of YouTubers.\nIt's a big, big place which has a seat for everybody. Consider joining in.\nI love what I do.\nMondays are no longer anxious and I\u2019m driven by a purpose.\nBut of course, I have my lows too. It can be very tiring and your mental health takes a toll even if you\u2019re working 4 hours a day. Because the brain doesn\u2019t stop thinking.\nSo this is an insight into what it's like.\nIn my opinion, what separates it from others is that the highs are too high and the lows are terribly low. And also that\u2019s it makes \u2018work\u2019 so much fun!\nClick here to grab your free Side Hustler Checklist.\nIf you enjoyed reading this, you might relish:\nDon\u2019t Fall Into These 4 Traps if You Want to Have a Career Online\nLet me show you a way out of them.medium.com", "comment_count": 9, "like_count": 436, "created_time": 1649401404540, "comment": [{"user_id": "7d8341a13e2c", "comment_time": 1649401404540, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "2b89108774eb", "comment_time": 1649956692472, "comment": "That's exactly how I feel.

Here Are 3 Things I\u2019ve Learned.\nIt changed the way I\u2019ll view \u2018work\u2019 forever.\nPhoto by RODNAE Productions from Pexels\nA year ago, I resigned from my 9\u20135 at 24 years old with under 3 years of work experience. Adding to that, it was during the bat virus when people around me were losing jobs.\nWhat a stupid decision, right?\nBut I wish I could tell you how I felt while working. I constantly felt I\u2019m in the wrong place. Nothing interested me or energised me enough to give in my 100%. I was uninspired and bored.\nI didn\u2019t understand the corporate sector either. The data crunching and PowerPoints, stepping on others to climb up at snail\u2019s pace and get adequate money only a few years later.\nMade no sense.\nAnd after overdosing on self-improvement related stuff and actually implementing the learnings thanks to work-from-home that gave us more time, I felt I\u2019m capable of so much more.\nIt felt like a superpower.\nSo I left the \u2018safe job\u2019.\nIt\u2019s been nine months since then and a year since I handed in my resignation. Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve learned.\nLesson 1: True contentment lies in being of service to others.\nNobody makes money because they want money.\nAnd no amount of money will make you as happy as creating impact.\nLuckily, I already worked very hard on making mindset shifts while I side-hustled during my 9\u20135. I worked on creating a \u2018growth mindset\u2019 which says there\u2019s enough for everybody.\nI also prioritised value over vanity metrics like followers, likes, or money.\n\u201cConnect, create meaning, make a difference, matter, be missed.\u201d \u2014 Seth Godin\nThis helped me when I went all-in into my side hustle because I didn\u2019t care as much about making money or hitting followers as much as I did about being valuable to my audience.\nWhen people DM you about how you\u2019ve helped them, that will completely change how you view your \u2018work\u2019.\nLesson 2: We all have the force in us to live the life we desire.\nWhat is stopping you? Most of the time, it\u2019s you.\nIt\u2019s the easiest for us to sabotage our own success. Think of:\n\u201cThat person just got lucky.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m capable of it.\u201d\n\u201cWhether you think you can, or you think you can\u2019t, you\u2019re right.\u201d \u2014 Henry Ford\nAnd most of the time, there\u2019s a lack of desire. You don\u2019t believe that your life will change because everybody around you follows the same pattern for education, work, and family.\nYet you envy those who live differently?\nThey\u2019re not lucky. They believe in the possibility.\nAnd then they work to make it happen. They bridge the gap between their current state and their desires.\nBecome more self-aware via meditation or journaling, read, learn from people, and implement. The tools and techniques already exist, but you have to put in the work.\nOr whine, and stay the same.\nLesson 3: When you become ridiculously good at your skill, the numbers flow in.\nThese numbers can be followers, likes, money \u2014 whatever makes your orgasm.\nSince I worked on my mindset shifts during side hustling for 10 months, I knew that I have zero control over the results, so worrying about it is self-sabotage again.\nBut I have control over my process, my output, and learning and improving my skill. And when that's good enough, everything else will follow.\nAnd it did.\n\u201cTo double your income, triple your investment in self-development.\u201d \u2014 Robin Sharma\nIt\u2019s when I hit millions of views on LinkedIn, built an audience on Twitter, and made good five figures on Medium in my first year.\nIt all comes your way when you\u2019re least expecting it.\nFocus on what's in your control and don\u2019t get too attached to the outcome. It\u2019ll make you excellent at your skill but also keep you mentally sane.\nHow It\u2019s Been So Far\nThere\u2019ve been ups and downs.\nClients abruptly ending contracts, and lots of anxiety coupled with self-doubt.\nThere was also a time when I became too ambitious with everything going well and realised I have to choose sanity over scaling up.\nBut the direction has only been uphill even with the pitfalls.\nI never in my dreams imagined I\u2019ll sell a product or have it in me to have cohort-based courses that people enjoy. But it happens.\nThe creator economy has made me realise that the world is a platter of opportunities. There\u2019s so much you can do!\nIt\u2019s been one ride that I\u2019m grateful for everyday.\nLastly\nTaking gigantic leaps in life is always scary.\nThere\u2019s one life, and we all have a choice on how we want to live it. It won\u2019t always be an easy choice or the one people around you agree with, but you deserve to live how you want to and be happy.\nHowever, you also ought to be of service to those around you.\nIf you can improve somebody\u2019s life or help them in some way, why would you keep that away?\nGrow and help others grow. Whatever you do, keep the greater good in your mind.\nIt\u2019s good to aim to make money, but also have the right intention behind it.\nIt\u2019ll be a life you\u2019ll live with greater contentment and happiness.\nYou can create that life.\n\u201cTwenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didn\u2019t do than by the ones you did. So throw off the bowlines, sail away from the safe harbor, catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover.\u201d \u2014 Mark Twain\nClick here to grab your free Side Hustler Checklist.

What a sight, what a moment, what a shot. One that I would not get, one that I refused to get. My camera is left dangling there, no longer an extension of my me, just a hardware sidekick.\nNormally, it\u2019d be fixed in front of my eye, me trying to cradle the world into one shot. Desperate for a decent composition I\u2019d contort and bend myself in ways that would seriously concern Olympic gymnasts. Anything to get what I wanted out of this landscape, in the pursuit of the fleeting, and wanting to make time standstill. However noble I make this sound \u2014 I basically just want a damn good photo.\nLately, I\u2019m doing this less and less, or rather, with more consideration. Not for the lighting, or angle, but for what I\u2019m sacrificing by practicing such fervent documentation. Every piece about the internet will pontificate about the harm of always being on social media and attached to our phones, but this isn\u2019t that piece. I am merely taking stock of myself and my engagement with what\u2019s beyond the lens.\nBeing the photographer of your group means you\u2019re expected to always be at the ready to snap the best, most snackable content for everyone to then post. There may be the mom, the partier, and the asocial ones of all bands of friends, but now there is also a social media manager. Somehow, probably due to my own incessant need to carry an actual camera around, I became that one. Dutifully, I filled this role for them and myself, until now.\nI love what photography has given me. A keen and inquisitive eye for the spaces I occupy, and how everything can look like a still from a movie once your senses are tuned to that enough. I love being able to walk into a room and spot the scene for a good photograph, that makes walking around this life much more exciting and interesting. Although, it also creates a distance.\nIf I\u2019m always in search of a photograph at any given moment, then when am I taking the time to actually just be? Existence in the present is a lifelong struggle for most of us, and it\u2019s made even harder by attaching a camera to your hip for any occasion. Walks in the park are not made any greener, hangouts with friends are not made more fun, and parties are not made more celebratory because of me taking photos. So, what am I doing?\nAll these questions and more I ask myself every time I go to pick my camera up. Does this really need to be memorialized? Is this going to take away from my enjoyment of this? A digitized scrapbook is not a replacement for lived experience, no matter how much we try to convince ourselves of this. I love being a photographer and sharing my work, but not at the expense of interacting more physically, socially, and consciously. I feel as if I\u2019ve turned into a tourist of Earth rather than a participant.\nMake no mistake, I will still be snapshotting my way through the world, but gone is the obligation. Beauty, in all its forms, can be restored to just that. Not everything has to be a photo op or a publicity stunt. I believe in my photography, I feel a sense of confidence about it that I lack in most other areas of my life, and it is that faith that reassures this new philosophy. My work will not suffer by reabsorbing myself into the grand mess of life.\nInstead, I would like to think it will do the opposite. If I want to be a better creative then there is nothing better than getting into the dirt with everyone else. I can\u2019t do that behind a piece of plastic and gears. There is something lost when just being a voyeur. The thought of looking back at my catalog of work and seeing everyone else living life while I hid behind this camera has created a catalyst in me that I want to ride into a more involved partaking of the human experience. That can only be good for art, even necessary.\nThe bird has flown off, and the sun has hidden away for another day, but I still stand here. Under the umbrella of stars, I place my camera onto the ground and walk out into the still night, unbeknownst to the internet, to you, to anyone really and I have to say I don\u2019t feel as if I\u2019m missing anything at all. I am not taking a photograph \u2014 this moment will be all mine.\nIn a completely hypocritical turn, if you would like to see some of my photographic work just look below:\nIn Awe of Autumn\nJoining the choir of praise for the season of change.medium.com\nThe Garden of Lost Things\nSmall delights in the field of the forgottenmedium.com", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 273, "created_time": 1648490489525, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Blue Insights", "Life", "Photography", "Art", "Life Lessons"]}, {"author": "Charlie Cole", "post_id": "a91f28f6309b", "user_id": "356ce679ae", "title": "Rage In Bloom", "content": "Rage In Bloom\nA painting of floral fits\n\u00a9 Charlie Cole\nAcrylic and marker on canvas.\n@2020.

For several years I was a law student by day and a waitress by night.\nHaving received a diploma, I did not find a well-paying job in my specialty, and decided to keep working in catering. Mariupol is a small city. So for nine years I met many people and knew what every corner of the city breathes.\nMy salary was small, but it allowed me to travel around Ukraine and save a little for a dog and for the renovation of my apartment in the central part of the city. I was satisfied with my job, my city, and my measured life.\nI wasn\u2019t going to change anything. When the distant explosions began on February 24, we didn\u2019t think it would get worse. We\u2019d been through this previously in 2014. It didn\u2019t last long back then and the city survived.\nHowever, two days later things got more difficult and the explosions continued over and over again. The city was never silent. Yet we kept on living and stocked up on basic products. Gas stations and shops were still working in the city.\nA line to a Mariupol grocery store. First days of war.\nFirst, the power and the cell networks went out.\nWe managed to charge our phones in time, but without a mobile connection, we lost all means to get any information. So we were taking risks and going out into the city to find out at least something. Soon, all of the stores and pharmacies nearby got empty because of looting.\nWe witnessed children and adults dying because they had no insulin or medicines. People were suffering from easily treatable illnesses. A familiar soldier involved in the city resistance died of pneumonia simply due to a lack of drugs.\nThe only store still working was located in the front zone. People were coming and forming a line to that store, even though our military forces chased them away. And then five projectiles flew right into that line. When my boyfriend and I came there the next day, casualties were lying all around.\nThe line to the only working store left in the front zone.\nI looked at the bodies and thought: those people, they are not even soldiers. These are citizens. This could have been someone\u2019s father. Someone\u2019s son. This isn\u2019t normal. Yet we continued to live like it was a normal thing.\nThen the water supply was gone.\nRussian troops began to bomb the places where we could get water. Once we managed to get a few bottles of water, and the next day that location was shelled and dead people were scattered all around. We faced a choice between life and water.\nWe started to melt the snow. We gathered the wastewater. But it was running out so quickly. We used the same water to cook two eggs on the bonfire in the courtyard, then wash our socks, and then flush the toilet.\nThree days later, the authorities turned off the gas supply. Before the gas was turned off, we melted wax to make new candles.\nOur handmade candles.\nDespite the tightly closed windows, the temperature in the apartment dropped to 4 degrees celsius.\n\u201cIt\u2019s so cold I can see my breath,\u201d I told my boyfriend once.\n\u201cNo way.\u201d\n\u201cLook then!\u201d I rounded my lips and released a clearly visible cloud of vapor.\nI realized it was no longer possible to stay in the city when they began destroying its central part. The hospital. The uni. The courthouse. I lived close to all these buildings. They seemed so indestructible. And now, often only a single wall remained of each of them, surrounded by the craters two stories deep.\nThe bombing became so frequent we didn\u2019t go out to the city anymore. Life was getting more and more depressing. When we went to bed, we didn\u2019t know if we would wake up in the morning. And when we did wake up, we didn\u2019t know if we were still part of Ukraine.\nWe asked each other about the news, but no one knew anything. It seemed like we were abandoned. Forgotten. At times, someone would dash through our courtyard from another block just to report that that block no longer exists.\nEven if the authorities took some actions and organized some trains for evacuation or humanitarian corridors, there was no way for us to find out about it.\nWe couldn\u2019t even contact close relatives or friends to tell them we are alive. I only have my mom, who moved to the village of Bezymianne to take care of my grandmother. This village is 40 minutes drive from Mariupol, but since 2014, it has been occupied by Russia. The last time I saw my mother was four years ago and she had to make a detour through Rostov and Kharkiv just to come visit me. The trip way too expensive and exhausting for her.\nOne of those horrible days in Mariupol, I wrote her a farewell note. The thought of it reaching my mom cheered me up a bit because I knew I wouldn\u2019t have another opportunity to say goodbye.\nCommon grief united us with neighbors. I shared my books with them. \u041ene would read a book and then retell it to those around the bonfire. Others shared batteries, lighters, breakfast cereal, and took care of the elderly who couldn\u2019t leave the house. One of our aging neighbors, who was a teacher for most of her life, wouldn\u2019t eat anything. She fed the local cats instead. Another old woman gave us a wooden kitchen board to support the bonfire.\nWe tried to keep the bonfire burning at all times because it was difficult and time-consuming to start a new fire from scratch. The brushwood for the fire was often wet and it took a day to dry it up before burning.\nMy courtyard as seen from my window.\nWhen the kindergarten near our building got bombed, we went there to take a few chairs for our basement shelter. I came in and noticed a row of kids\u2019 slippers. It struck me: I\u2019m stealing from children.\nThis war forced us to do unthinkable things.\nLater we used the children\u2019s lockers to maintain the fire. During my last days in Mariupol, the sky was burning all the time. I was sure this was the end. I saw new destruction every day. Russia\u2019s army was getting closer and closer. I realized it was unlikely that my house would remain intact while the whole city would get destroyed.\nOnce, I looked out of the window. Our U-shaped building already had three holes in it. Suddenly, I noticed someone\u2019s blanket fluttering on a tree in the courtyard. I turned my head and saw a balcony, from which this blanket must have flown out. The apartment was turned inside out because of the explosion. I wondered if someone was home at the moment of impact. Should I look for them? But if anyone was home, they couldn\u2019t survive The apartment was completely burned out.\nOn March 13, we went up stairs for a while, and then the neighbors knocked on the door:\n\u201cThere\u2019s a way to leave the city along the quay. We depart in 15 minutes. Are you with us?\u201d\nWe grabbed our backpacks, threw them into their car trunk, and drove off. I was sure we wouldn\u2019t make it. The unfinished food remained on the kitchen table. We even left our laptops behind.\nWe drove out of the city without any checkpoints on our way. The road was planted with mines, but the mines were visible. It seemed suicidal, but we successfully bypassed them while I sat in the car scared to death.\nWhen we were approaching Berdiansk, I joyfully noticed: \u201cLook, there\u2019s a car line coming at us!\u201d\nThat would mean the road ahead is clear. But this car line wasn\u2019t moving. It was gunned down. Driving by, I spotted clothes, wet wipes, other everyday things inside these cars.\nWhen we reached the Russian checkpoint near Berdiansk, the military began to gather the approaching cars into a line. It seemed that they were doing this to shoot us all at once, but they just wanted to let us through in an organized manner.\nWe encountered 13 to 15 such Russian checkpoints \u043en the way to Zaporizhzhia. Every time, they examined and checked each of us. They took our phones, money, water, food. This delayed us a lot, so we tried to get at least somewhere before the curfew.\nThe Russians asked us to keep their thefts a secret, and, at the same time, they asked: \u201cWhy are you going to Ukraine, and not to our territory, or Donetsk, Lugansk?\u201d We avoided the conflict and answered that we were going to our Ukrainian relatives, or that we were from Ukraine.\nI still didn\u2019t believe that we would get anywhere. We were hungry, we were freezing, we had no shower for 20 days. And we were surround by armed people. At any moment, things could go terribly wrong. At one of the checkpoints, I saw a guy with his machine gun aimed straight at me. I had only one thought: God forbid his hands get sweaty.\nWhen we had almost reached Zaporizhzhia, and the lights of the city lured us on the horizon, we discovered that the bridge we had to pass over had been destroyed.\nThe ruined bridge to Zaporizhzhia.\nA man with the most fuel in the tank found a narrow detour road nearby and went to inspect it. When he returned, he said:\n\u201cThe route is mined, but we can drive through. We have to drive one by one, wheel to wheel, following the leading car\u2019s track. And we should keep our distance so that if one car explodes the others won\u2019t be affected.\u201d\nWe decided to go even though our car owner wasn\u2019t a seasoned driver yet. When following the route, we tried not to breathe. In my mind, I was recalling all the Saints I could.\nThe saying goes, there are no atheists during the war. I get it now.\nWhen it began to get dark, we finally met the Ukrainian military. At that time we formed a long line of cars.\n\u201cWho are you all?\u201d Ukrainian soldiers asked us at the checkpoint.\n\u201cWe\u2019re from Mariupol.\u201d\nThey were struck dumb.\nAfter the ID check, the soldiers called a police patrol to escort us. With endless barbed wires, cinder blocks, and mined tires on the road we again had to drive very carefully and with the headlights off.\nSeveral drivers were running out of patience. In the dark, they decided to overtake the line from the flank, and I saw them crashed into cinder blocks.\nWe finally reached Zaporizhzhia. Days later, I rented an apartment in Dnipro.\nI\u2019m safe. I\u2019m okay now.\nBut I still can\u2019t believe my former life is gone.", "comment_count": 79, "like_count": 7253, "created_time": 1648365742583, "comment": [{"user_id": "d129c10c55f5", "comment_time": 1648365742583, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "267b63d5d66", "comment_time": 1648667546947, "comment": "You have lived through a harrowing time.

The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine June 23, looked at the Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca vaccines.\nNo vaccine can prevent 100% of all infections, so there will always be some \u201cbreakthrough cases\u201d in vaccinated people \u2014 Covid-19 infections in people who received a Covid vaccine. These infections are more likely in people who aren\u2019t yet fully vaccinated, such as those who have only gotten their first dose of a Covid vaccine or who got their second dose less than two weeks before exposure to the virus.\nBut even during those vulnerable periods before they have the most protection possible against Covid, partially vaccinated people are still much less likely to transmit the virus to those they live with, researchers found.\nWhat the study found\nThe study took place in England in January and February 2021. The researchers first looked at how many secondary cases occurred in the households of unvaccinated people who developed Covid-19. Out of nearly a million people who lived with someone who developed Covid-19 while not vaccinated, about 10% developed Covid-19. In other words, one out of every 10 household members got Covid if they lived with someone who had Covid and hadn\u2019t gotten the vaccine.\nThen the scientists compared that number to how many secondary cases occurred in households where someone had received at least one dose of a Covid vaccine but developed an infection more than three weeks later. Very few of the people in their study had been fully vaccinated: 93% had only received the first dose of a vaccine.\nOut of 3,424 people who lived with someone who had Covid-19 after receiving at least one dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine, only 5.7% (of the household members) also caught Covid-19. People who got a dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and caught Covid-19 lived with 5,939 people, and only 6.2% of those household members caught Covid-19.\nThe study could not guarantee that infected household members got Covid from the sick person living with them. However, the researchers only looked at household infections that occurred within 2 to 14 days after the first person had a positive test, and the study occurred when much of the country was still remaining at home. That means it\u2019s pretty unlikely that very many people got Covid from somewhere else when they were at home most of the time with someone who had Covid. (And even if they did, that means the vaccine was even more effective at preventing someone from passing Covid on to those they lived with.)\nThe researchers also took into account other factors that might have impacted transmission of the virus, including the age and sex of people with the first and second infections. They also considered how big the household was, the day of the week that the first person got sick, where the household was (geographically), and the socioeconomic status of the household.\n\u201cOverall, the likelihood of household transmission was approximately 40 to 50% lower in households of index patients who had been vaccinated 21 days or more before testing positive than in households of unvaccinated index patients,\u201d the researchers wrote.\nTo understand this better, consider the example of Bob and John: Bob gets a dose of either the Pfizer-BioNTech or AstraZeneca vaccine. John hasn\u2019t received any Covid vaccine. Three weeks later, Bob and John both get Covid. Bob is half as likely as John to infect someone he lives with \u2014 his wife or husband, his mother or father, his kids\u2014 even though both are sick with Covid.\nWhat the study means\nWhat does this mean? The sooner you receive your first dose of a vaccine, the sooner you\u2019re protecting your family members from Covid even if you still end up sick. While this study focused on the AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines, it probably holds true for the Moderna vaccine as well since it\u2019s so similar to the Pfizer one and has shown similar data for effectiveness. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine is similar to the AstraZeneca vaccine, but it\u2019s only a single dose instead of two, and it\u2019s not clear if these findings would apply to the J&J vaccine.\nUnfortunately, the database the researchers used did not have any information on symptoms, so we don\u2019t know if the people who caught Covid from a partially vaccinated household member had symptoms any better, worse, or different than people who caught Covid from an unvaccinated household member.\nThe authors point out, however, that people who had been partially vaccinated were likely to have fewer symptoms and therefore \u201cmight have been less infectious than those who were unvaccinated.\u201d That\u2019s because other research has found that people who received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and later got Covid had four times less virus in their system (viral load) than people who didn\u2019t receive any vaccine. People who have fewer viruses in their body are less likely to infect others around them.", "comment_count": 6, "like_count": 280, "created_time": 1625012116492, "comment": [{"user_id": "d84a7f9d2fe6", "comment_time": 1625012116492, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "eb0b9cd0e82c", "comment_time": 1625243140671, "comment": "Is there data yet that looks at transmission rates after full vaccination?"}, {"user_id": "3ad638fd3b47", "comment_time": 1626014826552, "comment": "Hi"}, {"user_id": "57ce30414fc1", "comment_time": 1625234177970, "comment": "Which means two doses have to be even better."}, {"user_id": "2d8f7d17ae1d", "comment_time": 1625223984840, "comment": "Nice job Tara.

But it was everything else about the pandemic that has had the biggest impact \u2014 the loneliness, the isolation, the fear, the uncertainty.\nAgain, none of this is news, but I worry that reporting on newly published data from the CDC will miss two key important points:\nFirst, teens\u2019 mental health was already in crisis well before the pandemic began, and not many folks were paying much attention to it until \u201ckids\u2019 mental health\u201d suddenly became a talking point to push various agendas related to restrictions.\nSecond, while school connectedness definitely mitigated much of the pandemic\u2019s mental health harm to kids, there were still kids who didn\u2019t benefit from school or experienced more bullying, and it\u2019s undoubtedly the case that teens would be struggling with the effects of the pandemic whether they were in school or not. In other words, school is a protective factor \u2014 which is why it was so important to keep schools safe with mask requirements, appropriate contact tracing, and improved ventilation \u2014 but it\u2019s not a panacea.\nBleak Findings about Teen Mental Health\nThe new CDC findings come from an online survey conducted from January to June 2021 among 7,705 high school students who answered 110 questions about everything from accidental injury, self harm, bullying, violence, and suicidal thoughts to smoking, alcohol and drug use, sexual behaviors, and diet. The questions asked not only about individual respondents\u2019 behaviors but also about their perceptions of their peers\u2019 behaviors during the pandemic.\nThe students were about evenly divided among freshmen, sophomores, juniors, and seniors, and self-identified sex was split 50/50. Half the students were white, a quarter were Hispanic, 13% were Black, 5% were Asian, 6% were multiracial. Three out of four respondents identified themselves as heterosexual while 13% identified as LGBT and 9% said they were \u201cother or questioning.\u201d\nAmong the 128 schools that participated from across the U.S., three out of four had a hybrid instructional mode (a mix of in-person and online instruction) while 22% used only online instruction and 3% used only in-person instruction. Importantly, the responses only reflect those teens who were enrolled in school and not those who were home schooled or in alternative arrangements, which was about 5% of all teens age 14\u201317 in 2018 and probably higher during 2021. The survey also can\u2019t show cause and effect. All it can do is provide a snapshot in time of how teens felt and perceived things around them.\nThe findings revealed that 37% of high school students had poor mental health during the pandemic, and 44% felt \u201cpersistently felt sad or hopeless during the past year.\u201d However, it\u2019s worth noting that data from 2019 showed that 37% of teens \u201cexperienced persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness.\u201d Moving from 37% to 44% is an increase, but it was already pretty darn high well before SARS-CoV-2 came along and disrupted our lives.\nParticularly concerning was the toll the pandemic took on teens in terms of abuse from others: more than half (55%) said they experienced emotional abuse by a parent or another adult in their household, which could include being cursed at, insulted, or put down. (Again, anyone who knows teens knows that conflict is a natural part of living with them, but that number is concerningly high even if we take into account some teens\u2019 occasionally outsized perception of how utterly unfair adults are to them.) One in ten (11%) experienced physical abuse from a parent or other adult at home. It\u2019s possible the stress from parents themselves played a role in this since nearly a third of teens (29%) said their parent or another adult in the home lost their job during the pandemic.\nSchool \u201cConnectedness\u201d Offsets the Problem\nThe good news was in the data about school connectedness: those who felt closest to adults and classmates from school were less likely to feel depressed, sad, hopeless, and lonely. They were also less likely to attempt or consider attempting suicide. More than half the teens who didn\u2019t feel connected to people at school (53%) felt persistently sad or hopeless, compared to just over a third (35%) of those who did have that sense of connection at school. A quarter of those who didn\u2019t feel connected (26%) had suicidal thoughts, compared to 14% who felt that sense of connection, and actual suicide attempts were twice as high (12% vs. 6%) in those who lacked the sense of belonging at school.\nThat seems to argue for the benefits of in-person school, but there are a couple key caveats here:\nFirst, 75% of the responses came from schools with a hybrid model, and there\u2019s not necessarily evidence that a sense of connectedness is stronger or better through in-person school than virtual school. It seems logical, but we need data before we can say it\u2019s true, and we have to consider the potential stress, anxiety, and uncertainty that students attending in-person school without adequate mitigation procedures may have experienced if they worried about themselves getting COVID or taking COVID home to a vulnerable family members.\nSecond, these findings are reasonable for feeling school connectedness vs. not feeling it regardless of whether a pandemic is occurring. (I mean, rewatch Breakfast Club or any other John Hughes movie!) Moreover, nearly half of all students (47%) said they didn\u2019t feel close to people at school during the pandemic.\nThe bottom line is that the data we have from these survey is still limited in what it can tell us, and we need more qualitative data to really make sense of the various contributors to poor teen mental health, from the pandemic and outside of the pandemic. What we can say without a doubt is that teens are in trouble, as they have been for a number of years now, and we need to be doing a lot more \u2014 A LOT MORE \u2014 to address their mental health needs and get them the support they need.", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 55, "created_time": 1648774385230, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Teens", "Depression", "Pandemic", "Mental Health", "Schools"]}, {"author": "Tara Haelle", "post_id": "ef279af697cf", "user_id": "d84a7f9d2fe6", "title": "COVID Vaccines Still Dramatically Reduce Severe COVID, Hospitalization, and Death", "content": "COVID Vaccines Still Dramatically Reduce Severe COVID, Hospitalization, and Death\nEven against Omicron, vaccination offers substantial protection against the worst outcomes of COVID, even in people with previous infections.\nPhoto by Bra\u0148o on Unsplash\nTwo or three doses of mRNA COVID vaccines reduce the risk of death or needing a ventilator by 90%, even against Omicron, according to new research from the CDC. In addition, a study published today in Lancet Infectious Diseases found that, in people who have already had COVID, vaccination with any of four major vaccines (including two available in the U.S.) cut risk of another bout of COVID in half while reducing risk of hospitalization from COVID by 80% to 90%, depending on the vaccine.\nBoth sets of findings are encouraging because they provide more evidence about the benefit of vaccination in preventing the worst outcomes of COVID, even if they do not always prevent mild disease or the ability of someone infected to transmit the virus to others. The second study also provides more evidence that even people who have natural immunity from a previous COVID infection can benefit from vaccination.\nOverly High Expectations of Vaccines\nIn a way, the early success of COVID mRNA vaccines in preventing not only COVID-19 disease but also SARS-CoV-2 infection has made it harder for some people to trust in the benefit of vaccination now. It was only for a brief couple of months in early 2021 that mRNA vaccines were found to block infection and transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and only against the variants circulating at that time. That was great, exciting news. It just didn\u2019t last.\nBy the time Delta arrived, a combination of vaccine immunity waning and characteristics of the Delta variant meant that vaccination still dramatically reduced risk of infection, disease, hospitalization, death and even some transmission \u2014 but we learned it was possible for a vaccinated person with Delta-variant COVID to transmit the disease to others, though it happened less frequently than if they hadn\u2019t been vaccinated. That trend continued with the Omicron wave.\nThe vaccines were no longer the super-awesome rock stars they had been. Instead, the mRNA COVID vaccines worked\u2026 as nearly every other vaccine we have works: they prevent disease, hospitalization, and severe outcomes, and they reduce \u2014 but cannot eliminate \u2014 risk of transmission. As Katherine Wu wrote back in September, we\u2019ve been asking too much of COVID vaccines from the beginning. Sterilizing immunity \u2014 the ability of a vaccine to completely prevent a virus from taking hold at all in a person \u2014 is extremely rare.\nMost vaccines we have can\u2019t necessarily prevent a person from developing an infection, where the virus or bacteria takes hold and begins to replicate. Even the measles vaccine, one of the most effective we have, can possibly allow very mild or asymptomatic infections, and it remains one of the very few that can prevent most transmission. Rather, vaccines prepares the body to attack the pathogen so early on that it\u2019s destroyed before it can cause disease and, often but not always, before the person has enough of the pathogen in them to pass it along to others.\nmRNA Vaccination Dramatically Reduces Risk of Death\nBut the most important goal of vaccination has always been to reduce severe disease and death, and that\u2019s exactly what the latest evidence shows the vaccines do very, very well. Most previous research has focused on reduction in hospitalization from COVID, but the new study, published March 25, looks at reductions in death and use of a ventilator.\nThe researchers used a case-control study design. In this type of study, researchers look at two groups of people: those who experience the outcome being studied (in this case, those who had COVID and died or needed a ventilator within 28 days of being hospitalized) and demographically similar hospitalized patients who didn\u2019t have COVID. Then they compare how many were vaccinated in each group.\nThe data came from 7,544 adults at 21 US medical centers between March 11, 2021 and January 24, 2022, which includes the Alpha, Delta, and Omicron waves and their peaks. About one in five (21%) of the 1,440 adult COVID patients who died or needed a ventilator had received two or three doses of an mRNA vaccine. Among the 6,104 comparison patients without COVID, two thirds (66%) had received two or three vaccine doses. The vaccinated COVID patients who died were older, more likely to be immune-compromised, and had more chronic medical conditions compared to unvaccinated COVID patients.\nThe researchers calculated that, overall, receiving two or three doses of mRNA vaccine reduced the risk of dying or needing a ventilator by 90%. The reduced risk was slightly lower for two doses (88%) and higher for three doses (94%). The 94% reduced risk for death or ventilation from three shots remained throughout the Omicron wave.\nVaccination Adds Protection to Natural Immunity\nIn the study out today from Lancet Infectious Diseases, another case-control design used data from Brazil to assess the effect of four different vaccines on people with a prior COVID infection from January to November 2021. The vaccines included the Pfizer mRNA vaccine and the Johnson & Johnson vaccine \u2014 both available in the U.S. \u2014 and the AstraZeneca and CoronaVac vaccines that the FDA has not authorized in the U.S.\nOut of 167,621 patients with a past infection of COVID included in the study, 22,566 had a COVID reinfection, and 68,426 similar patients did not. Then the researchers compared vaccination rates between the two groups. The patients without reinfection had been matched to those with an infection in terms of demographics or characteristics to reduce the likelihood that other factors besides vaccination contributed to differences in reinfection, hospitalization, or death. (This study method, called a test-negative design, is the gold standard for assessing vaccine effectiveness in the real world and is used to measure flu vaccine effectiveness as well.)\nThe researchers found the following about each vaccine\u2019s effectiveness:\nThe Pfizer vaccine cut risk of reinfection by more than half (65%) and risk of hospitalization by 90% in those with natural immunity from a prior infection.\nAstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine reduced risk of reinfection by 56% and hospitalization by 90%.\nJ&J\u2019s vaccine reduced risk of reinfection by 44% and risk of hospitalization by 58%.\nThe CoronaVac vaccine reduced risk of reinfection by 39% and risk of hospitalization by 81%.\nSince this study did not include the Omicron wave in Brazil, it\u2019s hard to determine how the data would hold up in people with a previous Omicron infection or with a pre-Omicron infection who are exposed to Omicron. However, considering the data from the Pfizer mRNA vaccine in this study and the mRNA data in the CDC study, it seems highly likely that mRNA vaccination reduces risk of Omicron reinfection and hospitalization even in people with natural immunity from a previous COVID infection.", "comment_count": 1, "like_count": 2, "created_time": 1648772412242, "comment": [{"user_id": "d84a7f9d2fe6", "comment_time": 1648772412242, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "1032af7cb8ff", "comment_time": 1649021873130, "comment": "Are you giving out medical advice?

But even at the time, Gov. Gavin Newsom didn\u2019t really explain how it was determined that Omicron was now endemic or even what that actually meant in practical terms, especially when Omicron BA.2 cases may be threatening another COVID bump, albeit less than those of Delta or Omicron BA.1.\nArmchair epidemiologists have been saying on social media for months that COVID is or soon will be endemic, but many of them seem to think that means COVID has become less dangerous and that we stop efforts to control the spread of it.\nInstead, as Kent State University epidemiologist Tara Smith told me, endemic simply means \u201csomething we\u2019re stuck with.\u201d That is, COVID will \u201cremain with us for the foreseeable future, and we can (roughly) predict the number of cases and deaths it will cause in a year\u2019s time.\u201d But that doesn\u2019t tell us what we should, or shouldn\u2019t, do about it.\nAfter all, flu has been endemic for over a century, and we still prepare for flu season every fall, starting with annual vaccination campaigns. HIV has been endemic for four decades, and scientists are still actively working on developing a vaccine because we haven\u2019t given up and decided to just \u201clive with it.\u201d\n\u201cRelatively Predictable\u201d\nTo make sense of what endemic actually means \u2014 and what it doesn\u2019t mean \u2014 I reached out to Smith and a couple other real (non-armchair) epidemiologists, first asking for examples of endemic diseases in the U.S. people are familiar with. In addition to flu, whose cases fluctuate with mild or particularly deadly seasons, food-borne illnesses like E. coli or salmonella are endemic, Smith said, as are sexually transmitted infections like gonorrhea, HPV, syphilis, and chlamydia.\nThe most dangerous strains of HPV have declined since introduction of the HPV vaccine, but no vaccines exist for gonorrhea, syphilis, and chlamydia, however, and cases hit an all-time high for the sixth year in a row last year. Broadly speaking, then, endemic doesn\u2019t necessarily mean a disease can\u2019t be increasing to potentially alarming rates, even if the rise has been gradual and we\u2019ve been living with it for a long time.\nThere\u2019s not an exact threshold for determine when a disease reaches endemic status, Smith said. It\u2019s usually just when a disease \u201cbecomes predictable,\u201d which can involve \u201cincreases and drops, or \u2018waves,\u2019 of cases, but generally these become relatively predictable over time, such as the seasonality we see with influenza,\u201d Smith said. Few would say right now that COVID has reached a point where we consider it predictable.\nMatthew Fox, an epidemiologist at Boston University, agreed that there isn\u2019t necessarily a fully accepted precise definition for \u2018endemic.\u2019\n\u201dSome use it to mean contained to a specific area, but I think the more common meaning that people are using with respect to COVID is controlled at an acceptable level typically at a somewhat steady state (it can be seasonal but predictable),\u201d he said. But, he adds, \u201cWe have to define what we consider to be an acceptable level.\u201d And therein lies the rub.\n\u201cSome think even very low levels are not acceptable if it is leading to deaths,\u201d Fox said, while others seem to think endemic means \u201clow enough that I can not have it involved my daily life\u201d \u2014 hence when we can end restrictions. But it\u2019s not that simple. \u201cThe challenge is that we are likely to see rises and falls in cases for some time and we may want to take precautions when cases are rising and relax them when they are waning,\u201d he said, echoing Smith\u2019s point that \u201cwe don\u2019t know yet if it will settle into a predictable periodicity like we see with influenza.\u201d\nHistorical Perspective\nMonica Green, a medical historian previously at Arizona State University, said the meaning of endemic often fluctuates in her field, with researchers defining it for the particular time and place they\u2019re studying, but it still generally means \u201ca disease is commonly circulating in a given population or region.\u201d She pointed out that non-infectious diseases can be endemic too, such as diabetes, and she diseases no longer endemic in the U.S. are still be endemic and serious outside the U.S., like tuberculosis and malaria. But like Smith, she said determining when a disease crosses over into \u201cendemicity\u201d is trickier to answer. With endemic basically meaning the \u201cstatus quo,\u201d it hasn\u2019t typically had a time element to it, she said.\n\u201cThis is why discussions the past few weeks between historians and public health people have been so interesting, because the new usage presumes that you can watch a disease moving from introduction to a new population to epidemic surges to \u2018endemicity,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a very new concept.\u201d\nIn fact, she said, there\u2019s no historical precedent to watching in real time as a new disease enters the human population, circulates and leads to varying states of immunity from infection and vaccination, and gradually becomes endemic. \u201cWe\u2019ve never had a new disease and its vaccine come online in such quick succession before,\u201d she said. HIV, for example, doesn\u2019t yet have a cure or a vaccine, and Ebola didn\u2019t really become endemic even after a vaccine was developed.\nEndemic Doesn\u2019t Mean Harmless\nWhen I reached out to Dominique Heinke, a postdoctoral researcher and epidemiologist, she pointed me to the Nature article \u201cCOVID-19: endemic doesn\u2019t mean harmless,\u201d in which author Aris Katzourakis, a professor who studies viral evolution at the University of Oxford, described \u201cendemic\u201d in his first sentence as \u201cone of the most misused [words] of the pandemic.\u201d Again, he explained that endemic simply means disease rates are neither rising nor falling. Sure, the common cold is endemic and more a nuisance than a life-threatening illness for most people, but malaria is endemic too and killed more than 627,000 people in 2020.\n\u201cA disease can be endemic and both widespread and deadly,\u201d Katzourakis writes, but it\u2019s not \u201can excuse to do little or nothing,\u201d just as we don\u2019t sit by and let diseases like hepatitis C, malaria, or flu circulate as though we\u2019re helpless to do anything about them. \u201cStating that an infection will become endemic says nothing about how long it might take to reach stasis, what the case rates, morbidity levels or death rates will be or, crucially, how much of a population \u2014 and which sectors \u2014 will be susceptible,\u201d he writes.\nHeinke added that she agreed with colleagues, such as Green, Boston University epidemiologist Ellie Murray, and Johns Hopkins nursing and public health researcher Cec\u00edlia Tomori, that calling a disease endemic \u201ctells us nothing about severity or the need for protective measures nor is it an inevitable state of an infectious disease.\u201d Green, Murray, and Tomori spoke with COVID Calls in early February about the meaning of endemic and ways it\u2019s been misunderstood by the public. And one of the biggest of those misconceptions continues to be this idea that becoming endemic means we can just kick back and stop worrying about a disease.\n\u201dI think the assumption is that endemic means we no longer have to worry about it, or that endemic means mild. Neither is true,\u201d said Smith, who also mentioned malaria as a leading killer of children. \u201cEndemic means that we\u2019ll constantly have to deal with this infection. Maybe it will become more mild and fade into the background. Maybe it won\u2019t. We should be planning for multiple possible scenarios.\u201d\nAnd So\u2026 Now What?\nIn a way, the \u201ctrue, precise\u201d definition of endemic is almost irrelevant when people are using it in such different ways and for different agendas. If anything, the term has become a bit of a smokescreen to avoid dealing with the situation at hand, which is a disease that is still very much here and with us, even if rates are mercifully lower at the moment.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think \u2018endemic\u2019 adds anything to the conversation,\u201d Heinke said. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly being used to downplay the continued severity of COVID and provide cover for removing mitigation measures.\u201d\nFox implied a similar concern, that the lack of precision in the definition has meant that \u201cpeople use it to mean whatever they want it to mean,\u201d he said. \u201cSome want it to mean contained. Some want it to mean low level of transmission. Some want it to mean a stable level.\u201d It\u2019s not that any of those are correct or incorrect. Rather, \u201cI think we need to have a conversation about what metrics we will use to define easing restrictions.\u201d\nSmith agreed that \u201cwe need to have a real conversation about control, and how much resources we will be willing and able to dedicate to such.\u201d Mask mandates are gone throughout most of the country now, and the Biden administration recently allowed people to order their next batch of free at-home COVID tests. But funding is running out for free COVID testing, treatment and even vaccines, leaving uninsured people in a lurch.\n\u201cWhat will we have in the near and farther future regarding public availability of case and hospitalization counts? Will vaccines be mandated for K-12 schools?\u201d Smith asked. \u201cAll of these are aspects of ongoing disease control, but it is unclear if they will be funded or even available in every state as after the Omicron wave ends.\u201d\nAnd those are just questions in the U.S. Worldwide vaccination remains too low, and it\u2019s unclear how much help wealthy countries like the U.S. are going to offer to countries with fewer resources. If there\u2019s one thing the pandemic made clear, it\u2019s that the disease threatens every country as long as it threatens any countries.\n\u201cRight now, I think no one knows what the plan is going forward,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWe\u2019ve spent so much time responding to each crisis that a long-term plan hasn\u2019t been put forth.\u201d\nAnd while people continuing arguing over what endemic means and whether COVID is endemic or not, the questions that really matter go unanswered.", "comment_count": 1, "like_count": 103, "created_time": 1648689934402, "comment": [{"user_id": "d84a7f9d2fe6", "comment_time": 1648689934402, "comment": "What Does Endemic Actually Mean?"}, {"user_id": "57ce30414fc1", "comment_time": 1648825213308, "comment": "I also think people misunderstand that \"treating COVID like influenza\" doesn't mean ignoring COVID."}], "post_tag": ["Covid 19", "Coronavirus", "Endemic", "Omicron", "Disease"]}, {"author": "Audarshia Townsend", "post_id": "163621a33226", "user_id": "fc3e06460360", "title": "Black Foodways, Black Women, and Netflix\u2019s \u2018High on the Hog\u2019", "content": "New Column Alert: My Pen Is Mighty\nBlack Foodways, Black Women, and Netflix\u2019s \u2018High on the Hog\u2019\nWant to understand how African American cuisine transformed America? Ask a sista.\nA chef prepares a shrimp dish for the Netflix docuseries \u2018High on the Hog.\u2019 Image: Netflix\nJessica B. Harris is having a moment. It\u2019s been exactly 10 years since she wrote High on the Hog: A Culinary Journey from Africa to America. Now it\u2019s back on the New York Times Best Sellers List.\nThis is due to the rousing success of Netflix\u2019s High on the Hog travelogue series on how Black foodways have heavily impacted American cuisine. While the series dropped in late May, its historical context and poignant storylines will resonate with viewers for years to come. Women figure prominently in this series.\nIt begins, of course, with Harris, a PhD whose award-winning book inspired the show\u2019s deep dive. The esteemed culinary historian, who appears in \u201cOur Roots,\u201d the first episode of the four-part series, guides host/narrator Stephen Satterfield through the markets in Dantokpa, Benin, in West Africa. She discusses with him in great detail how soul food staples such as okra, black-eyed peas, rice, and yams (sweet potatoes in the U.S.) traveled centuries ago from West Africa to the United States to nourish the newly enslaved Africans. According to Harris, their captors packed these native foods on the boats.\nHarris is indeed a wealth of knowledge, and she clearly loves to share what she\u2019s learned from her many adventures on the continent. When she was the travel editor for Essence in the 1970s, she tells Satterfield, she found herself visiting Benin many times. That\u2019s also when she started making connections between African fare and Black American fare. Red palm rice, a staple in West Africa, for example, reminds her of jambalaya.\nHarris is so prominently featured throughout this first episode that she feels like the co-host. In addition to taking Satterfield to the market, she introduces him to popular Benin chef Valerie Vinakpon, the author of six cookbooks based on her native cuisine. They visit her restaurant, Saveurs du Benin (\u201cTaste of Benin\u201d), and indulge in traditional fare like grilled chicken accompanied by spicy tomato jam as well as lamb, red beans, and red palm oil.\nFood historian and author Jessica B. Harris, PhD walks with Stephen Satterfield in Benin. Image: Netflix\nThat\u2019s really all we get to know about Vinakpon, who I felt could have given us deeper knowledge about Beninese food from a native\u2019s perspective. Additionally, I was hungry for more background on this female chef\u2019s experience in such a male-dominated industry. It would have been interesting to see if her experiences mirrored that of her American counterparts.\nNevertheless, Harris deftly explains each dish to Satterfield and how it relates to American cuisine. Though her commanding presence was only in the first episode, it set an important tone for the series. I couldn\u2019t imagine her not being a part of High on the Hog, however, it was only by chance that she appeared in it at all. Bravo to director Roger Ross Williams for asking her because I\u2019m certain there would have been an uproar by the Black food community had she been left out.\nWatching women who look like me tell these important culinary stories with such authority, dignity, and finesse gives me chills. That\u2019s an area typically reserved for everyone else but us. During each scene with Black women experts ranging from preeminent culinary historians like Harris to chefs, food bloggers, and descendants of gastronomic pioneers, Satterfield appears to be in complete awe.\nAlso exhibiting supreme levels of Black girl magic is Gabrielle E.W. Carter. Considered a renaissance woman of Black foodways, she recently moved back to her hometown of Apex, North Carolina, from New York to continue her family\u2019s rich culinary legacy in farming. She is a chef and cultural preservationist as well as co-founder of Tall Grass Food Box, which helps Black-owned farmers in North Carolina with sustainability and economic issues.\nCarter appears in the second episode and introduces Satterfield to her family\u2019s sprawling farm, which they\u2019ve nurtured to prosperity for several generations. It will soon be displaced to make way for a new highway project. Carter is admirably part of a new generation of Black culinary leaders striving to keep Black farmers in business. She may not have been able to save her family\u2019s land, however, she may use it as a cautionary tale to help others avoid the same fate.\nAlso, the manner in which High on the Hog tied in the Juneteenth holiday \u2014 especially significant because it became a federal holiday only a few weeks after the series first aired \u2014 was emotional. During the fourth episode, they brought in Dallas-based Jerrelle Guy, a chef, photographer, and James Beard finalist for Black Girl Baking, to share her take on emancipation.\nGuy stresses that the kitchen gives her a sense of empowerment. And while that might sound a bit subservient, her explanation makes sense, particularly because she is a creative person. When she bakes traditional Black desserts such as apple pie made with brown butter or a four-layer cake infused with beets and topped with maple cream cheese frosting, it connects her to her heritage. These are the types of desserts Black female Texans have served to their loved ones for generations to commemorate Juneteenth.\nThe fourth episode also pays homage to two important Black women in culinary history while at the same time tying the series back to its African roots. Houston chef Chris Williams opened Lucille\u2019s as a tribute to his great-grandmother Lucille B. Smith, a cookbook author, businesswoman, and pioneering chef who created one of the country\u2019s first culinary education commercial curricula.\nIn the last scene of the series, which is at the restaurant, Williams hosts a dinner party for Toni Tipton Martin, the renowned food historian, editor-in-chief of Cook\u2019s Country magazine, and cookbook author who\u2019s won two James Beard Awards and the prestigious Julia Child Award. They\u2019re celebrating the success of her latest book, Jubilee, which meticulously explores African and African American foodways and celebrates them. Slow-roasted Senegalese lamb with groundnut sauce is one of several highlighted dishes served. Similar to Harris, Martin emphasizes the importance of acknowledging just how impactful African cuisine has been on American cuisine and culture.\nIn all, I just loved High on the Hog. By showcasing Harris, Carter, Tipton Martin, and others, important history lessons are served up while at the same time giving Black women our just due.", "comment_count": 1, "like_count": 317, "created_time": 1624922583092, "comment": [{"user_id": "fc3e06460360", "comment_time": 1624922583092, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "78c820b4c771", "comment_time": 1625600407114, "comment": "I watched this series.

You feel like you\u2019re along for the ride with them as they hit all the hot spots in Johannesburg. From the no-nonsense Khanyi Mbau (shown above), a South African businesswoman, actress, and media personality, to flamboyant Nigerian celebrity stylist Swanky Jerry, these elite African scenesters are now a global sensation.\nWhile Young, Famous & African showcases a rarely seen side of young professionals from the Motherland, I do wish that it was more substantive with its content during the seven episodes. South Africa is at the top of my bucket list, and it would have been nice to see more of its culture weaved into storylines.\nThere were missed opportunities to spotlight South African fashion designers, chefs, musicians, artists, alcoholic beverage brand owners, and so many more. For example, the clothing the stars wore was spectacular at every turn, but I wanted to know who was behind these fabulous frocks. [I did a deep dive after watching the show and discovered that South African stylist and fashion designer Phupho Gumede K styled their looks and many were by young South African fashion designers.]\nAdditionally, I would have loved to see some notable and insider landmarks. How can we virtually visit such an amazing city and not get a taste of the art museums, historic sites, or famed wineries? Also, there were plenty of close-ups on juicy meats being cooked on open hearths in several episodes. What were they eating? Steaks or more exotic red meats? That would have been nice to know.\nNevertheless, I dig overall what Young, Famous & African is giving, and here are five key reasons why you should be watching it, too.\nChampagne flows like water.\nThis group will gather for the opening of an envelope. Why? Because there is always Champagne ready to be poured. If you were to count every scene with bubbly, you\u2019d get exhausted. But who\u2019s complaining? From a relaxing spa day to afternoon tea to car shopping, every event calls for Champagne. They do also drink red wine, craft beer, and the occasional cocktail, but it\u2019s clear that bubbly is everyone\u2019s go-to drink of choice.\nPhoto by Ian Kiragu on Unsplash\n2. Though the majority of scenes takes place in Johannesburg, the cast mates represent several African countries and bring their rich cultures with them.\nIt\u2019s wonderful to watch them each embrace their cultures on the show. Mbau is South African and Swanky Jerry is Nigerian. There\u2019s also South African-Zimbabwean rapper Nadia Nakai, South African deejay Quinton Masina (Naked), Tanzanian entrepreneur Zari Hassan, Ethiopian entrepreneur Andile Ncube, Tanzanian pop star Diamond Platnumz, South African soccer player Kayleigh Schwark, and Nigerian entertainers Annie Macaulay-Idibia and Innocent \u201c2Baba\u201d Idibia, who are also wife and husband. During one scene, Diamond throws an \u201cArabian Nights\u201d-themed feast at his beautiful home. They each look like royalty as they wear clothing from their native lands, which is colorful and vibrant set against the alfresco dining backdrop.\n3. We finally get to see Africans living luxurious lifestyles in The Motherland.\nWe\u2019re accustomed to seeing images of wealthy white Americans or Europeans frolicking throughout Africa, and it\u2019s typically on a safari tour of some sort. In each episode of Young, Famous & African, this glamorous group is holding court at some spectacular venues. There\u2019s an all-white poetry party on a rooftop with a violinist and beautiful garden filled with lush floral arrangements. You\u2019ll also spot them over-indulging each other at a golf course, poolside or rooftop at top-tier hotels, mansions, private planes, and a host of upscale eateries and cocktail lounges.\n4. There\u2019s a spectacular, obnoxiously glamorous train and safari trip with several wardrobe changes.\nThings come to a head and go a little off the rails in the sixth episode, \u201cMurder on the Blue Train.\u201d This is my favorite episode! It\u2019s a 48-hour luxury train excursion from Johannesburg to the South African province Mpumalanga. It includes a bottomless mimosa and Champagne indulgence upon arrival, plus pajama dinner party, Gatsby-inspired cocktail party, and tense safari tour (lions and deer and hyenas, oh my!) ending with a moonlight dinner featuring grilled meats. It\u2019s a fun game spotting all the little chic accents throughout this posh adventure, from the red carpet leading to the train to flapper feathers garnishing each cupcake to bathtubs in every suite. There\u2019s lots of drama and in-fighting during this trip, but I was so concentrated on the outstanding scenery that I tried to block out the negative aspects.\n5. People are dressing up and looking good in every scene.\nOne of my pet peeves is when folks go out to fabulous restaurants and dress like slobs. Yes, I said it. Part of going out to nice restaurants is enjoying the atmosphere, the people watching. And the stars of Young, Famous & African dress up like their lives depended on it. Their clothing is exciting! Bold colors, exaggerated shoulder pads, plunging necklines, flowing capes, dramatic crowns, excessive jewelry, 5-inch stilettos, over-sized designer sunglasses, layers of ruffles, as well as whimsical feathers, furs, and hats. As I wrote earlier, it sucks that they didn\u2019t spotlight some of these designers because these are truly original looks. And they don\u2019t just dress up to go to dinner either. When the camera cuts to their individual interviews, their attire is even wilder.\nI cannot wait for season 2!", "comment_count": 1, "like_count": 26, "created_time": 1648490478858, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["African Culture", "Reality TV", "African", "Fashion Trends", "Foodies"]}, {"author": "Audarshia Townsend", "post_id": "caedf7c7cb9a", "user_id": "fc3e06460360", "title": "Why Peacock\u2019s Re-Imagined \u2018Hilary Banks\u2019 Is Winning on \u2018Bel-Air\u2019", "content": "My Pen Is Mighty\nWhy Peacock\u2019s Re-Imagined \u2018Hilary Banks\u2019 Is Winning on \u2018Bel-Air\u2019\nCoco Jones\u2019 rendition goes beyond \u201cBlack Valley Girl\u201d persona, exploring social justice issues while whipping up delicious feasts.\nCoco Jones as Hilary Banks in \u201cBel-Air.\u201d Adam Rose/Courtesy of Peacock\nLike most people, I was quite hesitant when I first heard that Will Smith was rebooting the early 1990s classic sitcom \u201cThe Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.\u201d\nThe show spoke to a generation of Black teens and young adults, myself included, who needed an escape from the harsh realities of growing up in a world that wasn\u2019t enthusiastic about us embracing our authentic selves. At the time, we needed that laugh track.\nWith \u201cBel-Air,\u201d the re-imagined version starring Jabari Banks as Will Smith, there are very few laughs\u200a\u2014\u200aand no laugh track. It\u2019s serious business as to how he escaped the rough streets of West Philadelphia to live with his wealthy relatives in a mansion in the gated community of Bel-Air.\nUpon arrival, he\u2019s warmly welcomed by his cousin Hilary Banks (Coco Jones), the eldest child of Aunt Viv (Cassandra Freeman) and Uncle Phil (Adrian Holmes). I\u2019m obsessed with her storyline. There\u2019s definitely something different about this version of Hilary, who proves immediately that she has strong connections to the Black community.\nNo offense to Karyn Parsons\u2019 version of Hilary Banks in the original series\u2014 because she effortlessly portrayed the quintessential \u201cBlack Valley Girl\u201d \u2014 but Jones\u2019 take is much more nuanced and complicated. And if we want to get real, by making her a dark-skinned young woman, you just know her life struggles are going to be intensely different from the original, fairer-complexioned Hilary.\nThe show\u2019s writers also gave this Hilary Banks marketable skills beyond looking fabulous and shopping. She is a burgeoning culinarian, one, like so many others, who has taken her cooking skills to social media. She\u2019s made herself famous by serving up Black culture.\nHilary is first shown in her element in the pilot episode (\u201cDreams and Nightmares\u201d) when she\u2019s catering her dad\u2019s fundraiser for his run for Los Angeles district attorney. She showcases original gourmet pastries as 3,000 followers watch her Instagram live (she also mentions that she has 75,000 IG followers in total). This is when we find out that she\u2019s living in the family\u2019s spacious pool house, which includes a state-of-the-art kitchen for her to conduct her cooking tutorials. She warns Will, \u201cIn two years, I\u2019m going to be in Forbes, and mom\u2019s gonna be salty as f*ck.\u201d\nShe finds out soon, however, that there will be some roadblocks getting there. In an industry where Black influencers earn 35% less than their white counterparts, Hilary is striving to be the exception.\nIn the second episode (\u201cKeep Ya Head Up\u201d), Hilary has an interview with Haute Cuisine, a fictitious, highly rated food and beverage magazine, that her mother helped set up. She\u2019s hoping to get a job with it as a culinary influencer. As part of the interview process, she is tasked to create some of her signature dishes, which she claims go back three generations in her family. She puts modern spins on collard greens, a fried shrimp po\u2019boy, and coleslaw that wow the editors \u2014 all while looking fierce in a fitted, hot pink-and-black plaid suit.\nThe cringeworthy moments, however, happen when the white female editor tells her\u2014 after devouring everything on her plate \u2014 \u201cI must say, Hilary, we\u2019re quite impressed. I would not think that [dishes] so down-market would be so amazing.\u201d YIKES.\nIt only gets worse from there.\n\u201cIn order for us to move forward,\u201d the editor continues, \u201cwe would want to weigh in on your wardrobe. We prefer more classic, neutral colors. \u2026 and before you post anything, you\u2019d have to submit all your recipes for review.\u201d They proceed to tell her to \u201ctone them down\u201d because they\u2019re \u201ctoo spicy\u201d and that her family is \u201cnot their target audience.\u201d\nSo, they\u2019re requiring her to change who she is to get the job. That\u2019s a \u201cno\u201d from Hilary, which leads to a heated exchange with her mom, who tells her that sometimes you have to compromise to get what you want in life.\nIncensed, Hilary goes live on IG and puts Haute Cuisine on blast for their treatment of her. Then she pulls another viral stunt that catches the eye of one of the top influencer houses in the world. She jumps at the chance to get out of the pool house and move into this house with top content creators, a motley crew ranging from \u201cJackass\u201d-style pranksters to a luxury travel expert. Kylo (Jon Beavers), lead creator in the house, makes $1 million annually as a men\u2019s lifestyle brand specialist. He pressures Hilary into doing something risqu\u00e9 on social media to go viral.\nAs the only Black woman in the influencer house, and the only creator serving up culinary-focused content, she is under immense pressure to do something that\u2019s going to create social media buzz. The last thing she wants to do is get kicked out of the house and move back into her parents\u2019 home. Soooo, she records herself whipping up her signature sweet potato cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e wearing skimpy lingerie.\nWhen Kylo releases the video with soft-porn music, lighting, and angles, dubbing her \u201cThe Thirsty Chef,\u201d Hilary must decide if she\u2019s going to sign with lucrative sponsors who thrive off this sort of content or leave with her dignity intact. She gets into another argument with her mother, who strongly advises her to take down the video. Aunt Viv also poses the question: \u201cDoes this really reflect who you are?\u201d\nThat statement really affects Hilary and is a turning point for the character. It\u2019s also a dilemma that many Black content creators face, particularly women, who are determined to portray their authentic selves.\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a lot more of her struggle being in an industry that doesn\u2019t necessarily cater to her,\u201d Jones tells TheGrio about her version of Hilary in a recent interview. \u201cI think the tension between her and Aunt Viv, I think it\u2019s all very honest and relatable because we\u2019re all humans going through a similar human experience. Maybe it\u2019s not social media, but there\u2019s always, especially as a Black woman, there\u2019s always additional obstacles that you didn\u2019t sign up for.\u201d\nWhile Hilary\u2019s situation may be overdramatized for television, it also amplifies their frustrations.

Linder with Ola Linder and Audarshia Townsend as an infant. Photo courtesy of Audarshia Townsend\nThe first time I ever made collard greens was Thanksgiving 2012, and I was super nervous that I was debuting them on the most significant eating day of the year. But my mom had confidence in me and told me that as long as I followed her recipe, I wouldn\u2019t mess them up.\nI did everything she told me to do: I thoroughly cleaned and cut them, added low-sodium chicken stock and smoked turkey legs, plus a few key seasonings, red pepper, red onion, and garlic. I cooked them for several hours until my house was lit up with that distinct collard greens fragrance I remembered from childhood. Only then did I know I made them right.\nWhen the greens were presented to the family on that Thanksgiving, my mom didn\u2019t tell anyone I made them. Uncle Donald was the first to dig in.\n\u201cWho made these greens?!\u201d He demanded after he had a few bites. My mom and I exchanged glances.\n\u201cI did,\u201d I quietly responded.\n\u201cWho, you?\u201d he incredulously responded.\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nHe curiously looked at me as my mom nervously watched on. \u201cAudarshia, you put your foot in these greens!\u201d he exclaimed.\nNow, in the Black community, when someone tells you that you put your foot in a dish (i.e. gumbo, fried chicken, peach cobbler, greens), then you have exceeded beyond expectations. You\u2019ve done excellent work. It\u2019s even better coming from an elder, particularly one of Uncle Donald\u2019s standing in the community.\nUncle Donald had been around my entire life. As my parents\u2019 dearest friend, he \u2014 as well as his wife Ola \u2014 was upgraded to honorary family status. He was my dad\u2019s roommate at Tennessee State University, and introduced him to my mom during one of his infamous and unauthorized house parties.\nHe moved to Chicago from Nashville before my family, and introduced my parents to all the movers and shakers in the Pan African community. He was a prominent and proud Omega Psi Phi Fraternity man, and stepped in their tradition at every opportunity. He was my brother\u2019s godfather. And his family and ours celebrated Kwanzaas, Christmases, birthdays, graduations, reunions, Thankgivings, and more together.\nUncle Donald was there during the rough times, too. When my parents were going through their divorce, he and Aunt Ola stepped in to help without hesitation.\nOnce I reached adulthood, the support never stopped. He read almost everything I ever wrote, from the beginning of my writing career at the Chicago Defender to an essay I wrote for Esquire. Whenever I appeared on television, according to my mom, he\u2019d excitedly call her to make sure she was watching.\nUncle Donald always loved it when I wrote about Black-owned restaurants \u2014 particularly those in his South Side neighborhood. Over the years, we chatted about some of his long-gone favorites, from Gladys\u2019 Luncheonette in Bronzeville to Calumet Heights\u2019 Soul Queen.\nThe last time I visited Uncle Donald, we talked a lot about family, food, and my latest projects. I told him I was writing about classic Chicago dishes, with one being the mustard fried catfish from BJ\u2019s Market. He said, \u201cWait a minute,\u201d went to his kitchen, and returned with a heaving portion of the restaurant\u2019s signature dish and macaroni and cheese.\n\u201cThey really put their foot in this dish,\u201d he exclaimed as he showed it to us.

It was awkward compared to the \u201cMom\u2019s Day\u201d photo we would snap a few months later. Not that it\u2019s awkward to take pictures with my dad \u2014 we\u2019re all smiles \u2014 but the \u201cDad\u2019s Day\u201d photo, which hung above my fraternity brother\u2019s desk, along with a compilation of date party photos, looked anything but natural.\nEach year, the university invites parents to spend a day with their kids. Most of us eat at one of the iconic Eskimo Joe\u2019s restaurants, tailgate, and then head to a football game. Afterward, it\u2019s off to the bars, or whatever late night event your parent can muster the energy for. Outside fraternity and sorority houses, you\u2019ll find co-eds posing for group photos with dear old mom or dad.\nThe photos with the moms always turn out great. There we are, hugging mom or kissing her face. Everyone\u2019s laughing and appears to be having a great time. If your mom made it out to the bar for a drink, like mine did, you\u2019d introduce her to the girl you were interested in while acting part of the perfect gentlemen. Then you\u2019d meet the mother of said-girl and your moms would screech about what a cute couple the two of you would make.\nCan you find me? I\u2019m hugging my mom (in a green shirt)\nDads were different. Like Saturn versus Earth different.\nThe group photos always seemed cold. There were some hugs happening, but they were those weird side hugs that Christians seem so fond of giving one another \u2014 the \u201ckeep some room for the Holy Spirit\u201d variety. Everyone looks like a stoic philosopher; the smiles seem somewhat forced. When the dads came to the bar, they either became Frank the Tank or scanned the room like the Terminator. Most guys never introduced their dad to the girl they were interested in, either. Unlike my mom, my dad and I grabbed dinner and caught up before he had to leave. He had work the next day.\nI\u2019ve long wondered why the two photos turned out so opposite. Why did we suddenly look like \u201cmama\u2019s boys\u201d when we so often tried to be \u201cthe man?\u201d Why such a lack of intimacy with our fathers (and even our friends) when we seemed to be OK with it from our mothers?\nWhere\u2019d You Learn to Be a \u201cMan\u201d?\nThe memory of the Dad\u2019s Day picture has been nagging me, so I start questioning other men and my friends. At first my question was too complex: Who did you learn emotional intimacy from? Or do you feel you have any intimacy with male friends? Some guys laughed. Other stared and responded with something like, \u201cWTF does that mean?\u201d So I changed my question:\n\u201cDid your dad ever teach you how to be a man?\u201d\nThe responses I\u2019ve received range from learning how to change a tire or the oil in a car, or learning how to tie a tie. This made me think, if this is what qualifies as masculinity, we\u2019re in deep shit. So I dug further.\n\u201cDid your dad ever talk to you about the mistakes he made in life? Was he vulnerable? Did he teach you how to date or romance a woman? How to pick healthy friends? Did he talk about sex, porn, or masturbation?\u201d\nIt\u2019s fascinating that in Judeo-Christian literature there\u2019s an entire book of the Bible dedicated to teaching a son about money, friends, sex, adultery, making wise decisions, marriage, and business \u2014 the book of Proverbs, in case you\u2019re wondering \u2014 but in America, the resounding answer I heard from men was, \u201cNo, my dad didn\u2019t talk about those things.\u201d If a father did talk about those issues, then it was usually one of those, \u201cThis is how sex works\u2026 good talk,\u201d moments. But because we live in what I call a fatherless generation, Dad wasn\u2019t often in the picture to begin with.\nSo where did we learn to become men?\nThe Influence of the Alpha Male\nMost everyone who\u2019s read Lord of the Flies remembers how a group of boys descend into barbarity, and can easily recall the moment where Piggy gets his brains smashed in. For most boys, growing up these days isn\u2019t all that dissimilar. With no one teaching young men virtue, character, or responsibility, the alpha male emerges thinking he has some semblance of how the world works, and so the other boys follow his lead. Sometimes the alpha male lands that leadership position because he\u2019s mimicking problematic behavior that\u2019s been demonstrated by a shitty father figure at home, which his friends may consider cool, since they don\u2019t have positive male representation around them. Dad shows him porn, so he shows it to his friends, who then learn early on to objectify women. Dad talks about sports all the time and can tell you where every player on the Patriots played junior varsity football, so his alpha son gets his friends into sports and berates them for not having an encyclopedic knowledge. Dad talks about women with misogynistic overtones, so he and his friends mimic him and begin to talk that way too. Dad reminds his son that real men don\u2019t cry. Real men act tough all the time. Real men get angry when insulted. Real men don\u2019t show their emotions.\nPhotos like this are great, but sadly, most men would wonder if they\u2019re gay instead just of friends | Photo by Derek Owens on Unsplash\nIt doesn\u2019t all come down to just one alpha\u2019s influence, though. Many of these behaviors and ideas permeate young boys\u2019 minds through things they\u2019ve seen or heard in the media and online. The wolves teach the wolf pups how to become wolves. But we don\u2019t run in packs anymore. We prefer to lone wolf it. Or if we do run in a pack, we never display weakness for fear we\u2019ll be turned on and devoured.\nIt\u2019s a lonely world when you don\u2019t have friends you can have deep conversations with. It\u2019s much more common to find yourself in male friendships where you can\u2019t express your angst or pain without fear of being labeled a pussy. There\u2019s no camaraderie. Aside from guys you grab drinks with after work or go to a sporting event with, the extent of your relationship is superficial. When you don\u2019t know how to manage your emotions, you won\u2019t know how to handle rejection, dating, fear, loneliness, or sadness \u2014 let alone anything else. Virtues like character, loyalty, love, humility, courage, and vulnerability are replaced with vices like anger, jealousy, vanity, and pride.\nWhile men desperately crave emotional intimacy with other men, some of us have built up callouses so tough that even the notion of deep connection is considered effeminate. Instead, men lash out with deadly violence and dive head first into asynchronistic digital intimacy as opposed to real relationships.\nGetting Bombed in Austin and the Porn Patch\nEvery man can tell how many goats or sheep he possesses, but not how many friends.\n\u2014 Marcus Tullius Cicero\nWhen the package bombings that rocked Austin, Texas, made the news this past March, friends called to check and see if I was anywhere near the explosions. Once they learned I was fine, they asked if the bombings carried the markings of someone with military expertise, due to my combat experience.\nAll around Austin, fear ran rampant as rumors were passed as fact. Neighbors informed me that our area of town should expect to be hit next. I laughed at their misinformed panic, fueled by the fact that we love to believe what we want to hear \u2014 provided it lines up with what we already assume.\nWhen I explained that the Austin bombings carried the mark of an amateur who probably learned from YouTube, the dark web, or a jihadi website, people then asked about motive. While everyone still seems to be searching for it \u2014 since bomber Mark Anthony Conditt\u2019s confession video didn\u2019t offer any definitive explanation \u2014 I think it\u2019s right in front of our faces. The statement made about Conditt\u2019s confession video by Austin police Chief \u00adBrian Manley explained that this was \u201cthe outcry of a very challenged young man talking about challenges in his personal life that led him to this point.\u201d\nPeople were caught up in semantics after Manley\u2019s statement, wanting to know whether the bomber was a terrorist or whether his motive was racially-based, since two of the victims were prominent members of Austin\u2019s black community. I think the more simple truth is \u2014 like other men in our generation \u2014 Conditt was lonely, isolated, and bought into the view that men express anger and hurt through violence. As I stated in another piece, we\u2019re dealing with a generation that no longer has the skills necessary to cope with hardship and adversity. People are chronically lonely even though they\u2019re more connected than ever. Notice there are zero media reports in which they interview Conditt\u2019s friends or past girlfriends, even. The only people in the interviews are old acquaintances from school or church. And don\u2019t hold up the penalty card as if his dad provided sufficient care because he was raised in a religious home. Many times, religious homes can be the most emotionally vacant place for a young man.\nAustin bomber Mark Anthony Conditt\nOne thing I feel would confirm my suspicions about the Austin bomber is whether he regularly consumed porn. Hear me out: Since we have no reports on friends or past girlfriends, one thing most lonely men do is watch porn. Just get on 4Chan or a similar site and the chatter often revolves around porn while simultaneously making fun of themselves for living in their parents\u2019 basements. It\u2019s an easy patch for the lack of emotional intimacy they crave with a real human.\nCan\u2019t get a date? There\u2019s porn for that.\nDon\u2019t know how to talk to a woman? There\u2019s porn for that.\nGet rejected when you ask a girl out? There\u2019s porn for that.\nIn my line of work, I counsel a lot of young men through porn addiction. They always come in thinking porn is the issue, but it\u2019s always symptomatic of something much deeper. Out of each man I\u2019ve counseled, I\u2019ve discovered that they all lacked emotional intimacy with their dad growing up. While that may sound ludicrous, consider this excerpt from Dr. Joshua Straub\u2019s book Safe House.\nA team of researchers at the John Hopkins School of Medicine set out on a 30-year study to find if a single related cause existed for five major issues: mental illness, hypertension, malignant tumors, coronary heart disease, and suicide. After studying 1,377 students over thirty years, the most prevalent single cause wasn\u2019t what everyone thought. They found that the most significant predictor of these tragedies was a lack of closeness to the parents, especially the father.\nThe Warrior Poet\nLate one evening I stumbled out of a dusty building like a drunk pirate not quite used to walking on land. My head was spinning from the news I had just received. I wanted to vomit and scream all at the same time. The Iraqi base I was stationed at in the middle of Ramadi remained still while the whirl of generators filled the night, my shuffling adding to the noise. Taking another step, I collapsed into the dirt and wept until my tears formed mud on my hands and face.\nIt would be my friend Greg who would find the shell of a man lying on the ground with a muddy, tear-streaked face.\n\u201cShe\u2019s leaving. She\u2019s leaving\u2026 god, she\u2019s really leaving,\u201d is all I managed to get out while sobs racked my body.\nThirty minutes ago I\u2019d gotten the devastating news about the end of my relationship back home. Iraq was a hard enough place to deal with anyway, but now the person I loved most was gone. Greg leaned me against his barrel-shaped chest and hugged me while I cried. What he said that night made all the difference.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not alone\u2026 and we\u2019ll get through this together.\u201d\nMany view the military as the epitome or last great bastion of masculinity. Even English writer Samuel Johnson once remarked, \u201cEvery man thinks meanly of himself for not having been a soldier, or not having been at sea.\u201d Each time men learn I served in the military and in combat, I often hear similar sentiments. \u201cI wanted to enlist, but have a medical condition/parents wanted me to go to college/[insert reason here].\u201d While many men (but not all) see the military as a mark of masculinity, what they fail to recognize or acknowledge is the deep and emotional bonding that occurs amongst soldiers. Instead they paint us solely as warriors and never poets with deep feelings.\nOf the men I served with I can tell you about their life stories, fears, victories, relationships, and struggles. We\u2019ve cried, hugged, laughed, and shared some of our deepest secrets with one another.\nMen at war | Photo from Wikipedia\nWhile post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) gets lobbed around like a grenade in a china store as an explanation for why soldiers are killing themselves at an endemic rate, I believe the answer is much simpler. We\u2019re lonely and lack the emotional intimacy we once had with our brothers in arms.\nThose who ascribe to the toxic view that men should stifle their emotions are likely unaware of a soldier\u2019s capacity to feel deeply \u2014 due in large part to the relationships we foster \u2014 and their possession of a so-called \u201ceffeminate\u201d side.\nOh Fathers, Where Art Thou?\n\u201dThe price good men pay for indifference to public affairs is to be ruled by evil men.\u201d\n\u2014 Plato, \u201cThe Republic\u201d\nAs a child, I jumped off houses trying to mimic Superman. I microwaved spiders in an attempt to transform into Spiderman. Every stick was a sword. Apples became grenades. Crackers were carefully bitten into the shape of guns as my brother and I carried out invisible cracker wars with our snacks.\nBut I also drew and loved art. I sang in a choir. I played with Barbies. I wrote poetry and stories.\nThere is currently a two pronged assault on young boys.\nWe view roughhousing, playing with toy swords, and fake war as a sign that our boys will become psychopaths because of recent events.\nMen falsely believe sensitivity and visible displays of emotions are signs of weakness.\nThis leaves a lot of young men growing up confused. We don\u2019t engage in the healthy types of play we need to bond, and we don\u2019t get the emotional connection we need from fathers or other men. This leaves men apathetic and indifferent when they feel they can be neither, and thus we retreat into our digital worlds of lethargy.\nToday, many good men sit on the sidelines while evil continues to infect the masculine soul like a cancer. We\u2019re not teaching young men virtue or character, but vice. We\u2019re telling them, tamp down your feelings, but also don\u2019t be too masculine because that\u2019s bad. The internal warrior gets crushed, and the poet is labeled a sissy.\nI\u2019m not sure what the answer is to all this, but I know it begins with strong male figures \u201cfathering\u201d other men. It will take men of integrity who want to change our culture from within, not those who scream from their social media soapbox. Any change that happens will be built on the backs of one-on-one mentoring between men of character and their pupils lost and adrift in today\u2019s culture.\nIt will take men of honor.\nIt will take courage in a world that promotes vice.\nOnly then can we create warrior poets.", "comment_count": 214, "like_count": 84798, "created_time": 1522726332041, "comment": [{"user_id": "25cd1cc62d2c", "comment_time": 1522726332041, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "846d5c756dae", "comment_time": 1522984140792, "comment": "I don\u2019t agree with AJ Butler\u2019s point about feminism.

I\u2019d been walking past a helicopter landing zone, when I saw the woman gathered around a large crowd of soldiers.\nMen who haven\u2019t seen a woman in months either act like a neanderthal or a cat who\u2019s killed a mouse and left the carcass on the front porch as a gift. Now that I\u2019d been in Afghanistan for close to six months without having seen a single female, I lost my bearing and openly gaped. Other men gaggled and strained to see the woman, peeking around large barriers or acting like they had business at the flight pad. I hiked up the towel I was wearing around my waist, then started into a dead sprint.\n\u201cGonzo! Gonzo!\u201d I yelled, bursting into our room after seeing the woman on the landing zone. \u201cThere\u2019s some super-hot chick that arrived wearing body armor who is being escorted around everywhere. We didn\u2019t actually pull off some version of the Beyonc\u00e9 prank, did we?\u201d\n\u201cThe Beyonc\u00e9 prank\u201d almost landed us in serious trouble. In the military, and especially war, rumors become fact because there\u2019s nothing to do when you\u2019re bored and away from home but speculate. We call this misinformation Rumor Intelligence, or RUMINT, and it\u2019s a standard response when challenging an absurd statement (you\u2019d say, \u201cThat sounds like RUMINT.\u201d).\nGonzo was my senior team sergeant and he and I both worked within the same command as psychological operations soldiers. Because of this, there was often a lot of crossover. A month earlier, we had wagered we could start a psychological operations (psyop) campaign and make it spread. Part of this was out of genuine curiosity to see how fast a rumor could spread, but we never intended for it to get out of hand the way it did.\nOur propaganda campaign started while sitting at dinner with John Bissell, an Air Force Tactical Air Control Party, who was in on the ruse. Gonzo spoke in a secretive tone, but raised his volume enough to ensure nearby tables could overhear.\n\u201cMan, that\u2019s bullshit that my pass is scheduled the same time Beyonc\u00e9 is coming here.\u201d\nThat was it. That was the statement we injected into the populace, and it spread like wildfire.\nBefore long, there was an actual date and time for the Beyonc\u00e9 visit. Soldiers began canceling their leave to go home to the States to ensure they caught the performance. The rumor fueled such outlandish claims that the colonel of the small forward operating base had to have an emergency staff meeting.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know who started this bullshit rumor, but I will thrash whoever it is! For God\u2019s sake! We have men canceling leave!\u201d\nThe colonel paced angrily at the front of the room while Gonzo and I sat like statues, certain that if we even moved wrong, we\u2019d give away our culpability. The Command Sergeant Major chimed in to address the sergeants in the room. \u201cYou really think the USO is going to drag Beyonc\u00e9 to a small-ass base that gets hit almost every other day?\u201d\nA young solider found the courage to give his input from the back. \u201cBut Sergeant Major, didn\u2019t Bob Hope visit troops on the front?\u201d\n\u201cWho told you that? I bet your lieutenant told you that, didn\u2019t he?\u201d The room erupted in laughter. \u201cWhen did you ever see Bob Hope at the Battle of the Bulge, private?\u201d\nWhen the emergency briefing to squash the Beyonc\u00e9 rumors ended, Gonzo and I excused ourselves. Only when we got to our room did we double over and laugh till we couldn\u2019t breathe. However, it now appeared that perhaps our rumor had fueled a special guest appearance. Had I just psyop\u2019ed myself?\n\u201cThey\u2019re embedded reporters from 60 Minutes II,\u201d Gonzo said coolly. \u201cColonel gave the staff a heads-up the other day and reminded us all to be on our best behavior. Any hijinks end up in the news, and it\u2019ll be everyone\u2019s ass. So try not to do anything dumb, okay?\u201d\n\u201cLike hit on her?\u201d\n\u201cExactly like that, dumbass.\u201d\nWithin a day we met the mystery woman and the man accompanying her: Lara Logan, the chief foreign correspondent for 60 Minutes, and her cameraman, Jeff Newton.\nLara and Jeff began accompanying us on patrols as we spent most of our time outside the wire and speaking to the locals. As the Iraq war had kicked off, the U.S. Eye of Sauron had shifted its gaze to the Middle East. Afghanistan, in the minds of the populace, was an overwhelming victory and easily forgotten. The team at 60 Minutes, however, had heard of the ongoing violence on the border and strained tensions between the U.S. and Pakistan. Sensing a story that could prove interesting, they headed to the border.\nSoon, Lara, Jeff, Bissell, Gonzo and I were spending our evenings in Bissell\u2019s tent developing a friendship. We\u2019d been skeptical of the news team, but when they hit a landmine that took off the leg of one sergeant we worked with, they earned our respect and trust. Lara came back pretty battered and with a swollen cheek, while Jeff had some of his equipment destroyed.\nAfter the incident, a newfound gratitude for life emerged in the two reporters. They grasped the struggles we faced daily in combat. Whether it was getting hit with rockets, running over landmines, or getting shot at, we found joy in our tight-knit brotherhood. It is this bond of combat that brings soldiers together, and when others experience it, there\u2019s a mutual understanding: you\u2019re one of us now.\nAuthor with 60 Minutes News Correspondent, Lara Logan\nWe never spoke about combat unless they interviewed us on camera. Instead, we told stories of home, our families, or mercilessly teased one another when with Lara and Jeff.\n\u201cHey, Bissell! Tell Lara about how you solicited sex from a cat!\u201d I yelled across the makeshift table we set up in his tent one evening. Bissell had just taken a jab at me, and my insecurity and bravado wouldn\u2019t let it slide.\nBissell\u2019s face became sober. \u201cDude. Seriously?\u201d\nGonzo giggled like a schoolgirl, trying to stifle his amusement with a hand over his mouth.\n\u201cSex. From a cat?\u201d Lara asked in her thick South African accent. \u201cLike an actual cat?\u201d\nRubbing my hands together vigorously, I recounted the tale with grandiose gesticulation.\nWhile we\u2019d killed all the dogs on base, various cats ran free to help control the mice. Bissell had adopted a small black cat that showed up in his tent one afternoon, whining for food. The poor thing was malnourished, so he began feeding the cat food from the chow hall and nursing it back to health.\nWith time, the cat took a liking to Bissell and began sleeping on the foot of his cot. When it got cold, the cat would climb into his sleep sack. While sleeping one night \u2014 wearing only his boxers \u2014 Bissell\u2019s penis fell out of the portion designed for quick access. The cat, thinking it was a toy or perhaps a mouse, attacked and bit it. Bissell awoke with a scream and hurled the cat out of the tent. When he told us the story the next morning, we were laughing so hard, I had to lie down. Bissell, however, insisted it wasn\u2019t that funny.\nThe story put Lara and Jeff into a fit of laughter while Bissell glared at me. While we both had girlfriends back home, I think at some subconscious level Bissell and I were trying to show off in order to garner Lara\u2019s affection. We spent most of our evenings with Lara and Jeff throughout the month of November, running missions and having them accompany us on patrols.\nThen one day, their time was up. With the story captured, their stint with a bunch of soldiers on the border came to an end. We remained to fight a war and life continued as it had \u2014 rocket attacks, dysentery, boredom, patrols, and firefights. Wash. Rinse. Repeat.\nI suppose that\u2019s one way war movies can be misleading. When you don\u2019t know any better, you assume that war is one giant firefight. No one prepares you for the intense boredom. You\u2019ll tell the same stories eighty thousand times to the same soldiers. You\u2019ll watch an entire nine seasons of Friends. Some days, you\u2019ll write letters home. Or masturbate. Maybe you\u2019ll spend time in the Porta Potty just to be alone for a change. And you read. Sweet Lord, do you read.\nBut it\u2019s always the small moments of peace that war interrupts.\nShortly after Laura and Jeff\u2019s departure, the small window in my room exploded in a shower of glass. The wood panel I kept in front of the glass landed at my feet with glass shards peppering the floor. I stared at the shattered wood and glass for a few moments until the sirens went off. I scrambled and put on my body armor, thinking briefly that in the cold December shrill, I might want to put on warmer clothes other than my stained brown shirt and black shorts. Unwilling to take that gamble, I charged into the open air, where I found a medic frantically working on a young Afghan boy with shrapnel in his chest, gasping for air.\nI hovered over both the boy and the medic, uncertain if I should help. The medic flicked a large-bore needle, preparing to jam the syringe into the kid\u2019s chest. I waited a moment longer, watching the blood pool into the silt below the child\u2019s back, then found my feet and ran.\nLittle did I know, that day would change everything.\nThis is an adapted excerpt from my upcoming war memoir, Where Cowards Go to Die.

But the truth is a little more nuanced.\nImage practically posted everywhere online, meme generator sites, and on social media\nWhen I was a middle school student, I came to class sporting fresh stitches above my right eyebrow. A day earlier, I got sucker punched by a neighbor when I went over to his house to play basketball. He\u2019d gotten involved in the wrong crowd and local gangs, and heard a rumor that I\u2019d made fun of some girl I didn\u2019t even know. He tossed me the basketball then haymakered my face.\nConfused, I stumbled backward, touched my face, and laughed. \u201cWhat was that for?\u201d I asked.\nA few years earlier, I\u2019d gotten involved in martial arts because I\u2019d been picked on relentlessly in my tweens, so I could take a punch. But when the crimson streak on my hand and warm gushing sensation on my face registered, I ran off crying. My parents would take me to get stitches, and the following day I wandered the halls, head down and ashamed as word spread throughout my school.\nThat event forced me to become much more serious in training, and by my senior year in high school, I was competing in bare-fisted, full contact tournaments. Once I turned 18, I joined the military. I learned how to use rifles, pistols, knives, and explosives to render a man nothing more than tiny bits of viscera and flesh. In college, I studied Brazilian Ju Jitsu after losing a match to a roommate whose father was an All American wrestler. Then I went to war. Not once, but twice. Around me, I saw violence as an ever looming option. The question I always wrestled with was \u201cwhen?\u201d When should I step into the fray and enact violence?\nWhich brings us to Will Smith.\nFor the unaware \u2014 though it\u2019s been plastered everywhere online in recent days \u2014 actor Will Smith slapped comedian Chris Rock during the Oscars. Rock made a joke, a staple during the awards ceremony, about Smith\u2019s wife looking like she was auditioning for GI Jane 2. Smith\u2019s wife has a hair loss condition known as alopecia, and he took it as a personal offense, leaving his seat, marching on stage, and slapping the comedian.\nPeople were uncertain whether it was staged until the camera cut to commercial. The aftermath flooded the internet with memes and hot takes. One publication even compiled an entire list of \u201cWill Smith Slap Takes\u201d ranging from violence never being okay, toxic masculinity, elites not suffering consequences, racism, Donald Trump (seriously), Ukraine, and setting back black culture.\nI, personally, have no intention of providing another half-baked analysis of the \u201cslap heard round the world\u201d to a chum filled sea surrounded by circling sharks. However, my life carries an unfortunate history of violence, and violence \u2014 whether or not we\u2019d like to admit it \u2014 is part of the human condition. Regardless of what you think of Smith\u2019s actions (and they were violent), there\u2019s a deeper, nuanced conversation we\u2019re skimming over that is at the base of the conversation ongoing in the public forum.\nThat conversation subconsciously dances around the fact that violence is always an option.\n\u201cIt is one thing to study war and another to live the warrior\u2019s life.\u201d\n\u2014 Steven Pressfield\nOne Saturday morning in my late 20s, I awoke under a green, brown, and white striped duvet cover in my apartment while the sun glinted through my window. Laying there in the solace and quiet, a profound realization spread like an unknowing cancer. I was almost 30 and all I\u2019d known was violence for most of my life. This epiphany shook me to the core, and for several years after, I didn\u2019t touch firearms, knives, or train in martial arts. Instead, I observed the world and got busy experiencing food, the outdoors, recreation, and friendships.\nBut no matter where I went, violence followed me. Always looming, reminding me, and pressing on the simple reality that when push came to shove, violence was an option. I would observe bar fights and wonder whether to step in. A young man calling a woman a \u201cwhore\u201d because she\u2019d rebuffed his advance only to have him intimidate her. A guy at the gym who stole money and played it off, intimidating the other men because of his size. I let them slide. Not my fight anymore, I rationalized.\nAs children, we learn that violence is never okay. And yet, children \u2014 by nature \u2014 are violent. Anyone who says differently has never been a parent. Ask any mom or dad about a time their infant hit, struck, bit, or raised an appendage in defiance when they didn\u2019t get what they want. My own children have never seen me lift as much as a finger toward their mother, yet have scratched, bit, or hit me as early as a crawling stage. If we are brutally honest, every adult entertains violent thoughts. We\u2019ve just learned how to control them. But given the right scenario, like Will Smith, violent emotion and passion may erupt and spill to the surface.\nIt reminds me of a phrase repeated throughout the HBO miniseries, WestWorld: \u201cThese violent delights have violent ends.\u201d The phrase originates from Shakespeare\u2019s Romeo and Juliet. In the tragedy, Romeo gushes to Friar Lawerence about Juliet\u2019s beauty. Lawrence then cautions Romeo that his violent (i.e. rash) passions may result in an equally violent end. We all know how the play ends and Lawrence\u2019s words become a prophetic foreshadowing.\nThe world is a violent place. Nature is especially violent. However, we seem to have this inclination to romanticize it, never once stopping to watch a lion shred a zebra or an insect suck the guts out of a frog it\u2019s paralyzed. The mountain lion doesn\u2019t care that you\u2019re just hiking and have young children. The cliff is indifferent to whether you fall off and break every bone on the way down. Does the Ukrainian think about the Russian soldier having a wife, family, and kids back home as he pulls the trigger in rapid succession? Probably not. He\u2019s trying to survive, just like prey fighting back against predator in the wild.\nThat\u2019s the part we can\u2019t agree on as a society: when is violence acceptable? When fighting human traffickers? Someone stealing your child? Russian soldiers invading your homeland? Taking out Nazis running concentration camps?\nWhile pacifism has its merits, will it stop a cartel member from skinning your family alive? Or is it the undercover police officer who ends up in a firefight that puts an end to their violent delights?\nAuthor Eric Weiner recounts a moment in a recent OneZero piece in which a woman fleeing Ukraine stands stupefied. She tells a CNN reporter that she can\u2019t believe an invasion could happen in 2022. \u201cWe have Teslas and so much amazing technology,\u201d she states.\nWeiner\u2019s article is reminiscent of multiple conversations I\u2019ve had with men and women who adhere to a misplaced notion that technology and the Enlightenment have accomplished greater human flourishing. Each generation likes to snub their nose at the previous for being barbaric while they ignore the glaring realities in front of them.\nTechnology, for all it\u2019s good, has created some of the world\u2019s greatest human suffering. Drone strikes can kill people groups en masse. We have atomic bombs that can destroy the entire world, whereas the Vikings couldn\u2019t accomplish that. Tesla isn\u2019t coming to save you, but a car thief might just use your electric vehicle to run over some innocent bystanders while eluding the police. While we may not condone violence, it is an option, and it\u2019s never been easier to commit genocide, given the rate of our technological sprawl.\nThe fall of Kabul and subsequent withdrawal from Afghanistan emphasized our savage reality and inability to process violence as an option. In George Packer\u2019s piece in The Atlantic, he interviews a young Afghan woman who\u2019d grown up in Kabul under the watchful eye of American soldiers. He recalls:\n\u2026she was sure that Kabul, where she had grown up under American protection, was too big and modern to fall to the Taliban. \u201cKabul is a city full of younger generations,\u201d she said, \u201cfull of girls and boys who can talk, who can fight with their writing, with their speaking.\u201d\nAfghanistan has become the world\u2019s largest humanitarian crisis as the country teeters on the edge of famine under the violent return of the Taliban. Their return is a catastrophic human rights violation for women. While I believe in the power of the pen being a writer myself, when the wolves are at the gate, fighting with an essay while they devour your family does little good.\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s one thing to wax philosophical in the online forum about violence while signaling deeply held virtues, but quite another when facing a mugger, bully, soldier, the Taliban, terrorist, or domestic abuse. Every person claims to know what they\u2019d do\u2014myself included\u2014but when push comes to shove, perhaps it\u2019s better to dwell on Shakespeare\u2019s words:\n\u201cThese violent delights have violent ends.\u201d\nPre-orders are now available for my upcoming war memoir, Where Cowards Go to Die, or you can get free writing advice by joining my newsletter.", "comment_count": 54, "like_count": 2577, "created_time": 1648762374978, "comment": [{"user_id": "25cd1cc62d2c", "comment_time": 1648762374978, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "73e36db6468a", "comment_time": 1648807723504, "comment": "If violence is an option without consequences, every street will bathe in blood."}, {"user_id": "7a2cc46331bc", "comment_time": 1648776750789, "comment": "Interesting article and many of your conclusions ring true.

It\u2019s kind of like people who have revolving credit cards where they keep a consistent balance, but then move it to a new card before the higher interest occurs. But given enough time, the ruse always ends in disaster, and brings us to events unfolding inside Russia and Ukraine.\nIn a previous analysis, I explained Russia\u2019s \u201creasons\u201d for invading Ukraine and the geopolitical ramifications for Europe and the West (If you haven\u2019t, I recommend reading that first). However, as multiple Ukrainian cities continue to be razed by Russian forces, many have wondered what to expect. How does it affect the world? The United States? Given that oil prices appear to be at the forefront of everyone\u2019s mind in America, let me start by ripping the band-aid off \u2014 we\u2019re screwed.\nConsider the following: we\u2019ve currently sanctioned \u2014 or have strained relationships with \u2014 Iran, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, and now, Russia. Each country is a major world oil exporter. Given the war in Ukraine, we\u2019re about to watch 5 million barrels of Russian crude go offline, with gas prices in the United States already hovering around $4.00 per gallon. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have rejected the Biden Administration\u2019s calls to ease surging oil prices despite boasting spare capacity. So either the Biden Administration makes some deals with the devil, or we choose the nuclear option: we shut off oil exports to the rest of the world in order to stabilize American gas prices.\nIn the 2015 Omnibus bill that President Obama signed into law, foreign markets got access to producers and traders of U.S. crude oil for the first time in 40 years. This increased profits for the oil and gas industry, but here\u2019s the catch \u2014 any U.S. President can cancel all crude exports overnight if they so desired. If Biden felt enough pressure, they could stop the export of oil and gas, which would drop us back down to $70/barrel. The rest of the world, though? Losing American and Russian oil could easily drive oil prices to $200/barrel. While we\u2019d be self sufficient given our own shale revolution and production capacities, the rest of the world would suffer.\nThere\u2019s just one problem. Even if we cut off our crude oil exports and increased production, according to friends in oil and gas, the earliest we\u2019d be looking at any type of price relief would be 9 months to a year later to produce the level of barrels per day we\u2019d need to combat inflation. This is where that adage, \u201crobbing Peter to pay Paul,\u201d comes to mind. We can screw over the rest of the world to meet our needs, or we make some deals with less than favorable players in South America and the Middle East. But either way, we\u2019re not looking at any type of relief until 2023, and given that everyone wants to travel post-COVID this summer, don\u2019t expect prices to drop. In fact, I would expect them to go up if House Democrats don\u2019t abandon their clean energy initiatives, especially since progressives want to ban drilling on federal lands.\nBut liberal progressive are in for another shock, because clean energy is about to get real pricey.\nTech and the clean energy dilemma\nThe state of Colorado began pushing green initiatives years ago and is in the process of shutting down several coal plants. Because of these initiatives and energy inflation, when my January utility bill arrived, my jaw about hit the floor as it was double the normal rate. Most people across the United States also had record high costs due to inflation, and rising energy costs caused me to look more seriously into renewable energy. While I\u2019d been exploring solar panels for some time, the war in Ukraine pushed me over the edge, and I signed a contract to lock in the cost and a loan rate.\nThe reason I did this?\nRussia is the largest exporter of natural gas, the second largest exporter of crude oil, and third largest exporter of coal. With these factors in mind, it\u2019s easy to see that we\u2019re about to watch our energy bills become an absolute dumpster fire. Of course, the rallying cry then becomes \u201cGREEN ENERGY!\u201d and all the AOC pundits rejoice.\nNot so fast.\nI reached out to former co-workers running their own geopolitical analysis firms to confirm some facts. First on the docket was Peter Zeihan, who runs Zeihan on Geopolitics and is an author of multiple geopolitical forecasting books (full disclosure: I do contract work for his company). Peter correctly predicted the invasion of Ukraine back in 2017, and has been educating major companies and the public on what to expect. As for our green new future? It isn\u2019t looking too bright. Below is a chart from his company that shows the minerals and commodities used in green tech.\nSource: Zeihan on Geopolitics\nRussia is the world\u2019s third largest exporter of aluminum, and they also get their bauxite and aluminum oxide \u2014 which we use in artificial intelligence tech \u2014 from Ukraine (which, as a reminder, the Russians are bombing to the ground). After the initial invasion, the London Metals Exchange halted nickel trading after it tripled. Nickel, as you can see from the chart, is also used in green tech. While we may want to move to a more green environment, this is once more an example of robbing Peter to pay Paul. Instead of using oil, gas, and coal \u2014 which have been stable supply lines for decades \u2014 we\u2019re talking about using thirteen new supply chain commodities to build green tech in which there\u2019s about to be a shortage.\nYou\u2019re probably wondering why I bought solar panels then, given these facts? Simple. Energy prices are about to go gangbusters and I need a renewable solution that doesn\u2019t bankrupt me. By locking in a contract now, let alone in a state where there\u2019s 300 days of sunshine on average, I don\u2019t have to worry about the green tech nightmare that\u2019s about to emerge. Instead, I have a locked in price when items like solar and electric cars are likely to double. Hell, used cars have doubled in price simply due to chip shortages for newer cars. And that brings up a looming problem another former co-worker pointed out.\nI reached out to Marko Papic, the Chief Strategist at Clocktower Group and author of Geopolitical Alpha: An Investment Framework for Predicting the Future. I wanted his input on the looming issues regarding the Russia-Ukraine War, but when I asked about tech and green energy, he texted me the following:\n\u201cRussia can absolutely f*** us. Particularly because of neon\u2026 which is important for chip production. They could create further supply chain issues that add to the general inflationary environment. It\u2019s a shit show and we may need to have a recession next year.\u201d\nThink about how many items we rely on now that involve chip production \u2014 cars, TVs, smart phones, computers, etc\u2014and these new shortages from the war have already hit places like Ford. Marko also pointed me to an interview he did with Bloomberg to clarify his recession point, stating that every time we\u2019ve had a recession, a surge in crude-oil prices has historically driven a recession. Many people forget that in 2008, gasoline prices hit close to $4.50 per gallon, which also is when we had the subprime lending crisis that led to the Great Recession.\nJust to fact check both analysts, I also reached out to a former Russian analyst I\u2019ll call Liz, who now works in global security for a major company in Silicon Valley.\n\u201cThe whole invasion gave me flashbacks to the 2008 invasion of Georgia, only this time Putin screwed himself,\u201d Liz told me. \u201cWithout that social contract of stability with the Russian people and oligarchs, I\u2019m guessing he has a sudden heart attack. The problem is he already created an energy vacuum, and it\u2019s not going to get any better. If you need electronics, get them now, because by Christmas it\u2019ll be slim pickings.\u201d\nGiven the looming energy crisis, unsustainable renewable energy, and tech supply chain issues, it begs the question: how will the Biden administration respond?\nNot everything is Russia\u2019s fault\nThe greatest inflation scapegoat the Biden administration currently has is Russia. If inflation climbs higher, or things go wrong in the economy, they can merely blame Russia. However, reality is a lot more nuanced. Sure, the invasion of Ukraine and everything from gas to wheat to nickel is affecting the world\u2019s inflation rates. But also remember that because of the COVID-19 pandemic and job instability, the Federal Reserve printed money and gave most Americans stimulus checks (I won\u2019t lie. I never foresaw this ending well, but I\u2019ll never turn down free money). Interest rates, however, have hovered around all-time lows despite us printing money out of thin air. An economy cannot recoup those losses without raising interest rates, and just yesterday Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said \u201cthe central bank is prepared to raise interest rates by a half percentage-point at its next meeting\u201d to combat inflation.\nI bought my first home while serving in Iraq right before the Subprime Lending Crisis. At the time, I thought I got a steal at 6% APR because I had a VA loan. These days, however, veterans can get as low as 2.75% and standard mortgage rates hover around 4%. But imagine a return to 6% interest rates on an already hot housing market? Disaster. It would price most Americans completely out of the housing market.\nThen there\u2019s your average American pissed off about inflation and gas prices. No matter a previous administration\u2019s culpability, We the People will always blame the current administration. If times are good, we\u2019re appeased, but god help whoever is in the White House if things are bad, and currently that\u2019s Biden.\nGiven that we\u2019re headed for a summer of energy inflation with most people wanting to get out from under the shadow of COVID, my guess is the Biden administration is going to flip like fish in order to win mid-terms or get hit by a red wave at the polls. During the last State of the Union, Biden stated defunding the police was not the answer, but that funding police paved the way for safer communities. His Vice President, Kamala Harris, heartily agreed, despite having spoken out about reimagining police reform to be community oriented during the 2020 protests. They flipped (or softened) their stance because many in the U.S. became worried about crime and safety. Given that Americans are already reeling from years of COVID, inflation, working from home without care for their kids, income inequality, distrust of the government, and a slew of other compounding issues, I think you\u2019re about to watch the Biden Administration do an about face and appease the public to garner favor before the midterms.\nSo what does that mean? It means the Green New Deal is out. It means a world that once knew Team America: World Police interfering in just about everything is about to grow much more insular to focus on issues at home.\nBut first, we have to make it through a red, hot energy inflation summer.", "comment_count": 11, "like_count": 957, "created_time": 1647983204243, "comment": [{"user_id": "25cd1cc62d2c", "comment_time": 1647983204243, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "9e86d077b1e2", "comment_time": 1648066050760, "comment": "As a friend used to say, \u201cbut other than that, Mrs Lincoln, how was the play?\u201d\nYeah, it\u2019s not looking rosy for the next year or so, but sadly, we\u2019re better off than Ukraine \ud83d\ude22"}, {"user_id": "274a33b23916", "comment_time": 1648137112864, "comment": "Ben....time for a new pic with a nice shirt"}, {"user_id": "d30498f21a97", "comment_time": 1648308236870, "comment": "I may have disagreed with you on some other posts, but this is damn good, Ben.

Oil on canvas. Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna. Image source Wikimedia Commons\nThe first thing to note about Vermeer\u2019s remarkable image, The Art of Painting, is the tapestry that hangs along the left side of the painting. Notice how it has been drawn aside like a drape, and is also held back by a chair pushed up against it.\nThe effect of the drape is to reveal the scene in front of us, almost like a stage-set as the curtain is being lifted. The word for this technique is repoussoir: an object in a painting positioned in the foreground and to one side, serving to direct the viewer\u2019s attention toward the main subject of the work.\nIn this painting, Vermeer\u2019s use of the drape is emphatic: it successfully pulls us into the space beyond it, emphasising the depth of the room and encouraging us to feel as if we are peering in.\nAnd since the brightest area of the painting \u2014 the thin triangle of white wall at the back of the room \u2014 sits directly behind the curtain, Vermeer has managed to accentuate the depth of the space and gently lead our gaze towards the female model, the central focus of the painting.\nDetail of \u2018The Art of Painting\u2019 (1666\u20131668) by Johannes Vermeer. Oil on canvas. Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna. Image source Wikimedia Commons\nBeyond the curtain, the painting is made up of layers of activity. There is the near-edge of the table with coloured cloths hanging over the side; then, further forward, there is the artist at his easel; then there is the model stood at the far end of the table; and finally the wall with its huge map.\nThe purpose of these layers is to heighten the illusionistic impact of the painting. As the viewer, we are looking past the drape and into the room, inside of which a second painting is being made. This layering effect actually takes us to the very subject of the work, built up from a subtle interplay of symbols and allusions that, together, suggest an allegory of painting itself.\nThe model and artist\nThe focal point of the painting is undoubtedly the model: a young woman wearing blue stood beside a window. The brilliance of Vermeer\u2019s technique in capturing the effects of light is demonstrated here, by the way the glow from the window diffuses from the top-left corner of the painting without actually showing the window itself.\nThe model is laden with several items that suggest she is posing as an allegorical figure. She has a crown of laurel on her head, holds a trumpet in her right hand and a book in her left. Most likely she is dressed in the guise of Clio, the muse of history. The muses were the goddesses of creative inspiration. Over time, their number was established as nine and each represented a sphere of influence over learning and arts.\nDetail of \u2018The Art of Painting\u2019 (1666\u20131668) by Johannes Vermeer. Oil on canvas. Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna. Image source Wikimedia Commons\nIt\u2019s possible to recognise Clio because of the objects she holds: the crown of laurel denotes the honour and glory of history, the trumpet stands for fame, and the thick book, possibly by a historian such as Herodotus or Thucydides, alludes to knowledge of the past. These attributes match the description of Clio as given in Cesare Ripa\u2019s 16th century book, Iconologia, which was a highly influential text that described how artists ought to represent myths and allegories through emblems and symbols.\nSo, the scene we are looking at is of an artist painting a portrait of a model dressed up as the muse of history.\nOn the table in front of the model, there is a mask, probably as a symbol of imitation, and therefore an attribute of Painting. When seen along with the other items on the table \u2014 the pieces of cloth, a folio, a piece of leather \u2014 then it\u2019s possible to see them as collective symbols of the Liberal Arts. That is, the natural sciences, social sciences, arts and humanities.\nDetail of \u2018The Art of Painting\u2019 (1666\u20131668) by Johannes Vermeer. Oil on canvas. Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna. Image source Wikimedia Commons\nThe artist sits at his easel in the middle-ground of the painting. He has his back to us, so we see the same view as he does. We are also able to glimpse the painting he\u2019s working on, and can see he has begun his work with the laurel crown.\nBy hiding the artist\u2019s face, Vermeer has given him a universal quality. Notably, he is shown wearing expensive clothing, an elegant black doublet decorated with slits across the back and arms. My favourite detail is the pair of red stockings he is wearing, just visible beneath the seat of his stool.\nWhat is going on here? What do these collections of objects and symbols amount to?\nThe blending of references suggests that Vermeer meant to link the virtues of painting to the flow of history. And Vermeer places the artist at the heart of this evaluation.\nIt\u2019s important to remember that Vermeer lived at a time when the category of \u2018history painting\u2019 \u2014 which included subjects drawn from ancient Greek and Roman history, mythological, biblical and historical scenes \u2014 was widely considered the noblest form of painting.\nVermeer was not a history painter himself, but through this painting he is suggesting that artists are important transcribers of history. Moreover, art can be multi-faceted, can be layered, can describe and make reference, can present and perform \u2014 as evidenced in the very play of symbols within the work. In short, the Art of Painting is a celebration of the artist\u2019s talents.\nAnd there\u2019s more\u2026\nThe room\nThe idea of the importance of history \u2014 and the ability of the artist to capture it \u2014 is underlined by the story told through the large map that hangs on the wall at the end of the room.\nDetail of \u2018The Art of Painting\u2019 (1666\u20131668) by Johannes Vermeer. Oil on canvas. Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna. Image source Wikimedia Commons\nThe map shows a view of the Netherlands. It was made by the Dutch mapmaker Claes Jansz Visscher. If you look closely at the map, you can see that our commonplace view of the Netherlands has been turned through an angle of 90 degrees, so that north is shown on the right side and south on the left.\nDetail of \u2018The Art of Painting\u2019 (1666\u20131668) by Johannes Vermeer. Oil on canvas. Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna. Image source Wikimedia Commons\nDown the middle of the map, wonderfully blended with the patina of creases and folds that naturally gather over time, is a distinct shadow that divides north from south. This shadow broadly accords with the political division of the territory that occurred in 1648 following the Treaty of M\u00fcnster, which left the Dutch Republic to the north and southern provinces under Spanish Habsburg control.\nEven the brass chandelier hanging from the ceiling makes reference to the recent historical events: the shape resembles a two-headed eagle, the imperial symbol of the Habsburgs.\nVermeer\u2019s intention for the painting may have been as a kind of showpiece with which he could impress visiting patrons. It was one of the largest paintings he ever made: at 120 x 100 cm, it was second only to his Christ in the House of Martha and Mary in size.\nMoreover, Vermeer never sold the painting during his lifetime. Even when he died, his widow refused to hand it over to creditors, even though she and her children had been left with considerable debts.\nAs a painter, Vermeer was only moderately successful in his lifetime. He produced relatively few paintings, most of them showing domestic interior scenes like The Art of Painting. His popularity today attests to the flawlessness of his technique, his ability to illuminate space so brilliantly, and at the same time to fill it with tiny details that stimulate the viewer\u2019s imagination.\n\nWould you like to get\u2026\nA free guide to the Essential Styles in Western Art History, plus updates and exclusive news about me and my writing?

Viewed up close, the flesh can be seen to prickle with splinters and sores.

Image source Wikimedia Commons\nAs a reminder of the suffering that Christ endured during The Crucifixion, there is perhaps no other depiction as visceral as this altarpiece image, known as The Isenheim Altarpiece.\nIt is a masterpiece of German Renaissance art. It is also an image that, once seen, is never forgotten.\nDetail of \u2018The Isenheim Altarpiece\u2019 (between 1512 and 1515) by Matthias Gr\u00fcnewald & Nikolaus Hagenauer. Oil on panel. Mus\u00e9e Unterlinden, Colmar, France. Image source Wikimedia Commons\nTaking a wider view, we see Christ on the cross against a gloomy night-filled landscape.\nAbove Christ\u2019s head are the initials INRI. These represent the Latin inscription IESVS NAZARENVS REX IVD\u00c6ORVM (I\u0113sus Nazar\u0113nus, R\u0113x I\u016bdae\u014drum), which in English translates to \u201cJesus the Nazarene, King of the Jews\u201d.\nThe cross is flanked by mourners: on Christ\u2019s right is his mother, Mary, dressed in white, supported by John, the beloved disciple of Christ. Also on Christ\u2019s right is Mary Magdalene, kneeling with hands clasped in devoted prayer. And on Christ\u2019s left, John the Baptist accompanied by a lamb, symbolising the sacrifice of Jesus.\nThe painting, thought to have been made in between 1512 and 1515, represents the cruellest aspects of Christ\u2019s last days. With his head slumped to one side \u2014 in the final throes of suffocation that was the means of death for all crucified people \u2014 Christ\u2019s lips have turned a shade of blue and his mouth hangs open as if to expel a low howl of pain.\nThere are few paintings in the history of art that so avidly strip away the glory of Christ and show him instead as a fragile and wounded man. Just look at the feet, speared by that enormous nail, twisted and mangled, dripping with blood. It is a horror show in which the pain is harsh, raw and unvarnished.\nDetail of \u2018The Isenheim Altarpiece\u2019 (between 1509 and 1515) by Matthias Gr\u00fcnewald & Nikolaus Hagenauer. Oil on panel. Mus\u00e9e Unterlinden, Colmar, France. Image source WGA\nThe image was made for the Monastery of St. Anthony in Isenheim near Colmar, in north-east France, near the border with Germany.\nAs for the artist, little is known. The painter behind the work is known by the name Matthias Gr\u00fcnewald, yet his exact identity is uncertain. \u201cGr\u00fcnewald\u201d was a moniker attached by the first historian of German art, Joachim Sandrart, writing more than a century later. What is known is that Gr\u00fcnewald was born in W\u00fcrzburg in about 1475, was commissioned to paint works for churches in western Germany, and died in 1528.\nIt is interesting to note that The Isenheim Altarpiece was originally located in a church on the site of a monastic hospital.\nThe hospital is important in understanding the artwork, because the purpose of the hospital was to treat sufferers of the plague and also for a condition known as Saint Anthony\u2019s fire.\nSaint Anthony\u2019s fire derived its name from the medieval Benedictine monks dedicated to Saint Anthony who offered treatment to sufferers.\nSufferers of Saint Anthony\u2019s fire experienced visions, intense burning pain and the disfiguring effects of gangrene of the feet and hands. It is now known that the illness was caused by the consumption of fungus-contaminated rye grain, leading to ergot poisoning, or what is now called ergotism.\nThe Isenheim Altarpiece (between 1509 and 1515) by Matthias Gr\u00fcnewald & Nikolaus Hagenauer. Oil on panel. Mus\u00e9e Unterlinden, Colmar, France. Image source Wikimedia Commons\nAt the time, Saint Anthony\u2019s fire was deemed a spiritual ailment caused by temptation and sin; the remedy therefore was repentance and spiritual intervention. The image of the crucified Christ pitted with sores and riddled with thorns would leave the hospital patients with no doubt about Christ\u2019s own suffering, which seemed to resemble their own.\nThe Crucifixion scene is in fact just one part of a complex iconographical scheme of the wider altarpeice.\nOn either side of The Crucifixion, panels show the martyrdom of Saint Sebastian pierced by arrows (left) and Saint Anthony the Great (right). Again, the two saints relate to the hospital context, since Anthony was the patron saint of the victims of Saint Anthony\u2019s fire, whilst Saint Sebastian was invoked to ward off the plague.\nThe Isenheim Altarpiece with outer wings open (between 1509 and 1515) by Matthias Gr\u00fcnewald & Nikolaus Hagenauer.

When important festivals of the liturgical year arrived, the wings were opened to reveal scenes from the life of the Virgin Mary and scenes of the Nativity \u2014 thus spanning the life of Christ from beginning to end.\nYet what remains lodged in one\u2019s memory is the vision of Christ on the cross, skeleltal, pale and crushed.\nIn crucifying Christ in such a manner, humanity turned God into a humiliated and defeated \u201cman of sorrows\u201d \u2014 beyond which Christ\u2019s divinity can only be guessed at, barely imagined and somehow infinite in its terrible mystery.\nDetail of \u2018The Isenheim Altarpiece\u2019 (between 1512 and 1515) by Matthias Gr\u00fcnewald & Nikolaus Hagenauer.

Image source Wikimedia Commons\n**This article includes images that some may find disturbing\nAlfred Kubin was an Austrian illustrator and printmaker. His remarkable body of work \u2014 most especially his ink and wash drawings \u2014 contain strange spectral visions that point both to a troubled mind and an important talent.\nBorn in 1877, Kubin\u2019s adolescence was marked by episodes of depression and inner terror. Once, when visiting his mother\u2019s grave, he attempted suicide. The gun he used turned out to be rusty and failed to go off. At the age of 19, he entered the Austrian army only for the enlistment to result in a nervous breakdown.\nKubin\u2019s anxieties appear to have found some respite in art. By his early-twenties he had discovered the writings of Edgar Allan Poe and Fyodor Dostoevsky and was illustrating their works.\nHe deeply admired the imagery of Max Klinger, especially Klinger\u2019s prints which have about them a dreamlike \u2014 or rather nightmarish \u2014 quality. Under this inspiration, Kubin pursued an intense phase of drawing, producing an extraordinarily vivid and at times challenging portfolio of work.\nHere\u2019s a selection\u2026\nThe Witch (1900)\nThe Witch (1900) by Alfred Kubin. Ink and wash drawing. Image source WikiArt (public domain)\nIn this first image, titled The Witch, Kubin gives us a terrifying premonition of arbitrary power.\nOne of Kubin\u2019s early influences was the artist Francisco Goya, who made The Disasters of War series of plates between 1810 and 1820 \u2014 a likely inspiration for this macabre image of warfare or else a nightmarish vision of personal helplessness.\nOn the uppermost branch of a tree, a hair-raised woman sits with her arms aloft as if conducting an invisible orchestra, whilst on the tree below various figures hang by the neck.\nThe Lady on a Horse (1901)\nThe Lady on a Horse (1901) by Alfred Kubin. Ink and wash drawing. Image source WikiArt (public domain)\nIn 1898 Kubin went to Munich to study art. Here he developed his ink and wash technique that emulated the feel of the prints of Max Klinger.\nIn this drawing, titled The Lady on a Horse, a woman in a top-hat and an impressive black gown sits side-saddle on a rocking horse, whose rocking rails are made from enormous metal blades.\nAs a personal vision of the Femme Fatale figure, Kubin depicts an act of malevolent domination as the woman rocks back and forth, whilst beneath the blades figures are sliced up mercilessly.\nThe Moment of Birth (1902)\nThe Moment of Birth (1902) by Alfred Kubin. Ink and wash drawing. Image source WikiArt (public domain)\nIn 1902 Kubin had his first exhibition at the Cassirer Gallery in Berlin, and as his reputation increased, he was hired to complete numerous book illustrations.\nIn this image, The Moment of Birth, created in 1902, a monstrous crab with a head that is more like a skull, appears to draw out babies from a lake or canal. Like many of his various portrayals of bizarre animals, the image evokes a sinister expectation of an irrational reality.\nAnd yet, in a rare moment of joy, a newborn baby leaps joyously away and out into the world.\nOne Woman For All (1901)\nOne Woman For All (1901) by Alfred Kubin. Ink and wash drawing. Image source WikiArt (public domain)\nKubin\u2019s art turns a shade darker with a series of images in which his own troubled sexual destiny was expressed with repellent implications.\nAs mentioned, one enormous influence on the young Kubin was Max Klinger, about whose fantastical and often sexually charged images Kubin later wrote: \u201cHere a new art was thrown open to me, which offered free play for the imaginative expression of every conceivable world of feeling.

Almost all the Gettysburg equestrian statues follow the code, even if there is one exception: that of the statue of James Longstreet, whose horse has one leg raised despite the fact that Longstreet failed to die from his battle wounds.\nHowever, just a quick glance at other horsey statues around the world proves that as a general principle, this rubric is wholly inadequate, even if those at Gettysburg more or less conform by coincidence.\nReplica of the Equestrian Statue of Marcus Aurelius on the Capitoline Hill, Rome. Image source Wikimedia Commons\nLooking beyond Gettysburg, we can test the hypothesis on any number of equestrian statues. For instance, the famous statue of the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius that stands on Capitoline Hill, Rome, is a horse with a single hoof in the air.\nDuring his reign, Marcus led Rome into nearly constant battles, yet there is no suggestion that he suffered mortal wounds in one or several of them, and since he died of unknown causes at the age of 58 on 17 March 180AD, then any link to a battle seems untenable.\nLady Godiva (1949) a statue by Sir William Reid Dick. Image source Wikimedia Commons\nMy own personal point of reference here is the equestrian statue of Lady Godiva in Coventry in the UK, a town not far from where I grew up, whose horse steps forward with a single hoof raised.\nSince it is unlikely that Lady Godiva ever fought in battle, it is hard to see what the raised foot is referring to \u2014 except for the more interesting fact that Lady Godiva is said to have ridden through the town naked. Moreover, little is known about the circumstances of her death, only that it probably occurred sometime between 1066 and 1086.\nTherefore, it seems clear to me that the sculptor, Sir William Reid Dick, who completed the work in 1949, could not possibly have been following the Gettysburg model when he designed his model.\nAnd so we can confidently conclude that this idea is definitely a myth: the portrayal of the horse\u2019s hooves has nothing to do with how the rider died.\n\nIf you liked this, you might like my book Great Paintings Explained, an examination of fifteen of art\u2019s most enthralling images:\nGreat Paintings Explained | Christopher P Jones | Author & Writer on Art & Culture\nChristopher P Jones is a novelist, art critic and historianwww.chrisjoneswrites.co.uk\nWould you like to get\u2026\nA free guide to the Essential Styles in Western Art History, plus updates and exclusive news about me and my writing?

After posing in front of a futuristic version of Wall Street\u2019s Charging Bull, the crypto giant\u2019s most loyal fans, promoters, developers, and shills entered the main hall of the Miami Beach Conference Center, to listen to a range of speeches confirming their long-standing prophecy: Bitcoin will become the future of money \u2014 and it might make them rich for doing the least amount of toil in the process.\nTwo days in, on April 7th, it was Silicon Valley king Peter Thiel\u2019s turn to promote Bitcoin\u2019s prominent agenda of separating money from state power. Since Thiel has said in the past that he no longer believes \u201cfreedom and democracy are compatible,\u201d it\u2019s no surprise his speech was instantly controversial. After calling fellow billionaires Blackrock CEO Larry Fink, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, and Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett members of a \u201cfinance gerontocracy,\u201d Thiel went on, as expected, to also lament the Federal Reserve, specifically head honcho Jerome Powell. The latter actors have become the primary adversaries of not only Thiel but Bitcoin devotees \u2014 as a recent graphic by Bitcoin Magazine, showing a fiery asteroid about to collide with the Fed\u2019s Eccles Building, so vehemently illustrated.\nAnyone who\u2019s studied up on Thiel\u2019s past, though, will undoubtedly find his ongoing distaste for state institutions somewhat hypocritical. In an article for Jacobin, Paris Marx reveals that Thiel was one of the various soon-to-be tech oligarchs who held neoliberal views contra to the supposed Silicon Valley liberal stereotype, a mismatch which came to be known as the Californian Ideology. In 1999, for instance, shortly after declaring that his newly created PayPal would \u201ctear down the financial establishment,\u201d Thiel quickly backtracked and complied with government regulation at the very first hurdle. It was only after he started following the rules that his empire and subsequent wealth began to take off.\nThiel, of course, is by no means the only elite to hold an insincere stance on regulation if it benefits them financially, especially when it comes to cryptocurrency. In fact, the fellow billionaires he criticized in his latest Bitcoin speech have openly displayed resentment for crypto, yet have also discreetly jumped on the bandwagon.\nWarren Buffett, after calling Bitcoin \u201crat poison squared\u201d had no trouble investing in a billion-dollar Brazilian startup providing crypto services. Meanwhile, Larry Fink, in his latest letter to shareholders, welcomed both unregulated stablecoins and state-issued CBDCs (central bank digital currencies). As for JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, despite his various dunks on cryptocurrency, he\u2019s allowed his megabank to create various blockchain products, even selling some on to members of the crypto elite. The most prominent example was a deal that anyone peddling the crypto liberation narrative would have wanted to remain out of the spotlight: the sale of JPMorgan\u2019s Quorum blockchain to ConsenSys Inc, a company established and run by Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin.\nIt\u2019s clear now that the level of crypto duplicity within the billionaire class is now mooning harder than a run-of-the-mill sh*tcoin. Despite their most overt objections, the hidden lure of bypassing lawful boundaries through crypto has become too tempting. Voracious financiers, as usual, can\u2019t keep their hands off the rising number of technological tools that enable them to sidestep societal laws and regulations to enrich themselves. And whether or not they care to admit it, crypto has become their preferred means to do so.\nFor more analysis and ideas, subscribe to my mailing list.\nYou can also follow me on Twitter and here on Medium.

Mike Tyson promoted his latest NFT (non-fungible token) collection in partnership with Binance, the world\u2019s largest casino posing as a platform that enables \u201cfinancial freedom\u201d \u2014 whatever that means. Meanwhile, the U.K Treasury asked the Royal Mint to construct its own NFT to show Britain was \u201cat the cutting edge for new technologies\u201d. The most intriguing moment, however, came shortly after when Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced that the U.K was to become the global \u201ccrypto asset technology hub.\u201d\nIts primary strategy? To recognize stablecoins, cryptocurrencies designed to equal one unit of a particular fiat currency, most of which have dubious reserves governed by well-known, crooked actors, as \u2014 get this! \u2014 a \u201cvalid form of payment\u201d.\nThe uneasy laughs only increased from here. On the same day, at the \u201cStop Scams\u201d conference held by the BOE (Bank of England), governor Andrew Bailey dubbed the crypto industry an \u201copportunity for the downright criminal.\u201d Yet following a call on financial entities, tech firms, and government institutions to cooperate with the U.K central bank \u201cto tackle scams against consumers,\u201d he not only bizarrely admitted this would \u201cnever\u201d be achieved. But as the U.K Treasury had done previously went on to echo crypto advocates\u2019 optimistic vindications that suppressing the rise of crypto would be \u201cstifling innovation,\u201d despite how crypto itself remains an overtly dubious industry.\nThe initial idea around crypto has always been to circumvent the laws that power structures have implemented over centuries to prevent rampant, widescale fraud and disorder in society. Yet for some reason, as the latest crypto debacle in Blighty shows, the industry most capable of creating swindles and encouraging criminality has been given a free pass from scrutiny, under the rationale that everyone has been suppressing innovation, thereby preventing the \u201ccrypto revolution\u201d from ever materializing.\nCrypto, in reality, is the latest \u201cdisruptive\u201d but overhyped technology, a snappy rerun of the entire history of modern finance, plus all the mistakes, errors, and fixes that came with it.\nIt\u2019s a \u201cbogus innovation\u201d trojan horse, where blockchain is being used to satisfy advocates\u2019 daydreams of a frankly unattainable, decentralized and elite-free world, and overshadowing that it\u2019s merely software, specifically a janky, inefficient database you can\u2019t edit, update, or delete, invented using tech from the 1970s. Since blockchain remains slower, more costly, and less efficient than existing systems, its proliferation relies on its proponents claiming various power structures, for instance, nation-states, are burying \u201cthe future of finance,\u201d which increasingly looks to be a cover for justifying the existence of unfettered private money.\nThe end result of this modern twist to a centuries-old experiment with private money is not a utopia, but the normalization of the omission of rules, laws, and regulations, which authorities have enforced to prevent the financial sphere from turning into a fraud-ridden hellscape. Providing you have bypassed its many propaganda outlets, this is precisely what the status quo in crypto has become.\nAlso on Monday, TechCrunch reported a whopping 695% year-over-year rise in crypto losses resulting from \u201chacks,\u201d in the first quarter of 2022. DeFi, crypto-speak for \u201cdecentralized finance\u201d, saw its biggest hack only last week, with the \u201cplay-to-earn\u201d game Axie Infinity having $625 million stolen from its proprietary Ronin Wallet. This theft increased total losses in the DeFi/web3 ecosystem to a whopping $1.23 billion for Q1.\nThough, as Gotham actor-turned-crypto critic Ben McKenzie recently prophesied, it\u2019s only the beginning of a justified and prolonged crypto crimewave, one that now has the apparent full backing of the U.K government, the same archetypical power structure crypto was allegedly trying to subvert.\nFor more analysis and ideas, subscribe to my mailing list.\nYou can also follow me on Twitter and here on Medium.

But nevertheless, on Crypto Twitter, it became almost impossible to tell what was a joke and what was real. For the so-called \u201cfuture of finance\u201d, it was business as usual.\nCrypto remains a bizarre nexus of Ponzi scams posing as an intricate arcade game, in which speculators play digital \u201chot potato\u201d with illegal securities. It\u2019s the first cult-like ecosystem to obscure itself by combining corporate-speak and technobabble into one native dialect, so much that even the executives of pyramid schemes like Herbalife and Amway, operating under the disguise of \u201cmulti-level marketing,\u201d can\u2019t believe what they\u2019re seeing.\nIn fact, we\u2019re watching a replay of how the multi-level marketing (MLM) industry lobbied the SEC (Securities Exchange Commission) to normalize blatantly illegal pyramid schemes, this time with the crypto industry. Today, 1 in 6 households are involved with MLMs, of which 99% of people are losing money. Yet these are still not considered frauds. Instead, MLMs (multi-level marketing schemes) remain pressed against the border between illegal and unethical.\n\u2724\nThe likeness between MLMs and crypto is uncanny. Only the latter has added gaslighting and lawlessness sprinkled on top for good measure. Every single cryptocurrency has a cult-like sentiment attached to it. At the least, it has multi-level marketing \u201cvibes\u201d, and at the most, it\u2019s a full-on ideology with its own lingo, indoctrination centers, and propaganda machine. Like Scientology, but on steroids.\n\u2724\nAs we see with most predatory schemes, quite a few techies and finance people are reluctant to voice their concerns about crypto and Web3. They can\u2019t because it\u2019s detrimental to their position to point out flaws in a technology that has created an ideological aura in their working environment \u2014 one of the hallmarks of cult mentality.\nAs Concoda has previously mentioned, America has already normalized pyramid schemes through multi-level marketing. Now it\u2019s time for the authorities to submit to the new-age fintech oligarchy, legalizing Ponzi schemes through crypto.\n\u2724\n\n\u2724\nThis Friday, the entire Bitcoin maxi establishment descended on my Twitter feed harder than 21 million Will Smith \u201cright palms\u201d. The odd part about this was that I merely forecasted the majority of Americans would stick with the U.S Dollar, not move into Bitcoin. I wasn\u2019t even talking about people outside America, yet they collectively concluded I was an evil anti-humanitarian boogeyman.\nIn 2022, it\u2019s apparently controversial to say that people will use their country\u2019s currency over what effectively is a counterfeit version of fiat. There\u2019s no other subject in the media, other than crypto, where they have people declaring regularly that anything emerging from the space is a \u201cscam\u201d or \u201cPonzi scheme.\u201d It\u2019s almost as if they could be onto something.\n\u2724\nDespite what the maximalists say, Bitcoin is undoubtedly the same as other cryptocurrencies, only much slower, less efficient, and more disastrous for the environment, plus a lot of its holders seem overly enthusiastic about the collapse of their own sovereign currency. Ironically, Bitcoin has turned into the true \u201csh*tcoin.\u201d\n\u2724\nBitcoin has never been about liberating the masses. That narrative has been debunked by yours truly. Instead, it was conceived to evade societal boundaries for self-enrichment, meaning it\u2019s the most \u201cdishonest\u201d and \u201ccorruptable\u201d money on the planet; the exact opposite of Bitcoin doctrine.\n\u2724\nBitcoin can never become the world\u2019s reserve currency. It\u2019s totally incompatible with modern forms of finance and money, which are always a reflection of global economic conditions. It\u2019s like advocating for a monarchy rule in Great Britain.\nIn a Bitcoin economy, not only will consumers end up hoarding money, but businesses will hoard resources, realizing they benefit more from saving than producing products. Both sides being disincentivized to transact is the major flaw in deflationary currencies.\n\u2724\n\u201cPeople were content with horses and buggies.\u201d\n\u201cPeople were content with flip phones.\u201d\n\u201cPeople were content with VHS tapes.\u201d\n\u201cLook how that turned out!\u201d\nWell, yeh. I can definitely see the masses \u201cupgrading\u201d from a highly stable sovereign currency to an enormous Ponzi scheme by next winter.\n\u2724\nFiat currency is simply most people in the world exiting from their utopian fantasies into reality and contributing to economic growth. Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme, multi-level marketing scheme, and pyramid scheme, all combined into one perpetual zero-coupon bond of societal, monetary, and environmental destruction.\n\u2724\nA reminder that an NFT is just a block containing a link to a website, which has a URL pointing to some file. This is a fad, not the future of ownership. Every problem NFTs have tried to solve has been remedied in the real world by a company already years ahead in technology and innovation.\nThat, of course, is apart from crypto VC firm Andreessen Horowitz, the leading innovator in evading securities laws and regulations.\n\u2724\nIf NFTs involve spending real money to buy fake money to purchase pretend property rights, in effect the NFT ecosystem has become an elaborate version of Monopoly, which explains why the major use cases for Ethereum \u2014 the most popular blockchain on which to \u201cmint\u201d NFTs \u2014 includes buying and selling \u201cvirtual land\u201d.\n\u2724\nCritics say there\u2019s no superior use case for crypto, but it\u2019s incredibly proficient at forming cult mentalities around links to images of zoo animals, especially unhappy primates. That makes the gargantuan amount of hype and publicity worth it.\nRight?\n\u2724\n\n\u2724\nLeaving a crypto cult is a soul-crushing experience of slowly acknowledging the existence of basic economics, externalities, political science, propaganda, and monetary history. It\u2019s worth it, but few understand this.\n\u2724\nCrypto skepticism is not \u201chating\u201d. It\u2019s simply providing a critique of what the \u201cother side\u201d thinks about money, politics, economics, and more. It\u2019s no different from the commentary you\u2019ll find in the political realm.\nIf something is declaring itself the next big thing, it\u2019s essential to have a skeptical community critiquing it. But with crypto, that\u2019s especially important. Leaving the shady individuals within the crypto elite alone and the issues within the space unchallenged won\u2019t end well.\n\u2724\nCrypto critics are people in various professions simply pointing out how their field of expertise in the legacy system solves the issues that crypto has created for itself, by effectively starting over from scratch.\n\u2724\nThe legacy system is not without flaws. SPACs (Special Purpose Acquisition Companies) might as well be the cryptocurrencies of traditional finance. They are much quicker than the traditional IPO route and insiders can negotiate a bigger premium for what usually is a lower quality company.\nNo wonder that\u2019s the route Circle, the issuer of unaudited stablecoin USDC, has taken.\nProbably nothing.\n\u2724\nReject the financialization of everything. It\u2019s a dystopia you won\u2019t want to live in, created by people who don\u2019t foresee what they\u2019re instituting. Some things just don\u2019t need markets and money attached to them.\n\u2724\nWhile conventional finance and economics describe the state of the world accurately, crypto is based on a mix of new but mostly old dubious theories that, if enforced, would quickly need to be replaced with the status quo.\nIt\u2019s not just a bad revisionist attempt at money but a complete rewind of modern finance, an enormous campaign to normalize the removal of rules and institutions that we\u2019d simply add back again, once those who campaigned to get rid of them realized why they had been implemented in the first place.\n\u2724\nThe end game for crypto is financialization overload, where we revert to bartering over money itself.

It was another of those albums in the collection of the boyfriend of my older sister. He would leave this, along with an eclectic mix of other albums, at our home for weeks at a time, so I was able to dive in and listen to them whenever I wished. It wasn\u2019t long before this became one of my favourites and I had scraped enough money together to buy my own copy.\nMy dad approved too. Always eager to win his favour and attention, this probably contributed to my affection for the album. Being a big fan of classical music my dad was fairly disdainful of most rock music. But I remember him holding this album sleeve aloft in his hand to announce, \u2018This is classical stuff!.\u2019\nRelationships between my mum and dad had disintegrated over the last few years. Not long after this period their marriage would be over, and dad moved out. But for now, the household was full of their bile and resentment towards each other. The walls would reverberate with their angry voices during fights that sometimes became physical.\nI remember an occasion when Dad came down to breakfast looking unrecognisable. The previous evening Mum and Dad had argued culminating in Mum throwing an alarm clock at him, catching him full in the face. Next morning his appearance was shocking. One eye was swollen and closed up, and a side of his face was a rainbow of bruising. Half a century later and I can still recall the image without effort, with all its stark vividness intact.\nI was placed in the hopeless position of being forced to pick sides. Dad faded to the background of my life, but I still missed him and looked for ways of regaining his trust, despite the divided loyalties. Music was one avenue to gaining some recognition from him. As well as my saviour, my route to escape from some of the ugliness of family life, music was a way of connecting with a parent whom I felt was slipping away from me.\nThe Nice was a progressive rock trio, with jazz and classical music influences. As well as original compositions they also created dramatic rearrangements of classical themes as well as the songs of Bob Dylan and other singer/songwriters such as Tim Hardin\u2019s Hang on to a Dream.\nKeith Emerson was the main driving force and showman of the band on Hammond organ and piano, with a rhythm section of Brain Davison on drums and Lee Jackson on bass guitar and vocals. Inspired by the showmanship of Jimi Hendrix, Emerson would leap over his organ and throw knives into the keys to sustain chords and vibrato effects. Lemmy (soon to be of Hawkwind then Mot\u00f6rhead fame) was one of their original roadies who bequeathed Emerson an old Nazi dagger to lend more dramatic effect to his performance.\nThe Five Bridges Suite took up side one of the vinyl album. It was a piece for the band and orchestra, commissioned by the Newcastle Arts Festival. The suite referred to the then five bridges, spanning the River Tyne (there are now seven) and was recorded live for the album on 17th October 1969 from Croydon\u2019s Fairfield Halls.\nThe piece starts with the full orchestra \u2013 The Sinfonia of London orchestra conducted by Joesph Eger \u2013 playing the main theme, with Keith Emerson playing solo parts on piano. The second section has the trio without orchestra which then moves into a chorale. This has Lee Jackson on breathy vocals, recalling memories of his childhood in Newcastle, backed by the orchestra with piano interludes courtesy of Emerson. Then we\u2019re into a complex piano fugue, punctuated by Davison\u2019s crashing cymbals. The finale is a reprise of the second section although with the addition of jazz horn players.\nOn side 2, the live performances continue from the same recording with a rocking version of Intermezzo by Sibelius and than a rearrangement of Tchaikovsky\u2019s Pathetique Symphony, 3rd movement, ending with a fiery drum solo from Davison. In both pieces the more traditional approaches from the orchestra is juxtaposed with the rock interpretations from the band.\nThe album concludes with a version of Dylan\u2019s jazzy Country Pie that is fused with Bach\u2019s Brandenburg Concerto Number 6 and a studio recording of One of those People.\nThe late sixties and early seventies were a time when many rock bands, out to prove their musical chops, would flirt with orchestras and classical themes, including such notables as Deep Purple, The Moody Blues and Barclay James Harvest. The Nice used classical influences throughout their career. And none did it better than this trio. Keith Emerson continued in this vein when he broke up The Nice in order to form Emerson Lake and Palmer (ELP), unleashing a rock interpretation of the classical Pictures of an Exhibition by Mussorgsky on an unsuspecting public.\nFive Bridges reached number 2 in the UK album charts. In Q and Mojo\u2019s \u201840 Cosmic Rock Albums\u2019 it claimed a place at number 29.\nI still have my old vinyl copy, I bought over fifty years ago, sitting alongside its cd counterpart. My dad has long since passed. But, even now when I touch this album, I can see him still, exclaiming with surprise and excitement,\nThis is classical stuff.\nIf you enjoyed this story and would like to read more, please click on the \u2018follow\u2019 button and, also, sign up for my weekly newsletter.\nIf you\u2019re thinking of subscribing to Medium at a mere fiver a month, giving you access to thousands of gifted writers, ranging over a huge variety of subjects, please support me by using this referral link.

I saw the iconic photo on the album sleeve , all electrified bushy hair, busting out from above a brown suede jacket and chequered scarf, looking slightly out of focus, and peering out at me, with that inscrutable expression from the depths of our parents\u2019 teak veneered stereogram. Okay this wasn\u2019t his ideal milieu. Not a family stereogram. Sorry Bob, your Bobness. Yet, despite the aesthetic outrage, music from a sideboard was quite The Thing back in the day. Although, unlike Dylan\u2019s album, it wasn\u2019t something that stood the test of time. Families bought radiograms to be updated to stereograms. While students and hipsters \u2014 with higher standards both aesthetic and audio \u2014 bought separate Hi Fi equipment, complete with fuck off speakers rising up like two venerable monoliths from the floors of countless bedsits, ready for the music to sparkle and spark as the diamond stylus gently lowered onto newly pressed vinyl.\nBlonde on Blonde was the last of a trilogy, set apart from his earlier folk albums by the introduction of rock n\u2019 roll. Someone called out\nJudas\nat Manchester Free Trade Hall in England. The moment encapsulated the outrage of his fans for Dylan\u2019s audacity at going electric. It was 17th May 1966. The album had been released in the US the previous day, although the UK had to wait another month before its release. Bringing It All Back Home and Highway 61 Revisited had already registered the change in his direction, from acoustic troubadour of the civil rights movement to post modern electric poet, replete with Coleridge\u2019s image of\nhis flashing eyes, his floating hair.\nAll three albums were glittering and essential moments in his career. Dylan spat back at the heckler (a certain Keith Butler from Keel University),\nI don\u2019t believe you\nreferencing the title to a song he had just played and continued with,\nyou\u2019re a liar.\nBefore launching into Like a Rolling Stone, he doubled down by turning to the band, saying,\nplay it fucking loud.\nLooking back at the incident many decades later it is hard to fathom the depth of anger towards Dylan and that the change in his musical direction turned him into a traitor for many of his erstwhile fans. Even Keith Butler reflects on his younger self as a\nsilly young bugger.\nBut, hey, we\u2019ve all been there. Except most of us don\u2019t get to be recorded as a twat, representing a defining moment of the sixties. Sorry, Keith, you\u2019re on your own there.\nBack to my parents stereogram\u2026 I approached the musical sideboard cautiously and withdrew the album, resplendent with Dylan\u2019s foggy image staring back at me. I had heard that one side was devoted to one song, so I went straight for the jugular and Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands. Verse after verse of romantic imagery tumbled out from the speakers accompanied by acoustic guitar and harmonica, backed by a restrained rhythm and Al Kooper\u2019s thin organ chords as part of\nthat thin, that wild mercury sound,\nto keep it all rolling forward. The song was a paean to his new wife, Sara. Rather than writing it day after day in the Chelsea Hotel, as according to his later song, Sara, off the Desire album, he actually wrote much of the lyrics off the hoof during the process of recording.\nFrustrated with his early attempts of recording a new album, Bob Dylan decamped from the New York studios and travelled to Nashville, taking musicians Robbie Robertson and Al Kooper with him. They holed up at the Columbia A studios in Music Row and recruited the best of Nashville\u2019s session men to breathe fresh life into the project. The musical tension between Dylan\u2019s hipsters, Robertson and Kooper, and Nashville\u2019s finest, probably helped to imbue the album with its unique sound quality. Dylan\u2019s own wild literary aesthetic played off against the grounded professionalism of the hourly paid session musicians, that pushed and pulled the musical direction of the album to previously unknown heights, stretching many of the musicians beyond all their expectations.\nThroughout the recording Dylan remained a remote presence. For the recording of Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands he was four hours late to the studio and the song\u2019s lyrics were still unfinished. So that Dylan could work on their completion, the musicians vacated the studio and hung out in the offices downstairs, sending out for food when necessary. In the middle of the night, while struggling to stay awake, they were called back to the studio and given the briefest of rundowns before the red light winked on and they launched into a take. Having no conception of the song\u2019s length, assuming it would be the normal 2\u20133 minute duration, the band worked towards a climax, only for Dylan to catapult into another verse. And another. And repeat for 11 minutes, 23 seconds representing the longest popular song recorded up to that time.\nAll the songs on the album were completed in one or two takes. Dylan would run through each song with his musicians but never completely from top to bottom. The duration of the song was never known or even the direction it was heading due to Bob\u2019s tendency to improvise while the red light was on. He was creating as he was recording.\nYou had to be on your toes,\nremarked one of the musicians. Surely, a monument to epic understatement.\nThe first track on the album had the refrain \u2018everybody must get stoned.\u2019 For the sake of authenticity, Dylan was not about to record this with \u2018a bunch of straight people.\u2019 So he sent out for green shots of Leprechaun cocktails from a nearby Irish bar and the finest marijuana a rock star could obtain. Which had to be pretty fine, no doubt in the ranks of the finest. Indeed the bassist recalled,\nIt was pretty strong stuff.\nNot satisfied with playing stoned, the musicians were promptly required to swap instruments before the take. Bob wanted a sound of a marching band, but not too slick. He wanted the sound to be a little off, slightly ragged. With the band members self-declared as \u2018fucked up,\u2019 he got the desired sound. It was a bold and triumphant start to the album. A statement of intent that delivered all that was promised over the next 72 minutes.\nEveryone assumed that this first track would be called \u2018Everybody must get stoned.\u2019 After all, it was repeated enough through the duration of the track. But not a bit of it. In response to this half-joke question of the song\u2019s title, Bob replied that the track was Rainy Day Women #12 and #35, without a flicker of a smile.\nThe lyrics on Blonde on Blonde were some of the best of his career. His work on the album must have been a major contribution to receiving the Nobel Prize for Literature many years later. For instance, take the lyrics on Visions of Joanna one of the many standout tracks on the album. A rich verse of imagery flows unceasingly through the music. Such as\nThe ghost of electricity howls in the bones of her face\nAnd\nIn this room the heat pipes just cough\nAs Al Kooper commented\nNobody has ever captured the sound of 3 am better than that album.\nBob was devoting all that he had to his art. Even his personal hygiene was something to be sacrificed. From his hair \u2014 whispering something in Bob\u2019s ear was like \u2018sticking your face in a bush\u2019 \u2014 to his fingernails that were unusually long, even for a guitarist\u2026 and particularly grimy. In fact it was commented,\nThere was a certain air about him.\nBut what does any of that really matter when at the end of it all you got Blonde On Blonde. An album ranked by critics as being one of the best of all time. In 2020, 54 years after its release, Rolling Stone magazine placed the album at number 38 in the 500 Greatest Albums of all Time.\nSince first seeing the album at home and playing Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands, I\u2019ve been playing all the other gems on this album for over fifty years. And it\u2019s not about to gather dust yet. It was one of the first of the double vinyls that has seen off all other double album contenders that came in its wake. It foreshadowed much of what was to come, but was shadowed by none. It has sweat, blood and beauty. It is where poetry meets rock music. Where the literary converses with the streets, and with the lust of cheap hotels and amphetamines. It is an album that keeps giving.\nIf you enjoyed this story and would like to read more, please sign up for my weekly newsletter and/or sign up to just receive an email whenever I publish.\nIf you\u2019re thinking of subscribing to Medium at a mere fiver a month, giving you access to thousands of gifted writers, ranging over a huge variety of subjects, please support me by using this referral link.

At the time of our divorce my wife said I had made our whole time together a sham, a big joke. She sounded like she thought I had planned it all from the very beginning and I was just playing along for all the time we were married. Not truly loving her, just plotting my escape.\nThis was her pain talking, her confusion, I know. She was hurt. She felt deeply betrayed. And she extended my betrayal across the whole of our time together.\nMy betrayal was real enough. But for the last few weeks. That was enough. And my guilt was visceral, cutting deep into my being, pulling and stretching at the fibres that kept me together. Anything she threw at me, I knew I deserved, and more.\nAnd anything that helped her was okay. But the idea of our whole time together being in some way phoney was not okay. It wasn\u2019t true and it wasn\u2019t helpful, especially not to her. Such thoughts could only reap more pain.\nI had tried to mumble this to her but we weren\u2019t connecting. Of course not. I had loved her. In fact, at the time of our split I still loved her, even though I knew we were over. Again, it was something I kept to myself. Filed under all those other things put down as \u2018not useful to know.\u2019 My own inner conflicts and mixed emotions would stay my own. But the truth is that love is not like a tap to be turned off and on whenever it suits. My love for her stood for all we had created together. Our two lovely children and all the moments from our past. But it was a love without a future. I was still loving someone who was no longer part of my future.\nUp until that moment I had always been disdainful of men who split from their wives or/and had an affair. It was easy to get on my holier than thou horse and look down on all those failed and contemptible husbands. Those sad apologies for human beings. And from the moment of my own failure it was easy, though painful, to see myself as others saw me. As I would have seen myself had I not been me. But I shied away from self-hate. Somehow I needed to be able to continue to live with myself.\nMy guilt was centred on my children. So for awhile I kidded myself that nothing would change. I even applied for joint custody until I was gently told by my solicitor I had no chance of winning. The law was not on my side. Course not. And any further fight would just prolong the misery for everyone. So I handed in my badge of being a fully paid up member of parenthood. It changed my identity and the person that I saw each morning in the mirror. Neither better or worse. No moral absolutes. Just change. But who am I kidding? It was the mental equivalent of losing a leg.\nMy generation, born between 46 and 65, the so-called \u2018Baby Boomers,\u2019 have the dubious distinction of being the largest single generation in history. We embraced divorce like no other generation before or, indeed, after us.\nOften seen as the self-centred, \u2018Me Generation\u2019 (\u2018talking\u2019 about my g-g-generation\u2019) we sacrificed the values of duty and moral rectitude on the altar of individuality. We lifted the idea of individualism to quasi religious heights, breaking down many of the traditional social constructs and boundaries. Enter the civil rights movements, rock n\u2019 roll, tv and free-for-all debt.\nFor the first time in history women had the economic means to live independently of a male partner. And with the increase on the emphasis of individuality, divorce became more widely accepted as the go-to action plan for dealing with an unhappy marriage.\nThis trend has continued amongst Baby Boomers. In the last two decades the divorce rate for 55\u201364 year olds has more than doubled, while for the 65s plus group it has more than tripled.\nNot so for the succeeding generation: Generation X. A smaller group than their predecessor, they were the first generation of children who witnessed divorced parents as normal, a fact of life.\nBut rather than continue the trend set by their parents, Generation X have responded by staying married or not marrying at all. Once more, saying \u2018I do,\u2019 is more likely to mean \u2018till death do us part.\u2019\nSo for better or worse, in sickness or in health, I belong to the generation who embraced divorce as a genuine lifestyle option. I guess there are better legacies. Though there are certainly worse. And given all that was presented to me all those years ago I\u2019d have no reason to change the actions I took. And it saddens me to say this, knowing all the pain and grief I was to inflict on others. Yet some relationships even the best, the most intense, are not always built for longevity. And this risk increases the younger you get married. During our twenties through to our early thirties, we change dramatically as people. The person I was at 18 was not the same person I became aged 33. Nor would I wish to be. So there is a high risk that any change will also include who we wish as a partner to continue the rest of our lives with. Of course, the change can work in the opposite direction and two people can grow further together. But it\u2019s a helluva risk with no money back guarantees.\nYet, I was meant to marry when I did. We had some very good years and parented two wonderful children who have given us wonderful grandchildren. I could not possibly deny so much of life\u2019s bounty. How could I possibly wish this away?\nAnd it\u2019s been over two decades since all that pain and rancour was put behind us and we were able to return to each other as important figures from our past, who are still fastened by that past. There is much maturity in that. Especially on the side of my ex-wife whose subsequent journey was different from mine. And a type of attachment that continues to exist all while our family continues to thrive, and stay bonded through love.\nIf you enjoyed this story and would like to read more, please sign up for my weekly newsletter and/or sign up to receive an email whenever I publish.\nIf you\u2019re thinking of subscribing to Medium at a mere fiver a month, giving you access to thousands of gifted writers, ranging over a huge variety of subjects, please support me by using this referral link.

That is, as you get older, the more you live in memory. So when it comes to the end, memory is all you have. Well, I\u2019m not quite there yet, but as I\u2019ve reached well past sixty, I have more behind me than I have ahead, so naturally my thoughts increasingly stray to my past and all the events and feelings that have led to now. Of course, as I\u2019ve mentioned in previous pieces, memory is a notoriously unreliable beast and all events recalled from a misty past are wrought by a process of interpretation, coloured by feeling and occasional confabulation.\nWhen I first recalled the summer of 67 and the story of my eldest sister and I, the initial images did not concur with reality. I saw my sister as a footloose and fancy free teenager. She was the one who bought the forever cool Whiter Shade of Pale by Procol Harum whereas I opted for the mostly forgotten Grocer Jack/Excerpt from a teenage opera by Keith West. Yet by the summer of this year, despite being only 17, she was neither footloose nor fancy free, having given birth to a boy that April. Being unmarried was still a little scandalous back then. The father shunned all responsibility and ducked out of view. After giving birth, my sister returned to our family home, not much bigger than a crisp bag. Living with her new baby alongside our two parents and her three younger siblings, well\u2026 it was not easy. Eventually things came to a head and she would leave the overcrowded family nest to move into a \u2018home for unmarried mothers\u2019 a few miles away. Yes, there were such things back then.\nIn 67 I was 9 coming to 10 later that year. It was not a happy home. The previous year my dad became bankrupt and we moved under the cover of darkness from our 17th century, Grade II listed, carriage-entrance home to a three bedroomed council house in a nearby village. Our parents were already at each other\u2019s throats. And the enforced move and the stress of our reduced economic status only made things worse. But this was all adult stuff as unhappy as it was. And I remained resolutely blind to as much of it as I possibly could. Besides, the move, however ignoble I heard it was, had lots of adventurous possibilities. Many of the homes on the council estate were still being built when we first arrived. So we moved into what was essentially still a building site. Any building site for any kid is really just an adventure playground, with no added safety rules or any type of adult supervision. It was brilliant.\nBut the day I recall in 67, is when my sister bought a single and she offered to buy one for me as well. The family had little money so this was a big deal. But realising the date of this occurrence I have to qualify the memory with the realisation that she was already a mother. Her teenage days were long over while she was still a teenager. I need to scrawl out the image of her still being a carefree teenager, and replace it with what? A blank space stares back at me, now as it did then. We were seven years apart, a separation that becomes a vanishing point on the horizon.\nAnd our choice of records spoke volumes to who we were, the images of both remain with me, tucked away, out of sight but still forever part of me. A Whiter Shade of Pale remains one of the coolest and greatest singles ever in the history of popular music. From the opening melody, taken from Bach\u2019s Air on a G String, to Gary Brooker\u2019s soulful vocals, singing Keith Reid\u2019s immortal, psychedelic lyrics, the whole song is a bona fide classic. Although an anthem from the so-called Summer of Love, it has transcended its time to become an anthem for all time. And over 1000 cover versions have given credence to this. And that was my sister. Her choice. When she told me the record she had chosen to buy, all I had was a question mark over my head. What the fuck was A Whiter Shade of Pale?\nGrocer Jack, I could relate to. It told a story about Grocer Jack who is teased and derided by the local children in the village that he serves. Only when he suddenly dies do they realise his worth. Not only was Grocer Jack a nice story with characters, it hinted at greater things to come. It was after all an excerpt from a presumed up and coming teenage opera. But, of course, it remained just this one and only single that has stood the test of time not to well. Do I hear, trite? Overly sentimental? Anyone? Actually, it wasn\u2019t literally the one and only contribution to the larger project. A second single called Sam was released from the same proposed teenage opera. But when this failed to reach the heights of Grocer Jack \u2014 at number 2 in the UK charts, held off from the number one spot by Englebert Humperdinck\u2019s Last Waltz \u2014 the whole project withered away and died. So that was me. My choice.\nThe music choices frozen forever on that day, represent how I saw our two characters. She was older, she had her finger on the pulse of what was going on which made her effortlessly cool. And she was strong, both mentally and physically, and fearless. While I was\u2026 well, nuff said, I think.\nBefore The Move, we had chickens in the back yard of our old house and a very pugnacious cockerel. When they escaped from their coop, as happened regularly, the cock would strut around the yard and attack anyone who dared try to cross to the other half of the garden, with flying beak and sharp claws. One of my other sisters and I would regularly get trapped in the garden, unable to reach the safety of the house due to this marauding cockerel. My older sister thought nothing of crossing the yard from the house to reach us and then piggy back us across the yard to the house, one at a time. Once we were all safely tucked in the kitchen, I looked down at my oldest sister\u2019s bare legs that were now streaming with blood. Like I said, she was fearless. And, despite being my sister, a bit of a hero.\nAnd a hero she stayed, but of a different sort. She eventually married and settled down. And brought up two boys. I can\u2019t remember how old she was when she was diagnosed with schizophrenia but she wasn\u2019t much older than thirty. Despite the issues and symptoms brought on by her diagnosis, she managed to continue to raise her two children with her supportive husband, as well as dodging any hospital admissions.\nThen, a few years later, she was hit with a second diagnosis. Only this time it was cancer. And it brought her life to an early close. Her mental health issues had helped to mask some of her early symptoms, such as pain, preventing any early intervention. By the time the cancer was diagnosed it was too late and she was dead within the year.\nI have photo of her, sitting in my mother\u2019s garden, during a family barbecue. She looks thin and a little tired. She hair is a wig from the NHS. But she is smiling into the camera. When I look at the photo I imagine A Whiter Shade of Pale playing. It will always be her choice. Music that became a classic. Music that will always be cool. My sister heard it first. She always led the way. At least for me, being younger, she will always stay that way. Always the hero.\nIf you enjoyed this story and would like to read more, please click on the follow button and, also, sign for my weekly newsletter.\nIf you\u2019re thinking of subscribing to Medium at a mere fiver a month, giving you access to thousands of gifted writers, ranging over a huge variety of subjects, please support me by using this referral link.

You think you\u2019re a click away from those hot new pics of Keanu Reeves shirtless on the beach, but instead you end up being pitched crypto by some mummy wearing a bath towel. What the Internet has shown is that advertisers will do anything \u2014 lie, cheat, and definitely steal \u2014 to grab your attention. And no one has been more successful at snatching our attention \u2014 and then getting rich off it \u2014 than Meta and Google.\nAt their core Google and Meta are ad-agencies \u2014 middle-men to companies who want to sell you crap. Doubt it? Check the numbers: Google gets 80% of its revenue from selling ads; Meta, a whopping 99%. In other words, these companies aren\u2019t helping you find \u201cfriends\u201d or providing all-inclusive cloud platforms, but tricking you to buy stuff. They\u2019re 21st century Mad Men, sipping Soylent instead of scotch, and armed with tools of surveillance and manipulation that go far beyond even Don Draper\u2019s wildest dreams. And they\u2019re close to taking over the world.\nAs of 2021, 86% of the world\u2019s Internet searches went through Google. Meta\u2019s three apps \u2014 Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp \u2014 have 3.6 billion subscribers, or just over half of the world\u2019s population and growing. Last year, Google and Meta raked in 67% of online and 42% of total ad-dollars. In other words, almost half of the world\u2019s money used to persuade people to eat more naan, get a capoeira gym membership, or join a MLM went to just two companies. Two. All that ad-money pouring in has led to Google and Meta now being worth over $2 trillion dollars. For scale, that puts their market value somewhere between the GDP of Italy and France.\nGiven their size, it\u2019s a misnomer to call Google and Meta companies. Together, with Apple and Amazon, they are the engines of a post-industrial global economy whose raw material is not timber or steel, but your attention in the form of likes, posts, and searches. This economy has grown so huge, so essential to commerce, that its refined product \u2014 data \u2014 has dethroned oil to become the world\u2019s most valuable commodity. And the fuel that keeps this new attention economy humming along, the thing that turns all that data into dollars, is algorithmically targeted advertising.\nThat\u2019s right, every time you click on that ad for CBD dog treats in your Instagram stories you are throwing some coal in Facebook\u2019s furnace, doing your part to keep the wheels of industry turning. (And even if you don\u2019t click, well\u2026maybe someone, or something, will do it for you.)\nProgrammatic, algorithmically targeted advertising uses trillions of data points fed through artificial intelligence (AI) to create models of consumer behavior that predict how you will theoretically respond to a given ad. To get this data, to learn about \u201cyou,\u201d the consumer, companies like Google and Meta need to always stay one step ahead, to know what you want before you even do. It\u2019s what social psychologist Shoshana Zubuff calls \u201csurveillance capitalism,\u201d an economic system centered around the capture and commodification of personal data. In this brave new world, you aren\u2019t Big Tech\u2019s consumer, you\u2019re its product.\nThe basis of this economic system is the presupposed belief that digital advertising is more effective than just slapping a banner for Viagra on every sports gambling website. With the certainty of a medieval monk knowing how many angels can dance on the head of a pin, digital ad-savants claim a direct link between surveillance and advertising success \u2014 the more you know about a customer, the more you can manipulate their behavior, and therefore, increase sales.\nBut what if no one ever clicks on your ad for a new line of Sponge-Bob Square Pants lingerie or subscription-based dental floss start-up? What if the whole apparatus of surveillance and digital advertising \u2014 the financial structure that most of the Internet is built upon \u2014 is not as effective as everyone claims?\nWhat if no is paying really paying attention?\nTommy Chong says throw out your CBD and buy this data analytics start-up\nOver the last thirty years, companies like Google and Meta have sold investors on one thing: More snooping means more sales. But the results tell a different story. Google\u2019s own data shows that only .42% of Google ads are actually clicked on. In a recent study of 500-million-users, Facebook had overestimated its advertising impacts by 4000%.\nDespite massive market valuations, evidence shows demand just isn\u2019t there \u2014 most people simply ignore digital ads, no matter how micro-targeted they are. A 2019 study of Australian men ages 25 to 44 found that targeted advertising performed slightly worse than just random guessing. In other words, the whole system of targeted advertising is basically bunk.\nBut failure isn\u2019t always so bad. Instead of admitting defeat, Google, Meta, and other tech companies have doubled down on data harvesting. Because it\u2019s not that the ads aren\u2019t working, they just tell their investors \u201cwe need more data\u201d.\nIn other words, success \u2014 by these companies\u2019 own metrics \u2014 is not even possible. Instead, like Uber, WeWork, or other \u201cgrowth\u201d driven tech companies, digital advertising-based platforms are simply riding a colossal wave of speculative capital towards the ultimate goal of cornering their respective markets. As long as the money keeps pouring in, who cares if anyone actually clicks on those stupid ads?\nAnd that\u2019s just the demand side of the problem. On the supply side are the ad-markets, where companies bid for digital eyeballs on Facebook or YouTube in a highly complex, automated marketplace. These ad-auctions are the engine of the attention economy; the machine that refines personal data into a tradable asset. As pitched, they seamlessly match customers with products \u2014 your love of sea creatures with an ad for dolphin-free Bumble Bee-brand snack packs \u2014 by having advertisers buy ads that reach customers across websites or apps.\nBut like the financial markets they were originally modeled after, these secretive ad-auction markets are rife with fraud, wash trading, and rampant speculation. A 2014 study found that 57% of the ads purchased on Google were only \u201cseen\u201d by automated computer programs. Call it the wave of the future: \u201cads for androids\u201d.\nThe scary thing is not necessarily that digital advertising may be a scam \u2014 we\u2019re talking about an industry not exactly known for its honesty \u2014 but that so much of the Internet economy is funded by it. If you think the 2008 crash was bad, what till you see the Clickbait Collapse of 2027.\nBut to really understand how this all came to be, it\u2019s important to look at how Google, Meta and other tech companies define your data. Because the origin of their profits, and the quantum leap that turns your scrolls into a profile, personal data into an asset, begins with a relatively recent, and philosophically suspect, definition of attention.\nThis is what happens if you spend 22 hours per day on social media\nStand up!\nAttention \u2014 it\u2019s a precious thing. And to most, no mystery. You\u2019re giving this article it right now (well, maybe not). As the American philosopher William James said, \u201ceveryone knows what attention is.\u201d Or at least, maybe they did before the Internet reduced its average span to microseconds.\nActually, most modern psychologists have no idea what attention is, or believe the term is so vague as to be useless. But advertisers desperate to capture the hearts, minds, and pocketbooks of consumers have found their own ingenious ways to calculate attention. And it all kicked off with television.\nIn the late 1940\u2019s, the Nielson company developed the Audimeter, a device that would be installed in a family\u2019s television set and record a week\u2019s worth of programming on 16mm film. Randomly selected \u201cNielson families\u201d were enticed to add the Audimeter to their TV in exchange for free services and repair (a hot commodity in the age of clunky, vacuum tube TV technology). At the end of every week, \u201cTV Index\u201d servicemen would round up film from the \u201cblack boxes\u201d and deliver them to the Nielson company\u2019s headquarters in Evanston, Illinois. There, the results would be tabulated and released as the Nielsen Television Index \u2014 a weekly report on what was watched, and who, more importantly, was watching it. The Audimeter ensured that even if Cleveland or Tacoma were leveled in thermonuclear war, the survivors could still dig through the rubble and know who was watching \u201cHowdy Doody\u201d while the bombs were dropping.\nAs primitive as it may seem, the Audimeter revolutionized advertising. What was once speculative, now became enshrined in data (albeit based on a relatively limited sample size). If you knew the demographics, income, and spending habits of your average \u201cI Dream of Jeannie\u201d watcher, you could theoretically predict a whole range of consumer habits. You could sell targeted advertising spots \u2014 chocolate bars and dresses to housewives watching \u201cI Love Lucy\u201d \u2014 and in doing so, fund television programming.\nThe Nielson ratings were the foundation of the TV advertising world for over half a century, but were still a primitive way of tracking consumers. In 1987, the ratings systems were improved by the introduction of a new \u201cPeople\u2019s Meter,\u201d which transmitted information in real time back to Nelson via phone lines. It was another baby step towards a programmatic feedback-loop, but the real problem was with the medium itself: Television was fundamentally a passive medium, with little or no direct viewer interaction and limited ability to transmit more than just the most rudimentary information about television audiences. Counting eyeballs could only get you so far.\nWithout knowing who in a household was watching a program, targeted advertising was still mostly a guessing game. Instead of tailoring their ads to individuals, ad-men had to rely on brute projection, creating a fantasy world of limitless sex, power, and pleasure that was made to seem inseparable from reality. Their goal was not to mine, but to create desire. You needed to show the hapless drone slurping Hungry Man over episodes of Alf, that what they really wanted, more than life itself, was an all-beef patty or less filling light beer.\nThe goal was to create a user that matched your product; build a reality and convince your viewers that they lived in it. You had to show everyone that they could not survive without more volume-producing conditioner, sleeker higher and higher-FI stereo systems, and crunchier and crunchier potato chips. Advertising was a hammer, instead of a scalpel. And the ultimate goal was \u2014 to crib Noam Chomsky \u2014 to manufacture consent.\nHowever imperfect the Nielson ratings system was, it did one thing well: It quantified attention as a discrete thing \u2014 eyeballs to screens \u2014 which could then be turned into ad-dollars. But the rise of the Internet in the 90\u2019s destroyed the clunky Nielson system. With the digital era, attention became more than just a weekly rating, but the basis for a new global economy.\nThis one trick makes predictive algorithms go crazy\nWhereas television was fundamentally a one-dimensional, passive medium \u2014 you could only change the channel or turn it off \u2014 the Internet promised a whole new frontier of highly dynamic, real-time interaction. On any given website, there could be videos, essays, photos, chat spaces, games, ads, banners \u2014 a whole menagerie of interactive content to suck users in.\nAnd the financial potential was there. In the beginning, the \u201cinformation superhighway\u201d beckoned venture capitalists with rosy visions of limitless future profits. The problem was, for the first decade of the Internet\u2019s existence, nobody really knew how to make money off of it.\nBeginning in the early 90\u2019s, companies like AOL or Yahoo basically copied the old television formulas \u2014 throwing up ads matched to specific demographically targeted spaces in the hopes that someone would click on them. So, on CNN.com you\u2019d see a banner for Rogaine and on MTV.com you\u2019d get an ad for Mountain Dew; it was a simple, relatively easy way to fund a website. Anyone could toss some corporate banner on their website, get a few ad-bucks in return, and call it good.\nAll that changed with Google\u2019s release of AdWords, Google\u2019s digital advertising marketplace, in 2003.\nIn 2002, Google co-founder Larry Page was looking for a way to replace old-fashioned advertising sales teams with more efficient, software-driven systems. He hired Hal Varian, an economist, to develop an AI backed ad-auction program modeled after financial markets. On AdWords, companies would bid for advertising and then automated algorithms would match their ad to a targeted consumer base. When a company bought ad-space through AdWords, they would not know exactly where, when, or even if their ad would be shown. They had to trust AdWords, and assume that Google\u2019s algorithms were effectively targeting their proposed demographics. It was an efficient, powerful solution to both advertise and fund websites on a large scale. Unfortunately, basing advertising on algorithms required some significant trade-offs.\nFirst, AdWords needed a way to define attention, not as some floaty psychological concept, but as discrete action that could be translated into data. This data would then be used to create specific consumer demographics, creating a neat feedback loop that \u2014 as information accumulated \u2014 could grow ever more sophisticated targeting. Suddenly, attention became a commodity, a raw material made up of clicks, hovers, and scrolls that, once refined through the sale of target advertising, could be priced and sold. There was no need to pull black boxes, or tap phone lines; your customers\u2019 attention was being tapped and sold to the highest bidder. It was this quantification of attention \u2014 from something that everyone somehow \u201cknows\u201d but can\u2019t really pin down, into a quantifiable object and finally into discrete, marketable assets \u2014 that marked the beginning of the modern Internet economy.\nInstead of waiting to dig through a stack of Nielson family reels, or guessing why Rogaine sales suddenly dropped after Golden Girls was canceled, Procter and Gamble or Rupert Murdoch could now theoretically see \u2014 in real-time \u2014 how effective their ads were. With this ability to micro-target customers, companies became more willing to pay for Internet advertising space, funneling more and more money in the early 00\u2019s into Google and other start-ups.\nAnd it seemed like a win-win for everyone. The public got \u201cfree\u201d services like GoogleDocs and Facebook (founded in 2006); Silicon Valley got flooded with venture capital. And those that didn\u2019t adapt \u2014 AOL and other subscription-based services \u2014 disappeared into the trash heap of history.\nBut eyeballs on screens weren\u2019t enough. Like Victorian taxonomists, digital advertising demanded an endless collection of data and parceling of individuals into narrower and narrower groups. Each click needed to bring you, the user, that much closer to the perfect age, gender, ethnicity, sexual preference, and income level based hand lotion. Companies had to find more ingenious, and invasive, ways of turning your information into cash.\nTo do that, first you need constant engagement. The fact that social media platforms are designed to mimic casinos isn\u2019t a quirk; they\u2019re a feature of a system that needs to constantly suck at your attention, drawing as much information as possible to feed your consumer profile.\nTake your typical lunch-break Instagram scroll. While you check out footage of Swiss supermodels wearing the hottest new designer jorts, Zuckerberg\u2019s algorithms (cookies) are collecting your every scroll, pause, click, comment, and like. Each of these pings a signal, a little drip of attention that pools into a profile. Then, in the microseconds before you leave those jort pics to click on your favorite Whalestep song, software crunches that data to search for patterns. What these patterns reveal is a profile of \u201cyou\u201d that it then uses to auction micro-targeted ad-spaces.\nWe\u2019ve all seen the results. One minute you \u201clike\u201d a Facebook post about your friends\u2019 favorite ice cream, the next you\u2019re seeing ads for plus-size jeans. With a few eerie exceptions, it all happens so seamlessly, so invisibly, that most users accept, or are even unaware, of the implied trade-off. I get free, unlimited access to all the hottest Grogu memes on Facebook, and Mark Zuckerberg gets to show me a few ads. Seems pretty fair, right?\nAnd that\u2019s the pitch not only to you, but to the companies buying ad-space. They are paying for results \u2014 clicks, purchases, site traffic. If that means Facebook tracks sensitive personal information like your menstrual cycle, or gives your voting history to shady political actors, at the end of the day it\u2019s all just ones and zeros, right? Because, you aren\u2019t Meta\u2019s customer, you\u2019re the product. And how can a product have rights?\nTech companies reinforce you as the product, rather than consumer, by discussing their platforms as \u201cdata collection\u201d or \u201cdata mining.\u201d It\u2019s clever PR, a way to subtly flatten all information \u2014 no matter how personal \u2014 into just another resource, like iron, oil, or wheat.\nBut these sneaky terms hide deeper ideological motives. Data mining implies that once personal information is harvested \u2014 for instance, if Facebook learns about your sexual preferences by snooping on your scrolling history \u2014 it is rightfully, and permanently, owned by the company whose platform you are using. We don\u2019t own our deepest secrets because they can be measured on a quarterly report, or be used as another financial asset. Defining data as a resource, rather than a right, reinforces the belief that any reduction in its collection \u2014 such as reducing the surveillance capacity \u2014 is treated by companies like Meta as an existential threat.\nIn other words, terms like data mining conveniently obfuscate the true goal of surveillance-based digital advertising, and the attention economy it funds: to redefine individuals entirely within a technological, rather than political framework and in doing so, eventually commodify every aspect of their existence.\nThe fact is, when you scroll on Facebook, you are not being mined for data, but milked. Every time you click on your friends\u2019 funny otter post, or clap back to your right-wing uncle about wearing a mask at the Starbucks drive-thru, ol\u2019 Zuckerberg* is grabbing hold of your digital identity and taking a little squeeze \u2014 a few drops of data into a pail. That data is then collected, click after click, rant by rant, and processed by specialized machines \u2014 patented algorithms \u2014 into a wide variety of from your sweet dairy teat which are then sold at auction to distributors.\nIt\u2019s through these auctions that Google, Meta, Twitter, TikTok and other advertising-based tech companies provide the liquidity for the modern Internet, undergirding the global attention economy that \u2014 at least on its surface \u2014 appears unstoppable.\nBut when you base an entire economic system on how many times someone clicks on gluten-free, cruelty-free condoms or shares a Grumpy Cat-Travis Scott mashup video, it\u2019s worth asking: who cares?\nOr, more importantly: who or what is buying all those ads?\nThese three things all cheaters and financial bubbles have in common\nWith automated ad-marketplaces, vendors like Google or Meta sell ad inventory to a pool of bidders in real-time. On the supply-side, buyers bid on the market they are trying to hit. They enter how much they are willing to pay, who they want to target, and how often they want to show their ads. On the demand-side, sellers set prices, rules for what advertiser eligibility, and other company-specific parameters.\nAll it takes is one \u2014 click! In microseconds, the ad-auctions seamlessly turn a customer\u2019s search for \u201chottest taquito joint in Dallas\u201d into a banner for your Brooklyn-based bluetooth-enabled yoga mats. It\u2019s efficient, sophisticated, and widely successful. Or at least, that\u2019s what everyone is meant to believe.\nIn reality, ad agencies and Big Tech have found plenty of ways to scam buyers out of their dollars, inflate ad-prices, and pump the digital advertising market to bubble-like levels.\nBecause online ad-auctions are so complex, most companies looking to market online outsource their bids to highly specialized intermediaries. These ad agencies act as brokers, helping \u2014 in theory \u2014 to get the best bids on the most effective ad-spaces. But often they engage in financial arbitrage, buying advertising space and then marking it up to their customers to artificially inflate the value of their ads. A 2020 study found that half of all online ad-spending went to such middle-men and that almost a third of the money spent on placing ads is completely untraceable.\nBut you wouldn\u2019t know that if you were just buying a banner or two for your Puppy Rescue App on Instagram. In fact, you might look at the numbers \u2014 the boon of digital advertising is all that data, and it can show you exactly how many clicks or eyeballs your ads are getting \u2014 and see real product engagement. But behind the scenes, shady companies hire \u201cclick farms\u201d of automated bots or low-paid humans to falsely pump ad engagement or use \u201cdomain spoofing\u201d to make ad-inventory falsely look like it\u2019s on a high traffic site. And you might have never had a chance to access the good ad-space. Online platforms give select buyers access to dark pools, or private marketplaces, where they can bid on the highest quality, least competitive ads. What all this does is inflate the value of targeted digital ads far beyond their actual value; you think you\u2019re paying for a Times Square billboard, and really all you\u2019re getting is a hobo holding a cardboard sign.\nThe scary thing is that all this waste and fraud doesn\u2019t really matter. As long as money keeps pumping into it, and no one cares whether the thing works or not, the attention economy will grow and grow.\nThe top seven ways to rule the metaverse\nTech companies that rely on digital advertising are facing an existential crisis. They know, but can\u2019t admit, that ads built on mountains of personal data are still no better than click-bait. But they still need to promise their investors something more: more users, or more clicks. More users means more addictive engagement; more clicks means more surveillance. We know, for a fact, how either option destroy democracies or concentrate power into unaccountable intelligence agencies.\nThe Metaverse is a delusional attempt to escape the limits of this economic model. It shows there\u2019s nothing left to do but stick everyone in a veal crate with a VR helmet strapped to their head, milk them for every quanta of attention possible, to save the system from collapse.\nTwenty years later, we know that digital advertising is mostly built on rainbows, unicorns, and a mountain of fraud. The fact is, targeted digital advertising will persist because it provides the liquidity to keep digital economies solvent, and acts as the backbone of a global surveillance system. It\u2019s not going away. So how do we control it? Regulate ad-markets through the SEC, break up Big Tech, nationalize Google and Meta, replace Zuckerberg with a genetic clone of Grumpy Cat as Meta\u2019s CEO \u2014 there\u2019s plenty of options on the table, if only we, as a society, decide to actually start paying attention.\n* It is literally Zuckerberg since he owns a commanding 51% stake in Meta.", "comment_count": 2, "like_count": 156, "created_time": 1647485806568, "comment": [{"user_id": "883b17abec2b", "comment_time": 1647485806568, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "365ef2fd6fe6", "comment_time": 1648988828397, "comment": "Excellent story.

Luther was vicious, thorough, and attacked just about every aspect of Roman Catholic doctrine. He hated the new taxes anytime a new bishop was elected, the absurd yearly mass for the dead, the endless pilgrimages. But he saved special venom for indulgences.\nThe indulgences were medieval pay-to-play, a way for the naughty to offset their peccadillos with a payment to the church. Covet your neighbor\u2019s wife? Eat too many eel pies on Easter Sunday? Give a bag of silver or gold to your local bishop and you too could still walk through those pearly gates. For Luther it was a step too far \u2014 a greedy, cynical ploy by the Church that implied humans could haggle with God. It was widely hated, and when someone finally had the gall \u2014 or stupidity \u2014 to complain about it, people listened. Including, of course, the authorities.\nIn 1521, Luther was called by the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V to recant at a formal papal assembly, or \u201cDiet,\u201d in the city of Worms. Luther was a small-time friar, used to woolen frocks and mutton sausages, untrained in the pomp and majesty of the court. But though he may have looked modest, Luther had a powerful weapon on his side \u2014 popularity.\nIn the four years since Wittenburg, Luther had been a content machine, publishing almost 25 books, pamphlets, and religious tracts. His words made him a folk hero, the voice of a new religious movement that dared to defy the Catholic church. He had taken the printing press and weaponized it. And the threat this new technology posed to the iron grip of the Church was immense.\nFor almost a thousand years the Catholic Church had been the center of medieval religious, economic, and social life, a kind of supramanager of the feudal order. It maintained that order through a vast set of rituals \u2014 attending Latin mass, making a pilgrimage to the bones of a saint \u2014 that publicly affirmed the power of the Church. God lived \u2014 quite literally in the eucharist \u2014 in the social body.\nBut since the 14th century, major changes had destabilized the feudal order and the legitimacy of the church. The first major blow came with the arrival of the Black Death in 1349. By killing off half the population of Europe, the plague increased the supply of free land and decreased the supply of laborers, giving them both freedom from \u2014 and bargaining power over \u2014 their feudal lords. Feudal lords\u2019 power further diminished with the discovery of New World markets in the 15th century. Financing expeditions, processing raw materials, and managing credit systems all necessitated an increasingly sophisticated economic system that shifted power away from rural aristocratic lords towards a market economy run by a burgeoning, urban middle class. And then came the printing press.\nInvented in 1440 by Johannes Gutenberg, a German goldsmith, the printing press was the key technology of the early modern era. During the middle ages, books were hand copied, slow to produce, and prohibitively expensive. Gutenberg\u2019s invention made written material cheap and relatively quick to mass produce. Although literacy was still low, the ability to rapidly spread new ideas through space and time was massively destabilizing to the Church\u2019s thousand-year monopoly on the truth. If the Bible was the Word of God, and I have a copy, then what are the priests for? The revolution was already there, in any banker, journeymen, or cobbler\u2019s hands; all Luther did was articulate it.\nIn this way, the printing press did more than increase access to information, but radically changed the way medieval people imagined the world. There was no need for incense, Hail Marys, or magic spells; God was an idea, whose will could be divined privately by decoding his Words in a book. There was no need for priests or bishops; God\u2019s truth was right there, waiting to be read. The printing press manifested its own theology. The old medieval world \u2014 where Heaven and Earth were unified in the Great Chain of Being \u2014 was suddenly split into new, opposing spheres: Church and State, public and private, body and mind.\nBy nailing up his 95 Theses, Luther was the first to fully publicize this revolutionary shift. And now, at the Diet of Worms, it was time to defend his ideas \u2014 and his life \u2014 before some of the most powerful men on the continent.\nAt the assembly, Luther summed up this movement in two phrases: sola fide, sola scriptura \u2014 by faith and the Word alone. The Bible, not the Church, was the only source of truth and legitimacy. This made all the Church\u2019s intermediaries \u2014 popes, priests, monks \u2014 redundant. Then Luther took it a step further. He claimed (correctly) that the Church\u2019s most sacred rituals \u2014 the eucharist, infant baptism, the cult of the saints \u2014 were pure inventions, with no evidence in scripture. It was all a puppet show used to keep bishops fat off the toil of serfs. To Luther, salvation was a private affair between God and an individual; no matter how much they paid for an indulgence, only God could forgive sins. He asked the court to find anything in the Bible that could refute his claims, a passage that showed that God required them \u2014 the well-fed, silken robed papal authorities seated before him \u2014 or their rituals. It didn\u2019t go over well.\nThe Diet quickly came to a decision. Luther was excommunicated from the Church \u2014 canceled, you might say \u2014 and told he could safely return home. But it was obvious that Luther was a marked man. He was too popular, too outspoken to be allowed to freely roam \u2014 or publish \u2014 in Germany. Before long, Luther would be arrested, sentenced, and executed for heresy. Thankfully, a sympathetic patron, the Elector of Saxony, Prince Fredrick III, staged a mock kidnapping in the woods outside of Worms and brought Luther back to his castle in Wartburg. Luther, probably without even knowing it, was saved from his own martyrdom.\nFor the next two decades, Luther lived the life of a comfortable Influencer \u2014 writing full time and growing fat on ale and gravy-soaked roasts. In 1534, he produced his crowning achievement, the first German translation of the Bible. Now, any Bohemian cobbler or journeyman had unfiltered access to the Word of God.\nOver the next century, the movement that Luther defined \u2014 Protestantism, after the Latin protestari, \u201cto publicly testify\u201d \u2014 quickly spread across Europe. And it was more than a religious movement; it was a fundamental restructuring of Western society where the individual would be the center of the State.\nWhat came next, so the story goes, was the scientific revolution, the Enlightenment, modernity. This eventually culminated in the triumph of the secular, scientifically rational world we live in today. And it all started with Luther, a lone hero whose dogged pursuit of truth, and challenge of the status quo, changed the course of history. Or maybe with the printing press \u2014 that singular technology that broke the intellectual stranglehold of the Catholic Church and helped birth an individualized and abstracted subjectivity. Take your pick; or better yet, combine the two. Because the story of Luther and the printing press is being told everywhere \u2014 on the pages of Wired and The New York Times, on Reddit forums and from TikTok influencers, in Apple ads and tweets from billionaire-entrepreneurs.\nIt\u2019s the story of messianic, techno-solutionism, the belief that advances in science and technology are inherently progressive; that history is not a struggle of social, economic, or environmental forces, but the inevitable triumph of better and better ideas (discovered and then propagated by some charismatic genius). Luther\u2019s story still holds such sway because it is the genesis of this myth, the symbolic moment we stole fire from the gods. Techno-solutionism has become so ingrained, so necessary as a part of our cultural mythos that to deny it \u2014 even when the invention is digital-junk being touted by hucksters looking to make a quick buck \u2014 is to challenge a worldview that is as fervently, and irrationally, believed in as the dogma of the medieval Church of Rome.\nFive hundred years from the Diet of Worms, we are told we are on the cusp of another revolution. One that promises to eliminate our dependence on the State once for all, to create a utopia where everyone is their own master. It\u2019s a story where everyone is getting hilariously rich, where unicorns drive Lamborghinis (\u201clambos\u201d) to the moon and an ex-Hollywood child actor creates a $100 billion dollar currency. A journey into the future where everything is transmuted into software \u2014 the State, money, art, your identity.\nBehold, the blockchain.\n2008 \u2014 the year of the global financial crisis \u2014 was a good year to start a religion.\nA decade of cheap credit and a lax regulatory environment had turned the American economy into one giant casino. When the bookie finally came knocking, and no one could pay, central banks like the Federal Reserve conjured trillions of dollars out of thin air, and then promptly gave it back to the same self-dealing, corrupt bankers who had engineered the scam. Most of the public was too shocked or confused to know better. \u201cQuantitative easing,\u201d \u201cmortgage-backed derivatives\u201d \u2014 these \u201csolutions\u201d were as arcane and incomprehensible as a medieval Latin mass. But the message was clear: Money was magic, and only we \u2014 the high priests of finance \u2014 know the spells.\nThat year, a mysterious coder named Satoshi Nakamoto proposed an alternative: a digital currency built on a decentralized system that was anonymous, hack-proof, and inflation-proof. There would be no central bank \u2014 new coins would be \u201cmined\u201d by computers solving complex math problems and then added to a cryptographically secure chain of code. The currency would provide a way for anyone in the world to exchange value free of the oversight of their government. One year later, Nakamoto released the proof of concept \u2014 Bitcoin, the world\u2019s first cryptocurrency.\nUnlike Luther, Satoshi\u2019s theses weren\u2019t nailed to a bank\u2019s door, but published in a white paper on an obscure cryptography mailing list, disguised in jargon and mathematics that were only decipherable to the coder-Elect. Soon, a legion of digital apostles formed to follow in Satoshi\u2019s footsteps, creating their own alternative currencies \u2014 or alt-coins \u2014 and get fabulously, stupidly rich off of them.\nIn 2015, a teenager named Vitalik Buterin developed Ethereum, an open-source rival to Bitcoin. (He\u2019s now worth $1.5 billion.) In 2017, Bitcoin\u2019s price soared almost 10,000%, from $900 to $20,000. In 2018, the ex-Mighty Ducks star Pierce Brock co-founded Tether, a \u201cstablecoin\u201d with a $100 billion dollar market cap. It was alchemy, code became cash, Priuses transmuted into lambos. Prices were going to the moon, and no idea became too stupid to make a buck off.\nA banana company in Laos created Bannancoin, pegged to the price of one kilo of Lady Fingers. Then there\u2019s Dentacoin, a dentistry token that at one point had a market value of $2 billion. Dogecoin, with a cute little icon of a Shibu Inu as its mascot, started out as a joke \u2014 a memecoin. But after tech prophet Elon Musk tweeted about it, its value skyrocketed. Its current market cap: $18 billion dollars. Clearly, the ability to create billions out of nothing was the sign of a new era. Tether\u2019s other founder put it bluntly: \u201cThis is the first time in human history anyone other than kings or governments or gods can create their own money.\u201d King Solomon was minting his own mines.\nBut, for the true believers the real promise in Satoshi\u2019s paper wasn\u2019t godlike wealth but the blockchain, the system of decentralized, distributed ledgers that Bitcoin is built upon. To put it (not that) simply, the blockchain is a massively shared, simultaneously accessed spreadsheet visible to everyone, but alterable only when certain conditions are met. Blockchain would fulfill the original promise of the Internet, as a free and open system that would disperse power rather than centralize it.\nThe current Internet is a distributed system, where information is stored on servers that are accessed through a central router. This centralization has a lot of benefits \u2014 it\u2019s simple, stable, and resilient \u2014 but there\u2019s one major catch. Anyone who has control over this system has an incredible amount of power. Malicious state or corporate actors can shut down key routers to silence protests, hide bad PR, or even cripple whole economies. The Internet, as it was originally designed, favors the accumulation of power. Which is one reason why four companies \u2014 Facebook, Google, Apple, and Amazon \u2014 completely dominate it.\nIn contrast, the blockchain is a decentralized system, built on peer-to-peer connections. Control is diffused, independent of direct state or corporate control. In a global blockchain system there would be no central node to control, no server farm to take over, just a Great Blockchain of Being \u2014 billions of individuals connected through a web of code. To its true believers, blockchain could redefine property rights, legal systems, and the very idea of a State for the 21st century.\nAnything that is added to the blockchain stays there \u2014 a digital version of Moses\u2019 golden tablets. Through the use of NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, individuals could store virtual property or inscribe their own names on this tablet \u2014 own their digital identity and decide how it would be shared, reproduced, or monetized. NFTs could be used to create a new kind of property that would be legitimized by code, rather than state authority. When combined with smart contracts \u2014 basically self-executing algorithms \u2014 the possibilities are, to the crypto faithful at least, endless.\nSmart contracts are a way to enforce the terms of an agreement without a middleman. With one swoop, you could replace lawyers, notaries, and bureaucrats with software. Instead of agonizing wait times at the DMV, your Bitcoin linked account could automatically pay \u2014 and guarantee the legitimacy of \u2014 your yearly registration. But, in theory, you could program these smart contracts to do anything \u2014 to replace legal systems, citizenship, even the State. A few brave crypto pioneers have already plunged into the wilderness to try just that.\nIn 2021, Wyoming approved the creation of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO) \u2014 blockchain-based entities in which members use crypto-tokens to vote on actions. That year, a group of investors banded together to purchase 100 acres of sagebrush steppe in central Wyoming. (Showing the creative power of consensus, they named it CityDAO.) In the spirit of liberty and freedom, citizenship is open to all. For .25 Ether \u2014 about $1000 \u2014 you can buy \u201cbasic\u201d citizenship to CityDAO, which includes access to a Discord, voting rights, and the option to settle land (after the first \u201cfounding citizens,\u201d of course). No word yet on when the next tier of citizenship will be released.\nTo its boosters, CityDAO is proof that blockchain and crypto can transform the world. If a group of strangers can create a country in the middle of the Wyoming wasteland, then anything is possible! Puff that idea up to a global scale and you have the next stage of social evolution \u2014 Web 3.0 \u2014 a global blockchain-based state that gets rid of all the rigid authority, messy politicking, and gross inefficiency of a human-run government.\nAs of 2022, CityDAO is still out there, building Eden in a sea of tumbleweeds. But that\u2019s not to say it, and the entire cryptocurrency industry, hasn\u2019t had its share of growing pains. In mid-January 2022 a hacker gained control of the CityDAO\u2019s admin account and stole 26.67 ETH (about $95,000). The same week that CityDAO was duped, hackers stole $30 million from Crypto.com. In 2021 alone, over $21 billion was stolen from cryptocurrency exchanges. It\u2019s a pirate economy built by, and for, thieves.\n13 years after Satoshi\u2019s paper the only thing that cryptocurrencies have proven useful for is money laundering, tax evasion, outright scams, and most importantly, financial speculation. You can\u2019t buy a house, or even a pizza, with Bitcoin. (Or, why would you want to if the price could change by 10% in ten minutes?) Ultimately, cryptocurrencies are not currencies, but speculative assets: stocks that have no dividends, post no earnings, and are ultimately worth exactly zero dollars.\nAnd then there are the environmental costs, usually downplayed by crypto-boosters. Bitcoin mining alone uses 91 terawatt-hours of electricity yearly. That\u2019s more electricity than Sweden, 91 times more energy than Google, and .5% of energy consumption worldwide. And that\u2019s all without providing anything as delicious as a kottbullar, or as ergonomic as a Gursken.\nWhat Bitcoin shows is the widespread disbelief that technology can fail; that innovation and adoption (or usefulness) are two different things. Instead of the techno revolution promised in Satoshi\u2019s white paper, we have a giant carbon-spewing, Ponzi-scheme whose main innovation is to promote the sound investment advice of \u201cbuy low, sell high\u201d.\nDespite all the obvious economic, environmental, and social hazards involved with crypto, there\u2019s got to be something to it. I mean, everyone is getting in on it \u2014 influencers, celebrities, probably your nephews. And why not? As long as the line keeps going up, we\u2019re all going to get rich? And you want to be rich, don\u2019t you?\nAnd what about the blockchain? Surely, given all the hype there\u2019s bound to be something useful there? Who wouldn\u2019t want a digital vending machine that sells titles, wills, or citizenship instead of Snickers bars, or be able to make a few cents from NFT-minted digital identity every time Facebook sells your info to marketers?\nUnfortunately, the same qualities that make blockchain appealing \u2014 its decentralization, security, immutability \u2014 also make it incredibly slow, wasteful, and devoid of any privacy or consumer protections. The fact is, anything that you can do on blockchain can be better done on a centralized server. As blockchain skeptics have attested, it\u2019s a solution looking for a problem.\nBut even if no one uses Shibu Inu coin, or gets their Excitable Slug NFT marketplace off the ground, it doesn\u2019t mean that the impacts of these new speculative assets won\u2019t be far-reaching. There is now $3 trillion dollars invested in cryptocurrency, tied, more than ever, with larger markets through publicly traded companies like Coinbase, ETFs, and soon even your 401k. And like the mortgage-back derivatives of the early 00\u2019s, the more these totally unregulated, fraud-ridden assets infiltrate the financial system the more unstable it will become. What started as a critique of the financial crash, will probably soon repeat it.\nBut, the push for a technology that (so far) obviously fails to deliver on any of its promises portends something deeper than just cheap populism. Crypto and blockchain are appealing to venture-capitalist vampires like Peter Thiel or McKinsey & Company because they are another step towards a digitized, financialized future where everything and everyone can be bought in the market. An anarcho-libertarians' utopia where there are no gods, no masters, only the Market. Sola coda, sola blockchain.\nThis paradise is sold as the only means of escape from the increasingly dreary, hopeless future that most young people find themselves in. Would you rather retire early after betting it all on Shibu Inu coin or slave away for the foreseeable future as an Instacart serf? And like most utopian projects \u2014 whose eminence is always just around the corner \u2014 faith fills in the meantime. It doesn\u2019t matter what blockchain can do, but what you believe it will do. It doesn\u2019t matter that most cryptocurrencies are clearly scams, only that they will \u2014 as long as that line goes up \u2014 free you from your shitty job.\nWhat the rise of crypto really shows is the failure of any social or political movements to provide a meaningful answer to the post-2008 financial crisis. Instead of instituting new democratic controls on the market, we turned our rage at the financial system into a speculative commodity. If that\u2019s not what makes America great, what does?\nWhat this desperate need for social mobility at any cost fuels is techno-fetishism pumped to new religious heights. Because the technologies are so clearly useless, all we\u2019re left with is the empty, irrational belief that messianic geniuses and magical technologies can save us from our political, social, and environmental ills. (And get us all rich doing so, of course.) And this belief is backed by the same basic myth of the printing press, rewritten to the digital age: where new technologies, and the social changes they produce, are seen as teleological. Basically, God\u2019s will.\nUnfortunately, the origin story of the printing press \u2014 the Ur-myth about the socially transformative power of technology\u2014 falls apart after a cursory glance at its history.\nThe first use of moveable type technology \u2014 the basis for the printing press \u2014 was invented 150 years before Gutenberg by a Korean minister named Choe Yun-In. Although Yun-In\u2019s press produced a few religious works, it ultimately failed to have any immediate, long-term impact in East Asia. Even in Europe, the adoption of printing technology was fairly slow. For the first hundred years after Gutenberg\u2019s invention in 1450, books were still mainly a hobby for the upper classes, a luxury item used to gain prestige, a way to continue the scholarly religious debates of the middle ages, or even used as loan collateral.\nIn short, technologies are always a product of, and used within, a social order. The printing press was not some overnight revelation, but was slowly adopted and expanded over a period of hundreds of years. What accelerated its expansion in the early 16th century were changing social, economic, and environmental conditions. Luther\u2019s 95 Theses spread so quickly because they landed in the fertile ground of medieval Catholic Europe. A thousand-year order was being undermined by the growth of market-based economies, rising competition between proto-Capitalist states, and the failure of a feudal agricultural system to deal with the colder climate of the Little Ice Age. But the Reformation didn\u2019t happen overnight. Luther\u2019s ideas had been building for centuries before they finally reached a critical mass. It was then through the spread of the written word that they metastasized \u2014 and eventually helped destroy \u2014 the feudal order.\nIn contrast, the fact that crypto and blockchain has exploded so rapidly onto the market shows that this isn\u2019t a real social or technological movement, but a religious one.\nWhat we\u2019re witnessing is a grift disguised as a revival. At the forefront are pump-and-dump preachers hawking junk technologies whose rapid, zealous adoption only shows their speculative superficiality. What they created with cryptocurrencies is a new casino for desperate people to gamble their savings away as a way to escape the misery of their own lives. And it doesn\u2019t matter how much money is lost, stolen, or scammed, as long as the fantasy is maintained: a techno-heaven where nobody works and everybody gets rich. And who wouldn\u2019t want to step through those pearly gates?

And it is time to show whose side you are on: Are you Woke or are you a Warrior?\nA year ago, hundreds of brave men and women stormed our Nation\u2019s Capital. Without firing a shot, they nearly toppled the world\u2019s oldest liberal democracy, the world\u2019s largest and most sophisticated military, and history\u2019s most comprehensive and sophisticated surveillance apparatus. And they did it in style.\nWho could forget the QAnon shaman, clad in those fine furs and horned helmet, bellowing from the speaker\u2019s chair? Or, that American flag-caped superman clawing his way up the Capital\u2019s walls?\nAnd then there were the fashions. Through every busted barricade, patriots streamed through in the latest tactical wear \u2014 matte-black Kevlar vests, digi-camo Oakleys, concealed-carry relaxed-fit blue jeans. They sullied the halls of State in the hottest right-wing brands \u2014 1776 t-shirts, WWG1WGA hoodies, Black Rifle Coffee ball caps. If you\u2019re gonna fight tyranny, you\u2019ve got to show it; you\u2019ve got to own it.\nSome may claim that it was the criminal incompetence of federal and local law enforcement that allowed a mob of downwardly mobile incels and aging diabetics to breach the Capitol\u2019s defenses. But I\u2019m here to tell you the truth, so that you will choose the path of the true patriot.\nJanuary 6th was a coordinated attack. And there was nothing any of us could do to stop it.\nThe coordination came from people trained by decades of mass media and consumerism to imitate the spectacle of war that had infiltrated every aspect of American society. Everything they had been told on TV, bought online, or read on Facebook had built them up to that day, to equate the performance of revolution with revolution itself. The question is: are you ready to join them? Are you ready to leave the Sheep and become a Wolf?\nSince 9/11, America has been mobilizing for war.\nFirst, there was the traditional military mobilization. Hours after the attacks on the Pentagon and the Twin Towers, B-52s filled the skies over Central Asia; a half dozen aircraft carriers rolled into the Persian Gulf. Overnight, we were at war with Terror, an abstraction whose definition could be stretched to fit almost anyone or anything, and yet quickly encompassed a specific ethnicity, or region, with economically crucial resources that resisted American hegemony. It was the beginning of a global, neocolonial war of occupation with no clear objectives and no end in sight.\nA small fraction of the American citizenry \u2014 majority white and high-school educated \u2014 were shipped out of the country to fight this new war. Some did so out of anger or patriotism; others because they signed a few papers at the local recruiting center at the wrong time. Many of them spent the next two decades abroad, getting shot at, bombed, or traumatized fighting unwinnable guerrilla wars.\nOn the home front, the collapse of the Twin Towers showed Americans that the enemy could strike anywhere, and really, everywhere. And if people didn\u2019t get the message \u2014 that they could be a target, too \u2014 there were other ways to instill fear. The next envelope you open could be sprinkled with anthrax, compliments of the US Army labs at Fort Detrick. If you can\u2019t trust the US mail, who can you trust?\nTo manage this new state of eternal paranoia, quickly Congress passed the Patriot Act; and within a year, the Homeland Security Act. Both dramatically changed the definitions of privacy, security, and citizenship. Say the wrong thing to a cop, or lose your passport at the airport, and you too could become a non-citizen, an enemy of the state.\nMost Americans \u2014 still in a state of shock \u2014 accepted this massive expansion in state power. What else could they do? In the first few days after 9/11, people were terrified to leave their homes, open their mailboxes, or take that weekly trip to the mall. But so much unharnessed anxiety was bad for business.\nIn a televised address on the night of 9/11, President Bush assured the people that our \u201cfinancial institutions remain strong\u201d and that America was still \u201copen for business.\u201d A few days later, Dick Cheney went on Meet the Press to offer solace to angry and fearful Americans. The best way to \u201cstick their thumb in the eye of the terrorists,\u201d Cheney said, was to not let the tragedy of 9/11 \u201cin any way throw off their normal level of activity.\u201d In contrast to WWII, no one was being asked to ration steel, build victory gardens, or sacrifice for the common good. The only reason anyone was going to roll up their sleeves was to get a new tribal tattoo.\nIt was consumer patriotism, tailored to a post-industrial, financialized economy. Buy that new SUV, take that trip to Disney World \u2014 the only thing terrorists hated more than our freedoms were our credit cards. And Corporate America was happy to join the fight.\nSoon, the shelves were stocked with American flag beer cans, star-studded Freedom diapers, Liberty brand pillows, and defiant Beanie Babies named \u201cAmerica\u201d and \u201cCourage.\u201d Even high-end goods got in on the game. Neiman Marcus stocked $750 American flag Manolo Blahnik pumps. Lady Roi Bridals created a line of \u201cAmerican Girl\u201d themed red, white and blue wedding dresses. Price tag: $1000 a pop. It\u2019s times like these you learn to spend again.\nThen, barely two months after 9/11, a powerful moment of national catharsis took place: the Budweiser Clydesdales kneeled for the flag in a Super Bowl commercial.\nWhat 9/11 showed is the ease in which corporate America took the Nation\u2019s trauma and cynically re-packaged it into a product whose purchase could absolve collective guilt and soothe individual anxieties. And best of all, no one had to pay for it because it was all financed on debt. Why fight the war when you could just buy it?\nThis connection between hyper-nationalism and hyper-consumerism threw rocket fuel on a process that was decades in the making. Consumption always had a performative element \u2014 keeping up with the Joneses was nothing new \u2014 but the War on Terror transmuted buying useless crap at the mall into an overtly political act, a form of social currency that only grew in value the more it distanced itself from the real thing.\nBest of all, the whole thing was a win-win for capital, a way to profit on all aspects of war, from building Predator drones to selling pro-Troop chicken sandwiches. And it came at just the right time. The post Dot-com crash had left shareholders scrambling for profit; now the boom was back, fully funded by U.S. military spending and the global circulation of the petrodollar.\nLike rest of the American economy, the externalities of the War on Terror were purposefully made invisible \u2014 whole villages were being evaporated by cluster bombs in Central Asia, but those were just numbers that scrolled across a chyron on some 24-hour news show. Bono was singing about peace and love at the Super Bowl; everything was gonna be alright.\nBut outsourcing the violence of war, and equating fighting a war with the mere performance of it, had long term side effects that few could predict.\nSince the 70\u2019s, American companies had been moving steel, manufacturing, and automotive production to cheaper labor markets around the world. As a result, when 9/11 happened, there were few factories to fire up, and little stock to gain doing so. We no longer built stuff, we bought it.\nBut the outsourcing didn\u2019t stop at the factory. Half of the $14 trillion dollars the US government eventually spent in the War on Terror went to private defense contractors. A good chunk of that money ended up pumping the stocks of companies like Blackwater, who sold for-profit mercenaries with dubious legal status to replace traditional citizen-soldiers.\nAs a result, the War on Terror didn\u2019t need the draft (or have to manage its socially destabilizing effects). Instead, the war would be won through an expansive national security state guiding a technologically advanced occupying force supported, on the home front, by mass consumer mobilization. It was fool proof, a known known.\nSo, for most Americans, the war was something that happened on TV; a spectacle that was especially unreal because, unlike Vietnam, coverage of the war by the news media was carefully censored to avoid showing the true cost of war \u2014 gangs of amputee children, caskets filled with dead soldiers, bombed out cities turned into hellish wastelands. Violence was flattened, aestheticized, left with the same emotional weight as a commercial or a video game cut-scene.\nThe need to distance the public from the reality of war extended to entertainment. Songs that referenced New York, airplanes, or Benny and his jets, were banned from major radio stations. And if you were a member of the political or media elite that publicly professed skepticism of the war, or questioned its underlying logic that equated buying flat screens with freedom, you were blocked from joining the spectacle. It was harsh, but even if you were Bill Maher or Phil Donahue, your show could be canceled if you went too far off script.\nBut after the failure of the occupation in Iraq, brand loyalty slowly shifted. After so many seasons, and so many depressing plot turns, the War on Terror had lost the public\u2019s interest. Whole swathes of the Middle East had been turned into wastelands; tens of thousands of American men and women had been wounded, killed or traumatized by nearly a decade of violence. But by 2008, there were more pressing issues to focus on \u2014 namely the collapse of the housing market and the financial system that was funding the whole thing. The election of the nation\u2019s first black president was a further sign to a majority of Americans that change was coming; hope was just around the corner. Toby Keith was out, Macklemore was in.\nBut even as the war faded from the public spotlight its impacts on civilian life would be permanent. While most people were glued to American Idol or Game of Thrones, the police were being armed and trained as an occupying force.\nIn the mid 90s, Congress approved the 1033 and 1122 programs, which allowed civilian police departments to purchase or receive, free of charge, billions of dollars of ex-military equipment from the Department of Defense. As a result of these programs, on the eve of 9/11, most major police departments had some M-16s, ballistic vests, or other ex-military equipment on hand.\nBut the War on Terror dramatically changed the scale and impact of the 1033 and 1122 programs. After 9/11, the Department of Homeland Security funded a series of anti-terror grants to allow police departments to purchase new military-grade gear. Soon, local PDs had armored personnel carriers (APC), rocket launchers, and flash bang grenades at their disposal. Although the gear was supposed to be used to prevent terror attacks, there was so much of it around that cops ended up using it on an everyday basis. How could they not? It all looked so cool, so tactical.\nSoon your average suburban cop was not only equipped like a military soldier, but acted like one. Either through formal training or informal example, civilian police learned to treat every individual as an armed threat and every situation as a deadly encounter. Under this new ethos, officers were no longer civil servants, there to \u201cserve and protect\u201d their local community, but Warriors occupying a hostile population that only understood one thing: total domination. \u201cRemain humble and compassionate; be professional and courteous,\u201d an article on police command presence states, \u201cand have a plan to kill everyone you meet.\u201d\nIf the Patriot Act implicitly turned the homeland into a war zone, the militarization of police made it explicit. Turning cops into warriors ensured that every American could be subjected to the same arbitrary violence and lack of legal recourse inflicted by soldiers on colonial subjects abroad. Step out of line \u2014 drive 27 mph in a 25, or jaywalk in front of a JcPenny\u2019s \u2014 and your skull could be cracked the same as if you were a Shiite on the streets of Mosul.\nBut the militarization of the home front didn\u2019t end with police. The Warrior ethos was a new, darker form of consumer patriotism, quickly packaged and sold to the masses. In the years after 9/11, a multi-billion dollar industry grew selling tactical seat warmers, active shooter courses, and pro-Second Amendment hoodies to disgruntled dentists and angry soccer moms around the country. Brands like 5.11 clothing exploded in popularity, exploiting their customers\u2019 paranoia to sell coyote brown cargo pants that rolled off the assembly line with 9mm magazine ready pockets. Soon after 9/11, GMC released the Hummer H2, a gas-guzzling, \u00be-sized model of the real Hummers that were ferrying troops across the deserts of Mesopotamia. It was the dawn of the Tactical Age, a fully commodified, fully aggrieved world of corporate militaria coming to a Wal-Mart near you.\nThese new commodities glorified the same colonial hyper-vigilance of law enforcement and their military counterparts. They sold a fantasy world where a trip to Red Lobster required the same tactical preparation \u2014 and threat of imminent violence \u2014 as a night patrol on the streets of Fallujah. And their market share would only grow as economic conditions worsened for their target demographic \u2014 the anxiety-ridden, suburban middle-class.\nThe 2008 financial crisis dramatically reshaped American society by cutting off the flow of credit that had funded years of war and consumer excess. After Obama bailed out the banks, and rescued the financial oligarchy from the implosion of their own Ponzi-scheme, it was clear who was central to the national project. And for the first time in post-War America, it wasn\u2019t middle-class homeowners.\nMeanwhile, the War on Terror continued, of course, but it no longer acted as a symbolic center of American culture. Instead, it kept grinding away in the background, doing what it was built to do all along \u2014 funnel taxpayer money into the pockets of private contractors, help the CIA traffic heroin from Central Asia, and pad the resumes of empty political strivers.\nAlthough the middle-class saw their conditions slowly deteriorate throughout the Obama years, they were not going down without a fight. As far as they were concerned, they were the bedrock of the economic and cultural order; They were America. According to their logic, every institution had turned their back on them \u2014 the media, the government, the banks, even football \u2014 but now it was time for revenge. Which is why, not unsurprisingly, they elected Donald Trump.\nWith Trump the spectacle became all-consuming, a 24/7 theater of sadism and domination opposed by an endless cycle of outrage and empty protest. Everyone fell for the trap \u2014 corporations, social media sites, editorial boards \u2014 because their business models depended on it. The only thing that mattered was subscribers, clicks, and ad-revenue. Attention, sanctified by profit, was its own virtue.\nBrands like Black Rifle Coffee capitalized on the Trump era culture war, inverting liberal corporate activism by performing provocative social-media stunts \u2014 photoshopping ISIS members with Starbucks or filming coffee commercials with tanks and American flags. Now, buying a bag of coffee beans was not only patriotic, but revolutionary.\nBut for a small, radical core, it wasn\u2019t enough to buy an army green F150, or wear a Blue Lives Matter sticker on their hardhat \u2014 they craved martyrdom, to be fully subsumed within the spectacle.\nOn January 6th, a loose confederation of tribes bearing Gadsden flags, QAnon hats, Pepe t-shirts, and Three-percenter patches marched to the Capitol. What their clothes, gear, and emblems represented was a distillation of twenty years of a society dominated by imperial wars, militarized on the home front, and addicted to the spectacle of violence.\nWhat they believed was simple. Power does not come from laws, religion, or the empty rituals of democracy, but by force. Violence is its own legitimizer. It is the credo of a fading colonial power, turned inward on its own subjects, tired of pretending that it owes its citizens anything more than their lives.\nThe Capitol police stepped aside because they not only believed the same thing, but had been trained in it. The National Security State chose to look away because although they disliked the man, they agreed with the methods. (Or were cynical enough to know what could be gained from their inaction.)\nOn January 6th, a mob of conspiracy-addled drunks and half-wits held the seat of global power just long enough to fart in it.

To make sure I\u2019m ready, I packed a lunch.\nIn the spirit of scientific inquiry, I\u2019ll bring an open mind \u2014 to accept the Truth, even if it happens to shake my deeply held beliefs.\nBecause there\u2019s a rock art panel in southeastern Utah that proves \u2014 beyond the shadow of a doubt \u2014 the Bible is real, that man and dinosaurs coexisted as described in the Book of Genesis. Better yet, it\u2019s not too long of a hike.\nI reach the trailhead, and descend along an icy trail to the bottom of a deep sandstone canyon. It\u2019s the middle of winter, and the terrain does not look very dinosaur friendly. The lush swamp of ancient eons is gone, replaced by the lean flora of the Colorado Plateau \u2014 knotty sage brush, pine-green ephedra, some skeletal cottonwoods. In this desert-hardened corner of southeast Utah, it\u2019d be hard to find enough forage to fill a salad bowl, let alone feed a family of hadrosaurs.\nAfter a few minutes poking around, I see it. There, ten feet above the canyon floor is a pecked image of a long necked sauropod, tail curved around its body. It\u2019s weather-worn and fuzzy in the bright winter light, but squint hard enough and yes, you could imagine it\u2019s a dinosaur carved by some ancient man.\nThe \u201csauropod\u201d, seen somewhere in the center of the image | photo by: author\nIf true, it\u2019s truly revelatory. Jurassic Park I through VI (coming soon) are not just wrong, but redundant. Man and dinosaur can, and did, coexist.\nBut being the modern skeptic I am, I need to know more. I need to understand how this drawing of a dinosaur supports the claims made by its online proponents \u2014 Scientific Creationists, a group of bowtie wearing con men who use pseudoscience to advance a literal interpretation of the Bible. Thankfully, Creationism, like any good scientific theory, starts with a compelling story. It goes something like this:\nIn the first week, God created the universe and all life within it.\nThen, for the next 1600 years, He sat back and watched as His creations spread across the Earth, eating, breeding, fighting, and dying. Occasionally some clumsy mastodon or half-wit sauropod would get trapped in a puddle of mud, die, and be turned into stone. But the process was so rare, and the time scale so short, that the evidence they left \u2014 the fossil record \u2014 was always incomplete.\nBut there were other clues, left by those who had been around since Day One.\nPicture just another Saturday in southeast Utah, sometime around 2400 B.C. There\u2019s a family hanging out, watching from their cave as a herd of Triceratops graze on the swampy plains beneath them. Dad is barbecuing sauropod steaks, the kids are playing with rocks, mom\u2019s wearing her new pterosaur-leather dress. Not exactly paradise, but close.\nThen, came the Flood.\nA surge of water, tens of thousands of feet deep, covers the Earth. Our band of clever, nimble not-apes, quickly scramble up the nearest cliffs to safety. But the dinosaurs, clumsy, tail-dragging beasts they are, don\u2019t make it and most of them perish in the deluge.\nOur family watches as a Tyrannosaur roars and desperately claws at the base of their cliff, trying to escape the rising waters. But God has cursed the beast with tiny arms, too skimpy to climb when he needed it most. Tough luck bro \u2014 it\u2019s divine selection, survival of the righteous.\nBut as the water settles, things don\u2019t go well for our family. Dad\u2019s got no beasts to broil. Mom\u2019s fashion is antediluvian. The kids are bored, tired of tossing around the same old rocks. Trapped on their little ledge, with little food and less fellowship, our patriarch \u2014 master of his family and inheritor of the world \u2014 begins to doubt the Creator. But then, one day, a glimmer of hope begins to shine through.\nHe spies a massive boat in the distance, as big as a mountain, gliding through the waves. The air tingles with the far-off screeching of birds and the bellowing of oxen. But like the tyrannosaur, God has doomed our family. They weren\u2019t one of the Chosen \u2014 they didn\u2019t heed the warnings, or bother to build a boat \u2014 and so are left to their fate.\nThe ship is sailing away; desperate, the wife and kids make a break for it. They leap off the cliff ledge, thrash around for a bit, and then sink beneath the waves.\nDying alone, our patriarch scrambles over to the cliff walls. He grabs a rock and a triceratops horn and begins to chip away at the sandstone. To better times, he thinks. He pecks a crude image of a sauropod in profile, his once favorite meat to grill. Exhausted, he collapses, and rolls off the cliff into the sea. But there\u2019s a lesson in his sacrifice \u2014 thousands of years in the future, his final act will show the faithful that the Bible, and everything in it, is absolutely real.\nIt\u2019s a wonderful story, and I squint again at the panel to fully process this revelation. Unfortunately, in my intervening daydream the clouds have come out and blocked the sun. Now in the gray light, the sauropod actually looks more like a polish sausage with legs. Did Ancient Man have sauerkraut? So many questions fill my mind and thankfully the one I\u2019m most interested in \u2014 whether this panel is a dinosaur, a hot dog, or possibly something else \u2014 has already been answered by legitimate scientists.\nA 2011 peer-reviewed study found that the \u201cdinosaur\u201d panel I visited was actually a series of different geometric designs pecked out by prehistoric Native Americans. The researchers determined that it was an illusion caused by pareidolia, the tendency to see meaningful images out of vague or random stimuli. Another famous piece of Creationist \u201cdinosaur\u201d rock art in southeast Utah \u2014 the Black Dragon panel \u2014 also turned out to be a series of separate images that were outlined with chalk to look like a winged creature.\n\u201cPterosaur\u201d or Black Dragon panel dissected, highlighted independent images confirmed by archeologists | photo by: author\nOther pieces of Creationist \u201cevidence\u201d \u2014 pottery with Incan warriors spearing velociraptors, human footprints in Mesozoic strata \u2014 have been found to be hoaxes. Despite their best efforts, scientific evidence to support Scientific Creationism is, not surprisingly, non-existent.\nIt may seem surprising that almost 200 years after The Origin of Species, resistance to evolution is as prevalent and stupid as ever. The Institute of Creation Research, which promotes the Utah dinosaur panels, has over 500,000 members. The Creationist museum in Kentucky \u2014 with an 80-foot long replica of Noah\u2019s Ark and a new exhibit touting 5,000 year old dinosaur bones \u2014 receives almost 800,00 visitors per year. There\u2019s still plenty of money to be made selling tickets to Adam and Eve riding the back of an animatronic T. Rex.\nThe grim reality is that pareidolia goes beyond the occasional rock art panel. It informs the way we interpret the world, and how we decide what theory \u2014 or story \u2014 describes reality, regardless of the evidence.\nThe theory of evolution is not all that catchy. The process of slow, hereditary change over time, either due to tiny advantages or random events, does not really draw the crowds. There\u2019s no heroes, no villains. And our favorite characters \u2014 humans \u2014 are non-essential to the plot, a bit role at best.\nThe Creationists\u2019 advantage is they sell a narrow story where mankind still plays the leading role. We were created, given mastery over the Earth and all its creatures, and then were reborn as God. In this script, humans are always at the center of a finite, meaningful world. There\u2019s a clear Beginning, and any day now, we\u2019re told, a rapturous End (for the righteous, anyway). It is pareidolia for the soul \u2014 a way to imagine order in chaos, meaning in randomness.\nThe fact that there is no scientific evidence \u2014 nor ever will be \u2014 to support this story is irrelevant. Creationism persists because it performs a social function; It co-opts the tools of science to reinforce traditional religious, ethnic, and male-dominated hierarchies paradoxically undermined by centuries of scientific progress. It\u2019s a snake lazily chasing after its own tail.\nAs famous rabbi and Holy Land archeologist Nelson Glueck said, biblical literalists are \u201cessentially of little faith who seek through archaeological corroboration of historical source materials in the Bible to validate its religious teachings and spiritual insights\u201d. For Christians who spend more time reading Twitter than the Old Testament, Creationism is another way to show belief without bothering to have any of it.\nWhich means that it\u2019s not going extinct anytime soon.", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 0, "created_time": 1641412928808, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Evolution", "Creationism", "Archeology", "Utah", "Rock Art"]}, {"author": "Devon Price", "post_id": "b45cdcc1083c", "user_id": "7fe325749a24", "title": "I Refuse to Kill People by Pretending Things Are Fine", "content": "I Refuse to Kill People by Pretending Things Are Fine\nNormal life isn\u2019t coming back. To pretend otherwise is deadly.\nPatrons wait outside Caffe Dante in New York City on March 19, 2020, days after bars and restaurants were limited to to-go orders by the city. Photo: Victor J. Blue/Getty Images\nThe few times I\u2019ve gone out to \u201cenjoy\u201d a nonessential service since shelter-in-place began in Chicago, I\u2019ve found it to be an intensely guilt-ridden, hollow experience. Buying a coffee, getting a sandwich, shopping for clothes at Target when I didn\u2019t really need to \u2014 I thought these exercises would feel comforting and normal. Instead, they have felt like a perverse mimicry of my old life, a game of pretend played at the expense of workers with a lot less power and security than me.\nA week ago, I went to a walk-up window and bought a bubble tea. The shop had been open all month, ever since Illinois entered the tentative \u201cPhase 2\u201d of its reopening plan. I told myself what I was doing was safe. I reasoned it was good for me to support a small business. I hoped it would feel familiar and reassuring to make a silly, small purchase, and thought I deserved to dip a tentative toe back into the pool of normalcy.\nThe bubble tea shop was shuttered, all its regular tables and chairs piled up in the back. The door was locked, and one window was open a fraction of an inch. A lone employee was behind the counter, making drinks. You were supposed to signal to him you were ready to order by waving at the webcam that had been set up at the window.\nWhen I made my order, the bubble shop employee stood as far away from the slit in the window as possible. A mask protected his face, blue latex gloves covered his hands. We struggled to understand one another through the layers of fabric and glass that separated us. When I pushed my money through the window, he took a step back with his arm extended awkwardly, maintaining as much distance as possible. When he handed me my drink a few minutes later, there was an urgency to his gestures; by shoving-off the drink, he silently begged me to take it and get away from him as quickly as I could.\nTaking my drink from this clearly uncomfortable young man, I felt like a monster. It seemed absolutely perverse to subject another human being to all this discomfort and panic. I had imagined buying a drink would be a nice little respite, a fun diversion on one of Chicago\u2019s first properly sunny days. Instead, it felt totally amoral and chilling. Walking home with it in my hand, I felt embarrassingly out of touch with the world, selfish to the point of being pathetic.\nThe world had been fundamentally transformed, and my purchase was a blatant attempt at denying that fact. I had tried to behave like life was returning to normal, but there was nothing normal about the transaction. There will be no more normal transactions, no thoughtless encounters, no guilt-free purchases. I\u2019m coming to terms with that. I can\u2019t understand why other people won\u2019t.\nIn many of us there lurks the dangerous, selfish desire to pretend that things are fine. I recognize it for the willful self-delusion that it is, yet I still succumb to it. I try to fight it off for a while, cooking my meals at home and brewing stale coffee. But after a few weeks, the monotony wears thin, and the despair looms, and then I reach for pointless objects and frivolous services, believing that if I spend money with the abandon I once did, I will feel free.\nI\u2019ve done the compulsive Amazon-nesting so many other people have. I bought a yoga mat to lounge on, candles to de-stink my apartment, a color-shifting LED lamp I use to read while in the bathtub. I\u2019ve walked to a caf\u00e9 and ordered a latte using an iPad the owner had screwed to a brick wall outside the door. I\u2019ve gotten takeout from restaurants where I used to eat.\nI can cling to the symbols of my old life, but it\u2019s never coming back. The sooner I accept it, the less harm I will do.\nI try to justify these choices to myself. Yet I can\u2019t help but recognize each one of these purchases is but a useless, lapidary little flower growing at the end of a long tendril of human suffering. For every silly, pointless object I buy, there are dozens of humans who were forced to come into work, made to toil in masks and gloves so I can imagine society is intact and everything is fine.\nIt\u2019s never going to be fine. I can cling to the symbols of my old life, but it\u2019s never coming back. The sooner I accept it, the less harm I will do.\nI haven\u2019t been able to stop thinking about the employee at the bubble tea shop. His discomfort was so palpable. I cannot fathom that throughout the country, there are thousands, maybe millions of Americans going through such uncomfortable, stilted transactions on a daily basis, and doing so gleefully, seeing it as an expression of their liberty. It seems impossible to me that someone could do what I did, over and over again, and feel zero remorse.\nChicago will likely remain in some form of lockdown for many months to come. Current projections hold that our curve won\u2019t peak until mid-June, and we\u2019ll be struggling to keep Covid-19 at bay for a long time after that. My home state of Ohio, however, is poised to open up. Indoor dining will be allowed beginning this week. On Friday, hair salons, gyms, and tattoo parlors will open back up. At the end of the month, children can begin going to daycare.\nLike so many other red and purple states, Ohio seems content to carry on as though the coronavirus never happened. It doesn\u2019t matter that the epidemiological data doesn\u2019t support reopening. People have gotten bored with quarantine. Without businesses to frequent and objects to amass, many Americans are left without a means of expressing their identity, or of connecting with the outside world. They can\u2019t tolerate that. The existential emptiness of it is too profound. And so they are going to go back to the malls and the movie theaters, pretending life is as it once was.\nI am terrified for everyone I know and love who lives in Ohio, and will be subjected to the spike in cases this experiment will undoubtedly cause. I am horrified to think of the millions of Ohioans who are about to flock back to sit-down dining establishments, and go back to getting haircuts and tattoos, subjecting themselves and others to massive risk in the name of feeling, briefly, as though everything is okay.\nNormal life is dead. It had to die so that millions of people might live.\nAll over the country, people have been taking up arms and protesting for the right to be so reckless. I wonder if any of those protesters tried exercising their rights and wound up feeling hollow the way I did. Does going to TGI Fridays feel the same to them as it used to? Are they comfortable getting their toenails buffed and polished by a terrified worker who is only there under immense financial duress? When they extract these services from people, do they tip 20%? Are they completely inured to what they are doing?\nI don\u2019t see how it\u2019s possible to inconvenience and terrorize service workers repeatedly like this, without feeling a shred of regret. Yet I know that\u2019s happening all across the United States, countless times per day. I understand the desire to go out and do these things. I fantasize about sidling up to the bar and ordering a hard cider, too. But I find it impossible to understand anyone who has actually followed through with that desire, and found it remotely satisfying.\nSitting at a restaurant table shrouded in shower curtains is not a return to normal life. Getting a massage from a glove-covered hand won\u2019t heal the pain of isolation. There is no pre-Covid world lurking out there that we can return to. Normal life is dead. It had to die so that millions of people might live. Denying that fact only leads to perverted, distorted attempts at reliving old experiences, usually at the expense of dozens of vulnerable people.\nInstead of trying to return to my old way of life, I am choosing to accept my old life is gone. I\u2019m grateful I even get to make such a realization. Many people haven\u2019t been so lucky. They\u2019ve either died, or been forced to labor in unsafe conditions to help prop up another person\u2019s fantasy of regularity.\nThe luxuries I\u2019ve lost are meaningless, and every attempt at winning them back has felt far more horrific than simply doing away with them. I don\u2019t need to get back to the bars. I don\u2019t \u201cdeserve\u201d a new tattoo. I can live without concerts and tanning salons. Keeping other people alive feels much better than whatever pleasure these diversions could give me.\nOur lives have changed, and will remain changed forever. We are much better off when we accept that fact. We can\u2019t bargain with the coronavirus; we can\u2019t pivot around it in a way that allows us to pretend it\u2019s not there. All we can do is stop grasping for our old modes of existence, knowing that in so doing, we are helping to keep other people alive. That realization is worth a lot more than any haircut ever was.", "comment_count": 64, "like_count": 4981, "created_time": 1589994347952, "comment": [{"user_id": "7fe325749a24", "comment_time": 1589994347952, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "61b90731c06c", "comment_time": 1590024344058, "comment": "In a way, though, this has always been the case to some extent\u200a\u2014 it\u2019s only just now being highlighted.

But she didn\u2019t \u201clook Autistic enough\u201d to get easily diagnosed in the 1990s, when she was growing up.\n\u201cMy mom actually thought I should get assessed,\u201d she says. \u201cBut my grandpa shut it down. He was all, no, no way, Crystal\u2019s such a good girl! There\u2019s nothing wrong with her. Don\u2019t even think about stuff like that.\u201d\nCrystal\u2019s grandfather probably figured he was protecting her from getting stuck with a label that would bring a lifetime of abuse. He certainly isn\u2019t alone in that. Label avoidance (taking steps to evade diagnosis) is a very common consequence of disability and mental health stigma. Publicly identifying as disabled does mean being viewed as less competent \u2014 \u00adand less human \u2014 \u00adby many people. As damaging and self-\u00addefeating as it can be to camouflage one\u2019s disability status, it is by no means an irrational act. It\u2019s a rational reflection of the prejudices disabled people face. It\u2019s not unique to Autism, either; many people with mental illnesses and hidden physical disabilities elect to avoid the mark of shame a diagnosis might bring.\nMy dad hid his cerebral palsy and seizure disorder for his entire life. No one knew about his condition other than my grandmother, my mom, and eventually me. He never went to college because he would have needed to reveal his access needs to campus disability services. He only ever applied to jobs that didn\u2019t require him to write or type, lest his poor fine motor control be revealed. As a child, I typed up the flyers for his lawn mowing business, because he couldn\u2019t work the computer himself.\nI only found out about his condition as a teenager; he sobbingly confessed it to me, as if it were a terrible secret, after his marriage to my mother had already fallen apart. He told me that his mother had made him hide his condition because it wouldn\u2019t have been acceptable to be openly disabled in the tiny Appalachian town where he grew up. Shame and self-\u00adloathing followed him until the day that he died of diabetes (a condition he developed as an adult and also refused to treat).\nI didn\u2019t find out I was Autistic until many years after his death, but he was the first person who demonstrated to me just how painful and self-\u00addestructive hiding your disability can be. He had erected an entire life around hiding who he was, and his defense mechanisms had slowly killed him.\nLabel avoidance was common among the parents of potentially Autistic children during the 1990s, because the condition was so poorly understood and demonized. Autistic people were assumed to be intellectually disabled, and intellectual disabled people were not valued or respected, so many families did their damnedest to keep the label off their kids\u2019 backs. Though Crystal\u2019s grandfather intended to protect her from bigotry, and from being infantilized, he also denied her important self-\u00adknowledge, educational resources, and a place in the Autistic community. Without consulting Crystal, her family determined it would be better for her to suffer and hide her neurodiversity than to have a name for her marginalized position in the world. The weight of this decision is one Crystal continues to deal with now, as an adult who was diagnosed in her late twenties.\n\u201cNow I know I\u2019m Autistic, but I kinda found out about it too late,\u201d she says. \u201cIf I tell people, they don\u2019t want to believe me. I have my life together too much for them to realize how hard it all is. Nobody wants to hear now about how hard it\u2019s always been, always still is, frankly.\u201d\nAt this point, I have heard hundreds of Autistic people tell versions of Crystal\u2019s story. Some of the details change, but the narrative arc is always the same: A child exhibits early signs of difficulty, but their families and teachers balk when disability is raised. Parents or grandparents who themselves have Autism spectrum traits dismiss the child\u2019s complaints, claiming that everybody suffers from the social stress, sensory sensitivities, stomach issues, or cognitive fuzziness they themselves experience.\nEveryone in the child\u2019s life views disability not as an explanation of how a person functions (and what help they need in order to function), but a sign of damage. So they push the label away, and tell their child to stop making such a fuss. Believing they are helping their child \u201crise above\u201d a limitation and be tough, they encourage the child not to be visibly odd, or to ever ask for assistance.\nThough a masked Autistic child has no way of explaining why they find life so difficult, they suffer all the same. Peers detect there\u2019s something unnameably \u201coff\u201d about them, and exclude them despite their best attempts at friendliness. When the child makes themselves small and inobtrusive, they\u2019re granted some of the affection they desperately crave and never get enough of. So they do it more and more, quieting the voice inside themselves that says how they\u2019re being treated isn\u2019t fair. They work hard, demand little, and play by society\u2019s rules as closely as possible.\nThe child grows into an adult who is even more self-\u00adeffacing, and even less capable of voicing how they feel. Then, after decades of forcing themselves into a restrictive neurotypical box, they have some kind of breakdown that finally makes all the turmoil bubbling beneath the surface impossible to ignore. It\u2019s only then that they discover they\u2019re Autistic.\nIn Crystal\u2019s case, the breaking point took the form of a months-\u00adlong case of Autistic burnout. Autistic burnout is a state of chronic exhaustion where an Autistic person\u2019s skills begin to degrade, and their tolerance to stress is greatly reduced. It hit Crystal like a Mack truck after she completed her senior thesis in college.\nCollege had taken her a few years longer than the rest of her friends, though she couldn\u2019t explain exactly why. She was always having to drop classes in order to hold her life together. A full course load just wasn\u2019t possible. When people asked about it, she lied and said she also worked a full-\u00adtime job.\nIn her final year of college, Crystal was required to oversee set design for the theater department\u2019s biggest show of the year. Designing dozens of props, sourcing their materials, managing the building of them, and then keeping track of all the items in a big Google spreadsheet was simply too stressful for her to manage, especially while taking her final remaining classes. She pushed through, losing hair and losing weight, but once the project was completed, she collapsed.\n\u201cAfter I graduated, I was in bed at my mom\u2019s house for three months,\u201d she says. \u201cDidn\u2019t apply to jobs. I barely showered, had all these McDonald\u2019s wrappers on the floor of my bedroom, and my family still insisted I was just being lazy.\u201d\nEventually, Crystal became so lethargic that she no longer wanted to watch TV or play with the family dog. That was concerning enough for her mother to suggest she go see a therapist. An Autism assessment came shortly thereafter.\n\u201cAt first I couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d Crystal says. \u201cMy family still doesn\u2019t believe it. They had every indication, my whole life, but they don\u2019t want to see it.\u201d\nAt last, Crystal had an explanation for why she couldn\u2019t get as much done as other people, and why basic-\u00adseeming tasks like running to the bank or sitting through a two-\u00adhour lecture left her too tired to think or speak. Regular life actually did require more willpower out of her; Autistic people frequently experience inertia in starting a task, and challenges in breaking complex activities down into small steps that follow a logical sequence. This can make everything from basic household chores to applying to jobs and filing taxes incredibly challenging, or even impossible without help.\nIn addition to all the baseline cognitive and sensory challenges that came with Autism for Crystal, she was also having to put a lot of energy into always seeming \u201cnormal.\u201d She constantly fought the urge to suck on her fingers, and when people spoke to her, she had to forcibly point her attention at their words and face. Reading a book took her twice as long as the average person. All she had the energy to do at the end of the day was sit in bed and eat french fries. Crystal\u2019s mother and grandfather were unsatisfied by this newfound explanation, though. They said that if she had really been hurting that bad all her life, they would have realized it.\n\u201cI wish I could make them understand,\u201d she says, \u201cAutism isn\u2019t what you think.\u201d\n\u2026\nWhen I moved to Chicago for graduate school in the summer of 2009, I had no idea I\u2019d need to make friends. I was twenty-one years old, serious, and socially withdrawn, and I truly believed I did not need other people. I had an eating disorder that had ravaged my digestive system, and gender dysphoria that made me resent how other people saw me, though I didn\u2019t yet understand why.\nI didn\u2019t know how to approach people or initiate conversations, and I didn\u2019t care to learn, because most interactions left me feeling irritated and unheard. The few relationships I did have were enmeshed; I took responsibility for others\u2019 problems, tried to manage their emotions for them, and lacked any capacity to say \u201cno\u201d to unreasonable requests.\nI believed something was fundamentally wrong with me. I seemed to be broken in ways I couldn\u2019t explain, but which everyone else could see at a glance. I spent several years languishing, working myself to the point of burnout, having emotional breakdowns, and googling things like \u201chow to make friends\u201d in the middle of the night. Through it all, I never considered asking for help or sharing with anyone how I felt. I lived by a very narrow set of rules, and remaining independent and invulnerable was chief among them.\nThings finally began to change for me in 2014, on a family vacation at Cedar Point amusement park in Sandusky, Ohio. My cousin started talking to me about all the things he struggled with \u2014 how hard it was to relate to classmates, how adrift and overstimulated he felt. A therapist had floated Autism as a likely explanation.\nThen my cousin pointed out all the Autistic traits he\u2019d noticed were common in our family. None of us could handle talking about our emotions and mostly interacted using a surface-level script. We rambled on and on about the subjects that interested us, even if it bored others to tears. We were easily overwhelmed by change and rarely went out into the world to have new experiences or make friends.\nWhen my cousin told me all this, I felt dread. Though I was a psychologist, all I knew about Autism was the broadest and most dehumanizing of stereotypes. Being Autistic would mean I was broken.\nOf course, I\u2019d already felt broken for years.\nPhoto by Damir Samatkulov on Unsplash\nThe more I read about Autism, the more things began clicking into place. I had always been overwhelmed by loud sounds and bright lights. I got inexplicably angry in crowds; laughter and chatter could make me blow up with rage. When I got too stressed out or became overcome with sadness, I found it hard to speak. I\u2019d hidden all this for years because I was certain it made me a joyless, unlovable asshole. Now I was beginning to wonder why I believed such awful things about myself.\nI discovered there was an entire movement led by Autistic people, who argued we should view the disability as a perfectly normal form of human difference. These thinkers and activists said our way of being wasn\u2019t wrong at all; it was society\u2019s failure to adapt to us that left us feeling broken. I found out there were thousands of Autistics just like me, who discovered their disability in adulthood after years of confused self-loathing. They had been forced to developed coping strategies to blend in. Things like staring at a person\u2019s forehead to simulate eye contact, or memorizing conversational scripts based they saw on TV.\nI noticed that there were clear patterns in which kinds of Autistic people succumbed to this fate. Autistic women, transgender people, and people of color often had their symptoms ignored when they were young, or had their Autistic traits interpreted as \u201cmanipulative\u201d or \u201caggressive.\u201d So did Autistic people who grew up in poverty, without access to mental health resources. Gay and gender nonconforming men often didn\u2019t fit the masculine image of Autism well enough to be diagnosed. Older Autistics never had the opportunity to be assessed, because knowledge about the disability was so limited during their childhoods.\nThese systematic exclusions had forced an entire massive, diverse population of disabled people to live in obscurity. This gave rise to what I am now calling masked Autism \u2014 a camouflaged version of the disorder that\u2019s still widely neglected by researchers, mental health providers, and neurotypical-led Autism organizations.\nWhen I use the term masked Autism, I\u2019m referring to any presentation of the disability that deviates from the standard \u201cwhite boys obsessed with trains\u201d image we see in most diagnostic tools and nearly all media portrayals of Autism. I\u2019m also talking about any Autistic person whose suffering wasn\u2019t taken seriously for reasons of class, race, gender, age, lack of access to health care, or the presence of other conditions.\nWhen an Autistic person is not given resources or access to self-knowledge, and when they\u2019re told their symptoms are just signs that they\u2019re a disruptive, overly sensitive, or annoying kid, they have no choice but to develop a neurotypical fa\u00e7ade. Maintaining that neurotypical mask feels deeply inauthentic and it\u2019s extremely exhausting to maintain. It\u2019s also not necessarily a conscious choice.\nMasking is a state of exclusion forced onto us from the outside. A closeted gay person doesn\u2019t just decide one day to be closeted \u2014 they\u2019re essentially born into the closet, because heterosexuality is assumed in our culture, and being gay is treated as a rare afterthought or an aberration.\nSimilarly, Autistic people are born with the mask of neurotypicality pressed against our faces. We only get the opportunity to take our masks off when we realize other ways of being exist. Learning to live authentically as an Autistic person is a lengthy process for those of us who have masked all our lives. However, exploring a neurodivergent identity and beginning to forge community alongside other disabled people are crucial first steps.\nThe cover of my new book, Unmasking Autism: Discovering the New Faces of Neurodiversity.\nExcerpted from UNMASKING AUTISM copyright \u00a9 2022 by Devon Price.

I\u2019ve never known such peace.\nPhoto by Franck on Unsplash\nI\u2019ve been working on setting better social media boundaries lately. The more my follower count climbed on platforms like Twitter and Instagram, the more comments and direct messages I received \u2014and the smaller the percentage of worthwhile messages became. Though I was accustomed to using social media to make new friends and hold enjoyable conversations about social and economic justice, neurodiversity, and whatever nonsense Grimes was up to next, my notifications had increasingly become a source of torment and stress.\nI was getting Jokerfied, and fast. I could feel myself becoming less patient with redundant but entirely-good faith questions. Requests for information about my personal life were making me feel preyed upon and surveilled. And though I\u2019m an absolute advice column addict and just started writing my own, I began downright resenting the numerous, highly intricate dilemmas and traumas complete strangers kept dropping in my inbox.\nI wasn\u2019t the only one who noticed that my social media habits were falling out of step with my anti-work, anti-people-pleasing ideals. A friend of mine, also named Devon, let me know that several highly active Instagram \u201cmutuals\u201d who were unfailingly polite to me were downright sexist and predatory to her. My partner observed that I was devoting a lot of energy to processing the emotions of complete strangers \u2014 energy my sensitive, easily drained Autistic self doesn\u2019t come by easily. Some commenters criticized me for becoming too short-fused and snarky.\nThat last one really got under my skin. How dare my followers ask for so much free content, commentary, and support, then turn around and critique the tone in which I delivered it to them? Though each comment and message came from a unique individual with their own constellation of feelings and problems, I experienced my notifications as a coordinated barrage of demands. There were simply too many of them, and too little of me.\nOf course, I was the engineer of all of these problems. I had decided to create social media accounts and post writing to them on a daily basis. It was me who kept my inbox open to strangers, literally inviting the responses of tens of thousands of people. My actions had trained others to expect approachability and responsiveness from me. And if I found that giving that much of my time and attention away was no longer working for me, or enriching my work as a writer, well, I\u2019d have to be the one to change it.\nIt was time to give myself peace \u2014 and the stillness and silence necessary to form my own thoughts. If I wanted to continue being an effective writer and a loving, emotionally present friend, I\u2019d have to heal my relationship to social media.\nAnd so, I turned my comments off. I disabled message requests on Instagram and Twitter, so now the only people who can message me are people I already talk to regularly. I restricted my notifications to only the people I follow \u2014 turning my social media apps into, essentially, group messaging platforms for staying in contact with my actual friends. I\u2019ve also started restricting many of my Twitter threads so that only my friends can reply to them.\nIt has been absolute bliss. I haven\u2019t known such solitude and mental clarity in years. Here are some of the many improvements that locking down my social media has brought into my life:\nI\u2019m not constantly checking notifications.\nLike many people, I became a compulsive app-refresher during the pandemic. Social media provided me with fortifying social snacks during a time when I was starving. Looking at what people were posting and commenting was one of my sole ways of finding stimulating novelty and contact.\nBut the electrifying surge of social media notifications stung just as much as it energized: my attention was frayed and frantic, my heart always racing, my eyes forever strained. When my platform grew, notification-checking took on significantly higher stakes: there was always a fresh crop of racists, ableists and transphobic exclusionists leaving hateful messages on my pages, and an even larger crop of (perhaps) benevolently ignorant folks dropping bad takes and misinformation.\nNow that no one can comment on anything I post to social media, I can just sit back and let my words stand for themselves. I don\u2019t need to argue with people who have misinterpreted my work, or correct obvious misreads. When my phone lights up, my heart doesn\u2019t lurch into my throat out of fear that somebody\u2019s used my page to broadcast slurs. If I want to stay off social media for several days, I can \u2014 there are no comments to moderate, no potential fires to put out.\nI\u2019m no longer platforming nonsense, misinformation, or oppressive language.\nA comment section is an information distribution platform, albeit a small one. Even if you don\u2019t endorse everything your commenters have to say, you are, by virtue of having a comment section, providing people with a place to share their ideas \u2014 and a built-in audience for those ideas. Since I never had the time or patience to thoroughly moderate my comment section, I was providing my followers with a fertile field of bullshit.\nI always went through my posts and removed the most deeply objectionable replies, of course, but I couldn\u2019t keep up with every single person making half-baked claims \u2014 for example, allies asserting that the word \u201ctranssexual\u201d is always problematic (it isn\u2019t) or that some Autistics don\u2019t get diagnosed because they have \u201cfemale\u201d bodies (that\u2019s not the cause of masked Autism). Then there were the more pernicious, but stealthier comments: people claiming that men are innately more violent than women, for example, as way of arguing for policing and prisons.\n\u201cYou have to take MY wild interpretation of your post very seriously!!\u201d \u201cno.\u201d\nI\u2019ve spent years diligently building my social media platforms and public identity as a writer \u2014 why would I willingly lend the following I\u2019ve accrued to any random person hanging around in my mentions? It makes absolutely no sense for me to provide that outlet to just anyone. In fact, I have come to believe it\u2019s downright irresponsible for me to do so. Reading through comment sections and DMs is a habit-forming time sink \u2014 and I\u2019d rather spare both myself and my readers that distraction.\nI have more time (and brain space) for actual writing.\nMy inbox and comment sections used to be flooded with repetitive questions that individual people (quite understandably) could not recognize as repetitive. What should I do if I think I might be Autistic? Should I transition if I feel x, y, and z? Why don\u2019t you like the term \u201cfemale socialized\u201d? I want to learn more about abolition, any reading recs?\nI used to think I had a responsibility to answer these questions endlessly. I\u2019m an educator! I\u2019m lucky that so many people care what I think! And I do have answers to many of the questions I receive. The thing is, I\u2019ve already shared those answers \u2014 here on my Medium, as well as in Twitter threads, Instagram grid and story posts, and highlight reels. And oh yeah, in the two books I\u2019ve written.\nOne of my favorite things about writing is that once a project is done, it lasts forever. I can conduct my research, lay out my arguments, and then leave the work behind for anyone to discover and ponder when they\u2019re ready. I\u2019m not a patient person. I\u2019m hasty and my mind moves way too fast. With my writing, I can speak my peace and then move on to the next obsession.\n\u201cInfluencers be like: \u2018having my posts published on vice or buzzfeed or in a book without pay sucks.\u2019 My brother in Christ you made the decision to spend twenty four hours per day creating free public content on a shareable platform.\u201d\nIt\u2019s easy to forget, but posting, replying to messages, and responding to comments is writing \u2014 it\u2019s just piecemeal, inefficient writing that doesn\u2019t go anywhere, is not read by very many people, and does not pay my bills. So I don\u2019t do it anymore. If an idea is really worth exploring, it\u2019s worth doing in a more formal piece of writing that will outlast the algorithm.\nI resent humanity less.\nI am far more patient with people now that I don\u2019t have to respond to hundreds of random queries each day. There\u2019s only so much energy you can give away to other people before you start viewing humanity as vampiric \u2014 even when the decision to offer up your lifeblood was entirely your own.\nReflexively, I often behave like I\u2019m in a codependent relationship with the entire universe. It\u2019s not a healthy impulse, but I come by it quite honestly \u2014 my dad treated me as a proto-therapist for my entire childhood, and as an awkward Autistic nerd, I learned early on that I could trick people into liking me if I made myself useful. I often feel responsible for everyone\u2019s feelings, and take others\u2019 crises as a personal call to action. Then I wind up drained and pissed as hell when, invariably, I prove incapable of fixing someone else\u2019s life for them, or controlling their emotions.\nOnce you extend your empathy beyond its capacity, compassion fatigue sets in. It becomes difficult to care about other people or feel connected. I knew that I was absolutely screwed on this front once I began opening tender, appreciative messages thanking me for my work and feeling absolutely nothing about them. My heart had frozen over in order to protect me. It\u2019s terrible, losing the ability to feel strongly for others. It\u2019s like being half dead.\nNow that I am not bombarded with dozens of messages every day (some of them lovely, some of them hateful, nearly all of them emotionally intense), I can actually show up for my real-life relationships. Instead of inviting people to make endless demands of my time, I\u2019ve taken charge over where I direct my attention. I have no reason to resent other people anymore. My emotional limitations and boundaries are built into how I navigate social media.\nI read (a LOT) more.\nJust as posting on social media is writing, absorbing content on social media is reading \u2014 but it\u2019s a chaotic, stressful, unfocused form of reading that never satisfies, and never provides you a pause to reflect. I got into writing because I adore reading, and the slow, languid periods of meditation and insight that come from curling up with a good book. But during the last couple of years, I wasn\u2019t finding that kind of contemplative peace anymore. I was just scrolling all the time and getting stressed out over the same handful of unending, circular battles.\nEver since I shut down my comment sections and inbox, I\u2019ve been sucking down books like they\u2019re the day\u2019s first cup of coffee. The Dawn of Everything by Graeber and Wengrow was dense and beset with tangents, but utterly paradigm-shifting. Bren\u00e9 Brown\u2019s oeuvre is deeply flawed (especially when it comes to her unexamined fatphobia) but chock full of practical tips that will dramatically improve my next writing project. The Recovering by Leslie Jamison was gripping and impossible to put down. Beyond Shame by Patrick Moore transported me to a vitally important yet underexplored period of LGBT history, and then enriched my appreciation of ACT UP activism.\nI could go on and on, but suffice to say: not reading direct messages and comments has freed up a TON of time for reading calmly splayed out on my yoga mat, or in the tub. My eyes are grateful for the break from blue tinged lights and my intellectually starved brain is eating well for the first time in ages.\nI\u2019m giving the apps less attention and advertisers less revenue.\nSocial media was designed to be addictive and enraging. There are numerous tricks the apps use to keep you using them more often and for longer than you\u2019d like. For instance, have you ever noticed that when you first open Instagram, you\u2019re briefly shown a post from one of your favorite accounts, which quickly disappears as the site refreshes, giving you no time to read or like it? Have you ever caught yourself scrolling through your feed, trying to \u201ccatch up\u201d and find that disappeared post? I know I have! It happens to me a few times a week.\nYeah. That\u2019s a deliberate tactic social media app developers use to keep your attention trapped on their apps. So is the non-chronological nature of the feed itself, and the presence of \u2018suggested\u2019 accounts. So is the tendency for the algorithm to boost controversial or offensive posts filled with active, contentious comment sections. So is the very existence of comment sections.\nI\u2019ve written about this before, but comment sections are a great way for social media sites to boost advertiser revenue. The more you get swept up in a fight in the comments, the more times you\u2019ll return to the same page, giving the app more opportunities to try and sell something to you. And if you come to rely on a social media app as your primary messaging platform, well, that\u2019s even more time with your attention that Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and all the rest can sell to advertisers for a hefty fee.\nFacebook and Twitter have known for years that angry users are less judicious about how they spend their time, and more likely to get stuck refreshing the app over and over, firing off pissily little posts and getting distracted by arguments. They\u2019ve even conducted experiments on non-consenting users to determine there\u2019s an advantage to making people feel shitty. I know nothing makes me feel shittier on the apps that wading through a bunch of short-tempered infighting in my comment section.\nFor a long time it felt dirty, keeping comment sections open on my posts just for the sake of boosting their performance in the algorithm. Heavily commented-upon posts do get more attention. But all the extra \u201clikes\u201d I received came at the expense of my followers\u2019 time and wellbeing. It also came at the cost of my own peace of mind.\nI\u2019m not interested in making that deal with the devil anymore. I\u2019m willing to have my posts flop due to a lack of comments-based \u201cengagement,\u201d if it means I\u2019m not feeding the irrational outrage machine. And I know that without comment sections and messages to read, I spend less time on the apps and feel far less anxious and angry, too.\nI\u2019m no longer encouraging people to form parasocial connections with me.\nWhen you post a lot about yourself and your life online, people get attached to their idea of who you are. Sometimes, this is totally sweet and harmless. There are bloggers whose work I adore and follow with a fervent passion; I root for them when they say their life is getting hard, and throw money at their GoFundMe\u2019s when they need bottom surgery or to have a tooth removed.\nIt\u2019s nice to care about other people and feel bonded to someone through their creative work. But there\u2019s is a big difference between harboring good will for a creator whose work you like, and having the illusion that you actually know them or that they are your friend. Unfortunately, social media makes it very easy to develop parasocial relationships with popular content creators, where a fan truly believes they know that creator well and could become actual friends with them. This is especially true if direct messages, comment sections, and ask boxes give users the illusion of closeness.\nThis video on the nature of parasocial relationships is lengthy, but excellent.\nOne time a few years ago, I followed along happily as a fruitful conversation about social justice language policing unfolded in my comments section. It was a civil, positive discussion, with people trading resources and nuanced ideas. In that moment I was proud of having created a space where people could hold such productive discussions.\nAbout an hour later, a fight erupted on another post of mine \u2014 a Instagram slide set describing how \u201cno cis men\u201d event policies often prove hostile to trans women. The TERFs and transmisogynists were raging and brigading me, so I turned my comments off. A woman whom I\u2019d never met popped into my private messages to express her disappointment. She said I was \u201cshirking accountability\u201d and \u201csilencing the community\u201d by turning comments off in this way. I could only laugh out loud at the absurdity of it all.\nA digital following is not a community. There are no lasting relational bonds within a following list, no genuine social infrastructure, no healthy, horizontal methods of addressing conflict, and no means of remaining connected and invested in one another if the creator deletes their account. You might have a nice conversation in the replies of your favorite Twitter account, but that\u2019s like having a nice chat after the concert of your favorite musician. Any additional relationship building and community development that comes from that brief moment of contact is on you. You may be connected by mutual fandom, but a network of fans is not a community \u2014 no matter how much a creator might profit off you believing that it is.\nIn a similar vein, there is no possibility for real \u2018accountability\u2019 within a mass-marketed social media space. My readers can comment and critique and gnash their teeth at my actions all that they like \u2014 but if I have no genuine, mutually respectful relationship to the people posting about me, there is no possibility of me restoring any bond that has frayed. There was never an actual bond to be frayed in the first place. It was just a fandom. A fan can stop following or supporting me whenever they like, but that action is nothing like an actual friend terminating a relationship. Most of the time, I won\u2019t even notice that it\u2019s happened.\nI\u2019ve started taking responsibility for the ethics of my digital actions.\nEven though I\u2019m only a niche microinfluencer, my writing is often quite intimate. My posts explore fraught issues related to gender dysphoria, trauma recovery, and the formation of a political and social identity. I also post images of my face and my pet, and share about the music I\u2019m listening to and what I\u2019ve been reading. I enjoy sharing my thoughts and experiences with the world, and people often appreciate consuming them.\nBut some followers project a lot of assumptions onto me, based on the limited information I reveal, and color in between the lines in ways that garner a false sense of closeness. When my DMs were still open, people would sometimes tell me outlandishly obsequious things \u2014 they\u2019d claim my writing had saved their life, for instance, or said they feel like I understand them personally in ways no one else ever has.\nIf I were a more craven person, I could really turn perceived closeness that to my advantage. I could sell the ability to message me on Patreon, for instance, or create a Discord server that I brand as a \u201cfan community\u201d and charge access for it. I could accompany every post with a request for donations via PayPal or Venmo even though I have a full-time job and don\u2019t need that income. I\u2019ve seen numerous influencers do each of these things.\nBut I\u2019m never going to do anything of that, because I find it disgustingly inauthentic and emotionally manipulative. I am happy to provide readers with information and entertainment. I post what I like, when I feel like posting it,b because I find the activity enriching and expressive. But I\u2019m not going to use parasocial connections to line my own pockets or unduly expand my influence. If my ideas are strong enough, people will find and appreciate them \u2014 no exploitation or cajoling is necessary.\nUltimately, that\u2019s the primary reason I have decided to close my direct messages and shut my comments down. When I had those lines of communication open, I was encouraging followers to view me as an endless resource, a freely available platform, and a potential friend, all in one. It is no longer realistic for me to give people those kinds of expectations. And it\u2019s certainly not healthy for me.\nI\u2019ve reclaimed control of my boundaries and mental health.\nI\u2019ve been striving to establish healthier digital habits for a while now, and here\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learned: boundaries are a thing you do, not a thing you force others to respect. Healthy, maintainable boundaries are all about the ways in which we control our own actions and reduce the ability of other people to harm or intrude upon us. This means that often, setting or protecting a boundary is about limiting your vulnerability to violation, and removing yourself from unsafe or painful places where your wellbeing is not respected.\nThe internet is not a safe or respectful place. Social media applications are forever on the hunt for new methods of manipulating us, and exploiting our energy, creative output, and attention. The temptation to overexpose ourselves will always be here \u2014 and rather than appealing to my own willpower or the judgement of strangers to help me resist it, I have decided to remove its siren song from my life as much as possible.\nI\u2019m going to leave comments open here on Medium, where the feedback I receive is limited, thoughtful, and typically quite worthwhile. I\u2019m also maintaining a Curious Cat question box, so that readers can submit questions for my advice column or suggest essay topics. But when it comes to Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram?

I\u2019ve also created an Autistic Advice publication on Medium so readers can easily find all the previous entries, as well as other practical articles on how to go about unmasking, setting boundaries, and making new friends as an Autistic person.\nAutistic Advice is a semi-regular column where I respond to anonymous questions about neurodiversity, Autism acceptance, disability justice, and self-advocacy. You can submit questions for this column via my Curious Cat question box, linked here.\nToday\u2019s question comes from an Autistic woman who\u2019d like to know how to flirt with guys \u2014 and whether she should follow neurotypical advice telling her to \u201cplay dumb\u201d so guys will help her.\nHow as an autistic woman do I flirt?\nMost of the things people say you should do, like pretending not to understand something so a guy can explain it to you, just feel so cringey and fake.\nHi OP, thanks for your question! Before I dive into my response, I want to offer some caveats: I\u2019m not a straight woman, I\u2019m a gay trans man, so some of my perceptions might not be relevant to you. However, for the first twenty eight years of my life, I generally was assumed to be a woman, and I dated men in that mode.\nSince I\u2019m both gay and trans, I theoretically have inhabited a sexual marketplace that\u2019s way smaller and more competitive than yours is as a straight woman. You might think, because of this, that I have to play even more games than you do, and contort myself into even more restrictive people-pleasing shapes, because the dating market is scarce and my awkward, trans Autistic ass needs to take whatever I can get.\nBecause that\u2019s ultimately what the advice you\u2019ve received comes down to, isn\u2019t it? That in order for you to win romantic attention, you have to fake qualities you don\u2019t actually have? That there\u2019s no way a successful connection could be built upon a foundation of honesty, and that instead you must put on a performance, until you successfully trick someone into tolerating the real you lurking underneath?\nIf that\u2019s the message you\u2019ve been receiving from the neurotypicals (and straights) around you, I have very good news OP: not only is pretending to be someone you\u2019re not counter-productive to building a lasting romantic connection, it\u2019s also totally unnecessary for getting short-term sexual and romantic attention. You can do absolute numbers as a straight woman just by being utterly, weirdly yourself. And if what you\u2019re seeking is a deeper bond, authenticity is absolutely required.\nStraight, neurotypical people spread around a lot of supposedly common sense \u201crules\u201d about how to get attention and dates. And common sense, all too often, is jut a thoughtless regurgitation of oppressive social norms.\nA lot of the typical dating \u201crules\u201d will tell you to act like you\u2019re someone with fewer needs and less unique qualities than you actually have. Don\u2019t text the guy back too quickly. Laugh at a guy\u2019s jokes even if they aren\u2019t funny. Don\u2019t let him know if he\u2019s disappointed or offended you. Don\u2019t expect any level of attention or care. Pretend you don\u2019t know things. Pretend you don\u2019t have goals or a vision of the future that will rule many potential dating partners out.\nIt really fucks up neurotypicals\u2019 dating lives, entering intimate relationships based on this much inauthenticity. It makes communication impossible and sets people up for false expectations, projections, and resentment. How can you identify if someone would make a good partner for you, if you have to wait months (or even years) to find out who they really are beneath the traditional script? How can you trust anyone when everyone is expected to lie and conceal themselves in order to be liked?\nThese rules never made a whole lot of sense to me, but when I was closeted and masking my disability, I went along with many of them. I muted my extreme, obsessive interests and hid my emotions and shutdowns in hopes of appearing cool. I wasn\u2019t open about my sexual interests, and just fucked people dispassionately with fantasies playing about in the back of my head. I mirrored people\u2019s personalities and made my future a completely blank slate onto which guys could project whatever they imagined.\nThen in my early 20s, I started dating a guy I really, really liked \u2014 but I was terrified of coming across as needy and insecure around him. So I never initiated dates. Ever. I was never the first to message, either. I slipped completely into the passive, feminine \u201ccool girl\u201d role, and allowed him to set the cadence of our relationship. This meant we messaged once or twice a day, if that, and hung out about once a week.\nI was very unhappy with that. The longer we were together, the more it ravaged my self-esteem that he didn\u2019t want to see or talk to me that much. But I never said a thing about it. I just laid in bed, dreaming that I\u2019d earn his love by making our relationship painlessly easy. Then he\u2019d magically become more communicative and affectionate. All I\u2019d have to do is nothing.\nShockingly this did not work. My silence skewed both our expectations for the duration of the relationship. The guy quite reasonably continued following the communication patterns we\u2019d established early on, with no idea I was simmering with frustration. I did what I could to take care of his needs, and worked like hell to hide my own, played up the parts of me he liked and hid the ones that didn\u2019t make him laugh or relax into his seat \u2014 until there was basically none of the real me left in the relationship.\nA few years ago, I complained to my therapist about how unbalanced all my relationships felt. It seemed like I needed to be perfect at anticipating the needs of everyone around me. I felt like the only waiter working a packed brunch shift, rushing around doing everything, people only noticing my existence when I\u2019d failed them or gotten in the way. It wasn\u2019t just in my romantic relationships that I felt like this. My social and professional lives were that way, too.\nAfter I said this, my therapist drew back and blinked a few times. \u201cYou seem to vastly underestimate your likeability,\u201d he told me. \u201cYou think you can\u2019t risk alienating anyone, when actually there\u2019s far too many people who want your time.\u201d\nHis words were like a pail of ice water to the face. I was operating from a scarcity mentality. Like a lot of Autistics, I was really unpopular as a kid. As an adult, I still thought I had to cling to every bit of likeability I could find or feign. To prevent making people upset I said yes to everything, and shape-shifted my personality to try and appeal to everyone.\nImage of Snowball from The Simpsons wearing a variety of different clothes. Meme caption reads: \u201cWhen too many people you know from different places come together & you have to maintain the personality you\u2019ve created for each one at the same time.\u201d\nExperience eventually taught me that I had to become more selective. I had to develop the courage to let people dislike me. Even more crucially, I had to let myself recognize when I didn\u2019t like someone, and when their approval and attention might actually be damaging or draining to me.\nThere are so many people out there, OP, who are not worth your time. And you never need to compromise yourself or create an artificial personality to appeal to any of them. When you\u2019re looking for dates you do need to put effort into meeting new people and drawing them into your orbit \u2014 but identifying who to cut from that potential dating pool is just as essential. (This is true for making new friends as well, by the way.)\nAn Autistic Social Butterfly\u2019s Guide to Making Friends\nInterpersonal skills for a proudly disabled life.medium.com\nOP, do you want to be in a relationship with someone who thinks you\u2019re more ignorant than you actually are? Do you find insecure men who lord their knowledge over you attractive? Do you like massaging people\u2019s egos? Does maintaining a charade for the rest of your life sound fulfilling or fun? Do you want to feel like your only way of drawing people toward you is by emulating some neurotypical caricature of womanhood?\nProbably not \u2014 at least not outside of some kind of consensual scenario where playing a role is part of the fun. But as the foundation for getting to know someone, faking personality traits is just going to burn up a ton of your masking energy and leave you feeling lonesome and not fully accepted.\nSo, if playing dumb and conforming to sexist standards isn\u2019t the right route, what should you do to get dates? The good news is that \u201cflirting\u201d isn\u2019t actually a unique skill set. You don\u2019t have to develop any special romantic charisma or game that will make people like you \u2014 forcing someone to like you is impossible. All you can do is create opportunities to meet people, and determine which of those people you\u2019d like to see again.\nRather than attempting to flirt, just practice starting conversations with people, ending conversations when you want them to end, and showing up to interactions as your real self. Stim openly and bounce in your seat. Speak and laugh in whatever weird guttural/robotic/cartoonish tone feels natural to you. Info dump about Bionicles, or YouTube beauty channel drama, or whatever gets you going. Listen intently to other people a roughly equal amount, while avoiding eye contact and ripping your napkin to shreds. Ask hyper-literal questions. Plug your ears when ambulances go by. Do the full Autistic works.\nAs long as you are respectful and reasonably pleasant, you\u2019re not gonna drive away anyone you\u2019d actually want to date. Besides, driving some people away is essential. It\u2019s not hard to get romantic attention from men. Showing up is 80% of the battle, and culling the herd down to people you actually enjoy being around is the remaining 20%.\nAdvice column readers love scripts, so here are a few examples of ways to convey interest:\n\u201cYour whole look caught my eye right away, I just had to say hi.

The right people will view it as part of the appeal of dating you. When you reject conventional \u201ccommon sense\u201d rules and choose to author the rules of your own life, anything can happen.

So of course, I always read and watch a lot of videos on new research surrounding diets like the ketogenic diet, intermittent fasting, paleo, and anything else that claims to be the key to optimizing our health.\nMost recently, I tried intermittent fasting for 7 days. To be fair, I\u2019m no licensed nutritionist and my diet was developed over my own research online. Here are some details on how I pursued it:\nWhen I Ate:\nThere are multiple ways to intermittent fast, and multiple levels of strictness and control, but basically I just skipped breakfast and dessert for a week, ate an early dinner, and focused on eating whole foods.\nWhat I Ate:\nWhile I mainly focused on the time frame of when I was eating, rather than what I was eating, I was still careful to incorporate lots of vegetables and protein to maximize \u201cfullness\u201d without overeating.\nTypical meal: Broccoli (boiled), 3 eggs, pan-roasted edamame with chili garlic and cumin, bread, hummus, and an apple, with lots of water.\nWhat Happened:\nFirst 24 Hours: I feel great! A little hungry before going to bed, but that\u2019s probably because I don\u2019t have dessert sitting in my stomach (I was used to treating myself to half a bar of dark chocolate, 250g, or recently, a piece of pineapple cake that my little sister sent me from Taiwan)\n72 Hours: I am finding that I am SCARFING down all of my meals, because I am so hungry. I would feel incredibly full after lunch or dinner, but find myself really hungry again after an hour. I consider that I am not eating enough calorie-dense foods. Will add more bread and butter to my meals. Generally, I feel pretty good about what I\u2019m doing and can see myself continuing this long-run with a few adjustments.\n5 Days: I am still hungry all of the time, even after adding more calorie-dense foods to my meals. I have a constant headache, feel groggy, and emotionally don\u2019t feel so good. I will go from feeling great to feeling really low, and am looking forward to the end of the week. I also find myself constantly thinking about food, even while I\u2019m eating.\n7 Days: Let this end.\nConclusion:\nThe verdict? It doesn\u2019t work and I absolutely hate it.\nI am no expert or scientist and I am just an amateur when it comes to food nutrition, so maybe I didn\u2019t do this diet perfectly as prescribed. But if you\u2019re experiencing these signs, I\u2019m thinking this diet is not sustainable in the long-run.\nHeadaches\nNegative emotions\nFatigue\nGrogginess\nThinking about food all of the time\n\nIn addition to intermittent fasting, I\u2019ve also tried other popular diet prescriptions with mixed results, with none of them being long-lasting or sustainable.\nSo what is the correct way to eat?\nHow do we take control of our diet and optimize our health and well-being for the long run? For years, I\u2019ve been following a single rule that has been a staple value in my house that I have found is the only one that works for me. It\u2019s not intermittent fasting, it\u2019s not keto, and it\u2019s not paleo. Not only has my single rule helped me lose weight, but it\u2019s improved my mood, energy, and overall well-being. It\u2019s something my mother had taught me, and the whole of Japan knows about it too. It\u2019s called: Harahachi-bunme\nWhat is Harahachi-bunme?\nBasically, if you tell any Japanese person that this is a kind of diet, they\u2019ll look at you in a very confused way, and correct you that it\u2019s not really. It\u2019s a long-standing Japanese saying that directly translates to \u201c8/10ths your stomach\u201d; meaning, you should only eat until you are 80% full.\nIt follows very simple principles that we should not overindulge in food, and we should be modest about how much we eat. Neither starving nor stuffing ourselves, it follows the principle that extreme lifestyles are neither good for us nor sustainable, and the key is finding balance and a middle ground to satisfy our needs.\nIt\u2019s a way of looking at food and hunger in an intuitive way, with a focus on nourishment and health rather than results like weight-loss or physical benchmarks. These benchmarks tend to come naturally over time anyways, because when you practice neither over-indulgent eating nor deprivation, your body will respond in a sustainable manner that will last you the rest of your life. You must trust that your body knows what it needs.\nA typical Japanese teishoku meal\nHow to practice Harahachi-bunme\nBasic guidelines behind the principle\nEat when you are hungry.\nFor some days this means eating two meals. For other days, it means eating four. Days following an intense day of exercise may mean you eat breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert, and snacks in-between. For a day of travel and lots of idle sitting, it could mean just one large meal and many snacks throughout the day.\nEat whole, nutrient-dense foods.\nWhile not strictly in the saying, harahachi-bunme only works when you are eating healthy, nutrient-dense foods. Your body cannot accurately measure nourishment and hunger when you are consuming mostly empty calories from highly-processed foods. These empty calories lead to overeating because you are never able to reach the point of \u201c80% full\u201d. Focus on fruits, vegetables, proteins, and whole grains, and your stomach and brain will respond accordingly to your needs.\nBy focusing on these kinds of foods, you will not only stop hunger pangs, but you will also lose the desire to mindlessly eat. Preventing overindulgence will not be a test of willpower, but will become a natural response.\nDon\u2019t worry about counting or measuring things \u2014 your body will know\nJust eat fruits, vegetables, proteins, and whole grains.\nIs it really that simple? Shouldn\u2019t you think about the composition of your macros? How about how these foods are cooked? Should it be raw or boiled or baked or pan-fried? This over-excessive thinking is what leads to extreme diets. Our bodies are thoughtful and well-run machines, and there is no need to obsessively consider these details. Trust your body, it will respond appropriately.\nTracking micro details won\u2019t really be sustainable in the long-run, unless you really enjoy dedicating mental energy to thinking about food in this sort of manner (and some people do!). For most of us though, just focus on consuming whole foods, limit your refined carbs, and your body will know the rest.\nStop when you\u2019re 80% full.\nThis is the most important part, as it guarantees how we develop a positive and sustainable relationship with food.\nThere are no concrete rules to how you will know when you\u2019re 80% full, but as a guideline, I like to eat slowly, and wait at least 30 minutes after eating a full meal to determine how I feel. Everyone has different lifestyles and body compositions, so it may be difficult to determine what this looks and feels like at first. But be patient, feel in tune with what your body is telling you, and if it\u2019s signaling hunger, eat. If it\u2019s telling you nothing, don\u2019t eat.\nGet food off your mind.\nAs you practice harahachi-bunme, the idea of food should fall to the back of your mind. Stop obsessing over it, and think of it as another part of enjoying a fulfilling life. Food should be a part of what makes life interesting and enjoyable, but should not be the focus. This practice is the most difficult part to attain, and it is the part which will take the most time, particularly if you\u2019ve had a problematic or complicated relationship with food in the past. But once you reach a point where it can fall back in your mind and take a backseat, your mental energy can be reallocated and opened to many more interesting life experiences and ideas that aren\u2019t related to diet.\nWith this perspective shift and change in relationship with food, living will not be about eating, but eating will become the fuel and sustenance for a fulfilling lifestyle, focused on your family, friends, career, and success.\nHarahachi-bunme is not really a diet, and to be honest, it\u2019s not even really a rule. It\u2019s a way of intuitive eating and understanding food from a perspective of nourishment and sustenance.\nI\u2019ve gone from both ends of the extreme eating spectrum, and found that I was neither happy nor productive in either state. Moderation can be a lot more difficult than said, but once you master the art of it, your brain capacity really does open up for better things.\nSo get in touch with your thoughts, and get in touch with your body. Love it, nourish it, and treasure it. You will feel physically better, emotionally happier, and psychologically more engaged with your work and the people around you.\n\n\n", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 13461, "created_time": 1558069556663, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Health", "Diet", "Wellbeing", "Nutrition", "Food"]}, {"author": "Kaki Okumura", "post_id": "aca71f960e8b", "user_id": "e4dc035a1f32", "title": "The Japanese Character for Rest Helped Me Find It", "content": "The Japanese Character for Rest Helped Me Find It\nHow to find real rest and relaxation\nIllustrations by Kaki Okumura\nWhen you imagine someone resting, what do you visualize? Perhaps you would describe a person on the couch, or a person curled up under the covers in bed. Maybe you\u2019d imagine a person lounging in a hammock, or suntanning on the beach.\nIf you were to ask a Japanese person, they would probably describe rest as a person leaning against a tree.\n\u4eba\uff1aperson\n\u6728\uff1atree\n\u4f11\uff1arest\nThe Japanese character for rest is the combination of \u2018person\u2019 and \u2018tree\u2019. It\u2019s a universal image, the person leaning against the tree to rest\u2013 a representation of rest as not simply sleep or the absence of work, but it\u2019s about being in a safe place, a place where we can feel peace.\n\nRecent work-from-home set-ups have tempted many of us to blend our environments\u2013 to eat where we work or work where we sleep\u2013but this sort of blending of environments has made places that are traditionally designed for rest into spaces that aren\u2019t conducive to finding peace.\nWhen we see our work laptop we are reminded of our unread emails, and when we see the stack of mail in the corner we are reminded of our unpaid bills. It doesn\u2019t matter if there is urgency to these responsibilities or not, but their presence can make simple events that should be relaxing\u2013such as enjoying a meal at the kitchen table\u2013 something quite difficult to enjoy.\nIn a similar vein, when we see the dirty dishes and empty cups slowly stacking on our bedside table, or documents and papers strewn across our bed comforter, it becomes very hard to fall asleep in bed. It reminds us that we have dishes to clean, or that we have work that is unfinished, and suddenly the space we turned to for comfort does not feel as safe anymore.\nJapanese imagery of rest showed me that the rest isn\u2019t found in a vacuum, that we can\u2019t just close our eyes and put in our earplugs if we want to find real rest. What we really need to feel is safe from the distractions of life; we need to be under our tree.\n\nSo the next time you have difficulty falling asleep, or find that you\u2019re lying on the couch but not quite allowing yourself to feel well-rested, try thinking about the presences surrounding you. What is in your immediate vicinity? What influences is it having on your sense of safety?\nThese small details might seem negligible, but the unconscious mind takes note of these stresses\u2013 and you may find that by simply putting them away that finding a sense of relief and rest becomes much easier to find.\n\nLearn to be healthier, inspired by life in Japan:\nI teach about health inspired by simple Japanese philosophies and lifestyle practices, so you can learn to find peace, fulfillment, strength, and health in your own body.

This makes us tired of taking care of our health, sometimes tired enough to make us want to give up.\nBut we don\u2019t need to feel like we are held prisoner by our own bodies, a freedom we can find when we understand change not as something to fear, but something we can accept.\n\nOne of the cornerstones of Japanese Zen Buddhism is the idea of accepting impermanence, that nothing in our lives can be grasped or held onto\u2013 the good, the bad, the exciting, and the boring.\nEverything is constantly changing whether we seek it or not, and we only need to pay attention to the changing seasons to understand why: the fleeting nature of it is why the emergence of spring can feel so joyous, or the onset of autumn can feel so calming.

(And yes, it\u2019s been another week of distracting news on all kinds of other fronts.) The headlines on DC federal district judge James Boasberg\u2019s decision to allow the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s antitrust case against Facebook to go forward were all accurate, to be sure. In the judge\u2019s view, the commission has met the evidentiary bar in its claim that the company has a monopoly level of dominance in the personal social networking space, and that dominance may plausibly be harming consumers. Most of the media emphasized the first point about Meta\u2019s monopolistic moves, since the company has tried to argue that it has several strong competitors. (Given all we now know about how platforms like Facebook and Instagram hurt teens, to take just one example, the consumer harm argument should be less disputed.)\nWhat they didn\u2019t emphasize enough was this one sentence in Boasberg\u2019s ruling: \u201cAlthough the agency may well face a tall task down the road in proving its allegations, the Court believes that it has now cleared the pleading bar and may proceed to discovery.\u201d\nGetting to discovery matters because of how much evidence the FTC already has of Facebook\u2019s malign behavior as well as the compelling theory of the case that the agency has already articulated. To recap, back in December of 2020, the FTC sued Facebook on antitrust grounds but last summer Boasberg rejected its original complaint for lacking sufficient evidence. The FTC then amended its complaint, and the arguments it marshaled there are fearsome. In its original suit, the agency had already disclosed a 2008 internal email from Zuckerberg stating that \u201cit is better to buy than to compete.\u201d But what the FTC laid out in its amended complaint is a very plausible and damning narrative for why he then chose to buy a series of rising competitors, burying some and, in the cases of Instagram and WhatsApp, turning them into core products while killing off his own internal efforts to compete with them.\nThe key thing to remember about Facebook\u2019s move to monopoly is how the web was changing between 2009 and 2012 and how much that threatened the company. Mobile was starting to displace desktop as the main way people went online, and Facebook\u2019s core service (internally known as Facebook Blue) didn\u2019t function well on smartphones. Zuckerberg\u2019s first attempt at rewriting its code for mobile was a failure, the FTC\u2019s suit recounts. He was worried that new apps that were mobile native, especially those that were well-suited to the way smartphones double as text- and photo-sharing tools, could challenge his dominance. Instagram, which exploded in usage in 2010, was a major threat.\nAt first, Zuck tried to compete. But by September 2011 he wrote, in an internal email cited in the FTC\u2019s amended complaint, \u201cIn the time it has taken us to get ou[r] act together on this[,] Instagram has become a large and viable competitor to us on mobile photos, which will increasingly be the future of photos.\u201d He added, \u201cIf Instagram continues to kick ass on mobile or if Google buys them, then over the next few years they could easily add pieces of their service that copy what we\u2019re doing now, and if they have a growing number of people\u2019s photos then that\u2019s a real issue for us. They\u2019re growing extremely quickly right now. It seems like they double every couple of months or so, and their base is already -5\u201310m users. \u2026But at the current rate, literally every couple of months that we waste translates to a double in their growth and a harder position for us to work our way out of.\u201d\nSoon, monopoly became the obvious way out. In a February 2012 internal email advocating the acquisition of Instagram, he wrote, \u201cOne thing that may make [neutralizing a potential competitor] more reasonable here is that there are network effects around social products and a finite number of different social mechanics to invent. Once someone wins at a specific mechanic, it\u2019s difficult for others to supplant them without doing something different. It\u2019s possible someone beats Instagram by building something that is better to the point that they get network migration, but this is harder as long as Instagram keeps running as a product.\u201d He added, \u201c[O]ne way of looking at this is that what we\u2019re really buying is time. Even if some new competitors spring[] up, buying Instagram, Path, Foursquare, etc now will give us a year or more to integrate their dynamics before anyone can get close to their scale again. Within that time, if we incorporate the social mechanics they were using, those new products won\u2019t get much traction since we\u2019ll already have their mechanics deployed at scale.\u201d\nYou have to give Zuckerberg credit for thinking clearly about how the web was developing. At a time when many of us were in thrall to the potential of the open web to enable human collaboration, he already understood that his company\u2019s only hope for survival as a walled garden was in either defeating or absorbing threatening newcomers offering better social tools. In February 2012, he wrote of Instagram, \u201cI think it\u2019s quite possible that our initial thesis was wrong and that theirs is right \u2014 that what people want is more to take the best photos than to put them on FB. If so, [Facebook] Snap might be a good first step but we\u2019d be very behind in both functionality and brand on how one of the core use cases of Facebook will evolve in the mobile world, which is really scary and why we might want to consider paying a lot of money for this.\u201d Two months later, he bought Instagram for $1 billion and then cut his team\u2019s own efforts to make a photo-sharing app.\nThe FTC amended complaint offers similar inside details about Zuckerberg\u2019s decision to buy WhatsApp. Facebook Messenger was created to compete with the messaging app, but Zuck knew that it was not as good, writing in April 2012, \u201cRight now, aside from Facebook integration, WhatsApp is legitimately a better product for mobile messaging than even our standalone Messenger app. It\u2019s more reliable and faster for sending messages. You get better signal and feedback via read receipts and last seen times. You can even reach most people easily via the contacts integration.\u201d He added, \u201c[I]\u2019m the most worried about messaging. WhatsApp is already ahead of us in messaging in the same way Instagram was \u2018ahead\u2019 of us in photos.\u201d He added: \u201cI\u2019d pay $1b for them if we could get them.\u201d Two years later he paid a whopping $19 billion.\nFacebook\u2019s flacks have tried to play down the importance of the DC court\u2019s latest ruling. \u201cToday\u2019s decision narrows the scope of the FTC\u2019s case by rejecting claims about our platform policies. It also acknowledges that the agency faces a \u2018tall task\u2019 proving its case regarding two acquisitions it cleared years ago,\u201d a spokesperson said. While both of these claims are true in the narrow sense \u2014 Judge Boasberg did set aside the FTC\u2019s claim that Facebook Platform was being deployed in a monopolistic manner because it stopped that practice a few years ago, and he did use the words \u2018tall task\u2019 \u2014 they amount to whistling past the graveyard. If Facebook thinks it can win in court with these arguments it needs new lawyers.\nIn the meantime, getting to discovery means the FTC\u2019s lawyers will now be able to probe even further inside Facebook. And there\u2019s a small army of ex-Facebook employees who undoubtedly know where more damning documents and emails may be buried. It may still take years, but the idea that the government will break up Facebook on antitrust grounds is no longer unrealistic.", "comment_count": 2, "like_count": 214, "created_time": 1642176482752, "comment": [{"user_id": "3ec8c288d183", "comment_time": 1642176482752, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "9e6df1fc7136", "comment_time": 1642352472773, "comment": "https://medium.com/@santoevaristocosmosmartins/aoutor-me-c0d3643248be"}, {"user_id": "c53f83cff180", "comment_time": 1647094584501, "comment": "Would be a shame to break up a great company merely for doing what all big tech does."}], "post_tag": ["Facebook", "Monopoly", "Antitrust", "Instagram", "WhatsApp"]}, {"author": "Micah Sifry", "post_id": "de38359a3f86", "user_id": "3ec8c288d183", "title": "How CNN Shills for War", "content": "How CNN Shills for War\nLetting lobbyists for military contractors like William Cohen opine as if they are objective experts, that\u2019s how.\n\nI don\u2019t watch a lot of cable news, mostly because it just makes me agitated. At night, most of the coverage isn\u2019t really news but opinion and entertainment delivered as news. So instead of learning from people who actually know something about the events being covered, the cable programs center on anchors who are mostly skilled at emoting, building a connection with their viewers, and guests who help narrate whatever spectacle we are being offered to draw our attention. (Well, maybe Chris Hayes is an exception.)\nBut cable news still has a big impact on public opinion, because the people who watch think they\u2019re well informed, and they influence their friends and colleagues are influenced. So even if the viewing audience for CNN, MSNBC and FOX is only around six million people total at the height of prime time, what those programs emphasize has outsize influence on public opinion.\nA few nights ago, I looked at CNN for a few minutes and caught Jake Tapper, standing in the 4:00am dark somewhere in Ukraine, interviewing William Cohen, the former US Secretary of Defense. Cohen is certainly the kind of knowledgeable talking head you\u2019d want to hear from in the middle of the Ukraine crisis, so I listened for a bit. Cohen was arguing that it was time for the United States and NATO to escalate their efforts to defend Ukraine and that it was time to stop letting our fear of tripping into a shooting war with Russia keep us from taking more aggressive steps. Russia isn\u2019t abiding by any rules, while we are, he complained. It\u2019s time for the US and NATO to stop letting Russia push us around, he intimated.\nCohen is on TV a lot these days, and he\u2019s not the person being moved by the news of the horrible atrocities being carried out by Russian forces. No sensible person thinks it\u2019s a good idea to led Vladimir Putin invade another sovereign country, commit war crimes, and get off scot-free. But there are also good reasons for us to be extraordinarily cautious about directly confronting Russian forces with the full power available to NATO. As I\u2019ve written here earlier, under Putin Russia has embraced a military doctrine called \u201cescalate to de-escalate\u201d and would use low-yield nuclear weapons to try to push its adversaries into an abrupt half if its leadership believes the security of Russia itself was endangered. None of us know where Putin sees that line, but backing him into a corner where he sees no other way out is not wise.\nAs I listened to Cohen make his case, I wondered, what does he do for a living? The last time he served in government was from 1997\u20132001, he was Bill Clinton\u2019s Defense Secretary and the token Republican moderate in an otherwise Democratic administration. His Wikipedia entry describes him as an \u201cAmerican politician, lawyer and author.\u201d It\u2019s only when you scroll down to the \u201crecent years\u201d section of his biography that you learn that in 2001, he founded a lobbying firm called The Cohen Group, along with three other former Pentagon colleagues. What does the Cohen Group do? Its website is vague: \u201cThe Cohen Group provides global business consulting services and advice on tactical and strategic opportunities in virtually every market.\u201d\nYou have to dig further to really know how Cohen makes his living. Deep on its website, its Aerospace and Defense practice group declares, \u201cThe Cohen Group (TCG) assists aerospace and defense firms on policy, business development and transactions. We have helped firms from the US, Canada, UK, Europe, Turkey, Israel, GCC, India, Southeast Asia, and Japan to succeed in North America, Europe, the Middle East, India, Latin America, East Asia, and Southeast Asia. TCG has assisted clients to compete for and win tens of billions of dollars in contracts, to enter new international markets, to build joint venture and other partnerships overseas, and to move up the supply chain.\u201d It\u2019s the only section of the company\u2019s site that refers to big money, in the form of \u201ctens of billions in contracts\u201d won for its clients.\nWho are The Cohen Group\u2019s clients? Its website doesn\u2019t say. The only window we have on what this shadowy lobbying firm actually does is the public financial disclosure reports that some of its employees have been required to file when they\u2019ve taken jobs in the executive branch. Thus we can learn that Nicholas Burns, who was made US Ambassador to China by President Biden, worked as a \u201csenior counselor\u201d for The Cohen Group from 2009 to 2021, earning $415,000 in consulting fees while there assisting clients that included General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin, and Honeywell \u2014 the three giant military contractors that are at the heart of the \u201cdefense industrial base\u201d of the United States.\nHelping defense contractors keep feasting on the public treasury has been very lucrative for William Cohen. According to a 2006 Washington Post profile, the former baker\u2019s son from Bangor, Maine was never wealthy before he left government service. His final public disclosure filing from 2001 showed tens of thousands of charge-account debts owed at interest rates as high as 25%. But, \u201cWithin weeks of leaving office, he was living in a $3.5 million McLean mansion with a swimming pool, a cabana and a carriage house.\u201d\nOne fun thing about that 2006 profile is when it describes how a client of Cohen\u2019s, Raydon Corp, which makes training simulators for the military, came to hire the firm. Don Ariel, its CEO, was looking for help marketing his products \u201cwhen saw Cohen on CNN and called him.\u201d Cohen\u2019s team helped get Raydon meetings demoing its product on Capitol Hill, leading to millions of dollars for the equipment in 2005 defense appropriations. \u201cThere is a reason that they hire Hollywood stars to shill various pieces of equipment or products,\u201d Ariel told the Post. \u201cAnd certainly somebody with the name recognition of a Bill Cohen . . . there is instant brand recognition and credibility that comes along with that.\u201d Raydon paid Cohen\u2019s firm $625,000 in lobbying fees for its services.\nWilliam Cohen is not the only former Pentagon official to cash in on his service to his country. Nor is he the first ex-military official to go on TV promoting war. A whole platoon of war hawks who helped sell George W. Bush\u2019s idiotic decision to invade Iraq. And a 2008 investigation by the New York Times found that the Pentagon had a sophisticated multi-year effort aimed as massaging American public opinion by providing ex-military official appearing on TV news shows with in-depth briefings and talking points. The Times found that \u201cInternal Pentagon documents repeatedly refer to the military analysts as \u2018message force multipliers\u2019 or \u2018surrogates\u2019 who could be counted on to deliver administration \u2018themes and messages\u2019 to millions of Americans \u2018in the form of their own opinions.\u2019\u201d\nSo the next time you see William Cohen or any of his ilk on cable TV opining about the war in Ukraine, or China, or any other international conflict, remember: He\u2019s not just talking for himself as an ex-government official who knows something about the defense sector. He\u2019s in the business of selling weapons, and nothing is as good for that business as war.", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 1, "created_time": 1650037855508, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Ukraine", "Lobbying", "Nato", "Cnn", "Pentagon"]}, {"author": "Micah Sifry", "post_id": "c46910ad75d8", "user_id": "3ec8c288d183", "title": "Can Tech Strengthen Civil Society Now?", "content": "Can Tech Strengthen Civil Society Now?\nWhy aren\u2019t there more Wikipedia-scale successes online?\nThe NY Public Library Manhattan main branch, inside Planet Minecraft\nOn Monday night, I participated in a class session of Technology, Media & Democracy, a partnership of five academic institutions in New York City, co-taught by Justin Hendrix, combining two classes he runs at NYU and Cornell Tech, David Carroll at The New School, Douglas Rushkoff at CUNY Queens College, and Emily Bell at Columbia Journalism. Alongside me as speakers were Rebecca MacKinnon of the Wikimedia Foundation and Eli Pariser of New_ Public.\nRushkoff sent us some questions in advance, which got me thinking. In essence, he asked us to consider the challenges facing democracy today, to weigh how much tech has contributed to those challenges (as opposed to simply reflecting the complexities and crises already present in society), and to offer thoughts on how to strengthen the public sphere and knowledge-building institutions going forward. In particular, since the students taking this course are all considering careers in civic tech, he asked, \u201cWe had 10+ years of designing better \u2018public tech\u2019 and public spheres, from Planetary to gobo.social to Diaspora to consider.it. Yet, we have not seen anything break through apart from Wikipedia \u2014 is that the case, what might be the key challenge, and are you still optimistic? What promising emerging platforms are you seeing? So much of our discussions are trimming around the edges, but how can we drill down to a core animating issue? Do we have to design for inequality and anti-grift? Do we need to design the internet for the real world, not the techno-utopian vision?\u201d\nIn other words, can tech help strengthen civil society now? Here\u2019s what I jotted down in response.\nFor starters, I think we need to recognize what moment in the technological cycle we are living in. In The Master Switch, Tim Wu describes how each major innovation in the technology of communication has first disrupted the previous information empire, and then a new empire has consolidated itself. From the invention of the telegraph, radio, television, and now the internet, there\u2019s a recurrent pattern: A newer, more powerful, and cheaper means of communicating gets invented; the means of communication temporarily spread into many more hands; and then capital consolidates and reconcentrates the system. We\u2019re in the middle of the last part of that triptych now, with giants like Google, Meta, Amazon, Comcast and Verizon dominating and making it quite difficult for any insurgent project to connect at scale.\nIf Jimmy Wales tried to launch Wikipedia today, it would fail. That isn\u2019t because the \u201ccognitive surplus\u201d that writers like Yochai Benkler and Clay Shirky so eloquently described a decade ago has disappeared. Until the open Internet, the idea of an open online encyclopedia that anyone could edit was an impossibility. In 2010, Shirky estimated that it took about 100 million hours of human attention to build Wikipedia, a mere fraction of the 200 billion hours of TV Americans watched that year. If we shifted just five percent of our attention toward collaborative efforts, we could build 100 more Wikipedia-scale projects, he argued.\nWe\u2019ve absolutely seen an expansion of people connecting and collaborating with each other since the internet became ubiquitous. But most of that activity has been captured by the monetizing processes of surveillance capitalism. In January 2001, when Wales and his partner Larry Sanger launched the online encyclopedia that anyone could edit, the web was tiny, with fewer than 30 million websites. Today there are around two billion, and that\u2019s not counting the billions of individual pages that users have on the big platforms. No one would notice a public-spirited project like Wikipedia if it were starting now.\nWhat changed between the launch of Wikipedia and today is a handful of empire-builders like Eric Schmidt, Mark Zuckerberg, Jack Dorsey, Reid Hoffman and Jeff Bezos figured out how to capture the bulk of that social energy on their platforms (respectively, Google, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and Amazon), while a laissez-faire libertarian way of thinking dominated government\u2019s approach to regulating the new digital economy. Don\u2019t forget, it was neoliberal Democrats like Bill Clinton and Al Gore who privatized the early Internet, and then the neoliberal Barack Obama who lionized the rising tech moguls of Google and Facebook while he was in power. So while there is a cognitive surplus to be channeled towards creating civic goods, most of it currently being farmed on the big tech <strike>plantations</strike> platforms.\nBut people who want to use tech to strengthen civil society have another problem. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average person reports having about five and a half hours of leisure per day. Three-quarters of that time is spent watching TV or on a computer. Americans spend just about nine minutes, averaged across all of us, in civic or volunteer activity. Eitan Hersh surveyed Americans in 2018 and found that most daily news consumers report belonging to zero organizations. In his terrific book, Politics is for Power, he wrote, \u201cSixty-five percent report that in the last year they have done no work with other people to solve a community problem. Sixty-eight percent say they have attended zero meetings in the last year about a community issue.\u201d Keep in mind that most people tell pollsters they are more active than they actually are.\nWorst of all, people think that consuming news and sharing on social media equals being politically active. One-third of all Americans say they spend two hours a day on politics, Hersh found in that 2018 survey. But 80 percent of those people report that time is spent spectating, consuming news and social media, and sharing content with others. Hersh calls those people \u201cpolitical hobbyists\u201d and he damns them, pungently. People who sign petitions online do so as a form of \u201cself-gratification,\u201d he writes. \u201cWe click and post and share not to take a civic action \u2026 [but] to convey an image to our social networks and ourselves.\u201d\nThis is all because the winners of the game of platform consolidation solved for what would most quickly allow them to colonize our attention, not what would be best for their users\u2019 health or the health of the larger society. And they did that because under our current system of financialized capitalism, the rewards go to the fastest exploiters. So, to sum up, I don\u2019t think we now need to redesign the Internet, I think we need to change the real world. Which means first, strengthening laws, structures and organizations that aggregate people power and weakening those that aggregate the power of capital.\nCan we do that? Sure! Right now there is legislation moving forward in Congress that would begin to rein in the monopolistic powers of Big Tech and start to make room for fresh competition. The American Innovation and Choice Online Act (S.2992/H.R.3816) would stop dominant Big Tech platforms from anticompetitive discrimination, self-preferencing, and excluding competitors to protect their monopolies and leverage them into other lines of business. And the Open App Markets Act (S.2710/H.R.7030) would prevent the big app stores from using their gatekeeping power to require app developers to use a specific in-app payment system or from unfairly promoting their own apps above those of competing app developers.\nThese are just a start. We need to open up more choices for consumers to access affordable high-speed broadband. And we also need to restore the conditions that made the open internet such a generative place, by requiring \u201cadversarial interoperability\u201d between big platforms, which would allow users to move from one service to another without losing their data (or their friends). If you can switch phone carriers without losing your ability to call your Mom, why can\u2019t you do that with your social network?\nBreaking up the big tech monopolies in these ways would allow for a lot of the social energy now being farmed inside their walled gardens to move more freely, but a generation of bad habits formed around \u201cgoing viral\u201d and getting endorphin hits from \u201clikes\u201d won\u2019t change overnight. Our civic muscles have been badly deformed by a generation of Big Tech dominance, and right now we are much better at clustering with the people we already agree with and shouting at the people we disagree with than finding consensus. On top of that, I could write a whole other essay about the relationship between \u201ccheap\u201d fossil fuel energy, rare minerals, and the ways we take ubiquitous smartphone connectivity for granted. If we\u2019re going to find our way toward a healthier role for tech in civic life, we\u2019re going to also have to figure out how use it sustainably. Two generations ago, there was a whole movement around the concept of \u201cappropriate technology.\u201d Perhaps it\u2019s time for a fresh look.", "comment_count": 3, "like_count": 115, "created_time": 1649859657896, "comment": [{"user_id": "3ec8c288d183", "comment_time": 1649859657896, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "333abc6554e7", "comment_time": 1650033252942, "comment": "Fabulous job Micah!

It took 90 minutes to make it down the West Side Highway to the George Washington Bridge and through the never-ending traffic of the New Jersey Turnpike until I reached the exit for the Goethals Bridge to Staten Island. I fretted about getting lost and missing the event, but as my car reached the top of the bridge, which rises several hundred feet over the pipelines, container terminals and wetlands that riddle the border between Elizabeth, New Jersey and the northwest corner of Staten Island, I saw down below four massive structures, each the length of a dozen football fields, dominating the otherwise green landscape. There was no missing the JFK8 Amazon warehouse, or its sister monoliths the LDJ5 Amazon sort center, the DYY6 Amazon delivery station or the vast parking garage serving their thousands of workers. Behemoth was the only word that came to mind. The one road from the exit turnoff led straight there.\nJFK8 Amazon warehouse (Photo by Micah L.

This was the ALU organizers press conference. These were the Davids and Davidas who had taken on a Goliath and lived to celebrate the day.\nAs press conferences go, this one was pretty untraditional. Instead of two or three speakers reading statements and taking questions, ALU interim president Chris Smalls invited more than a dozen worker-organizers to share their stories for more than an hour. The crowd curled around them listening was a mix of mainstream and left/labor press along with a lot of supporters of the budding union, many wearing ALU shirts or other labor insignia. One young person in the audience wore a Bernie Sanders 2020 T-shirt; another was in a Wu-Tang Clan shirt. A constant stream of cars and trucks flowed past in both directions, many of them leaning on their horns or rolling down their windows to shout \u201cALU all the way\u201d as they came by.\nI listened with one ear to the speakers and my eyes on the whole scene. Here\u2019s what I noticed.\n\u2014 The COVID crisis was the catalyst for the personal transformations that turned workers who originally put their faith in Amazon management into people who not only lost their faith but lost their fear, and staked their lives on each other instead. When Chris Smalls was fired after organizing a walkout to protest the lack of proper COVID safety measures inside the warehouse, Derrick Palmer, his friend and the union\u2019s interim VP, said of himself, \u201ca new man was birthed that day.\u201d Another union member talked about how, after another died of COVID, there was no memorial inside the warehouse or even mention of the loss.\n\u2014 Amazon\u2019s own heavy-handed efforts to defeat the organizing effort helped it instead. One union member recounted being told by a union buster that Smalls drove a Lamborghini, a plain lie about someone who basically lived out his car for eleven months during the organizing drive. Pasquale Cioffi, an older Italian man who got involved in the final weeks of the organizing drive told me seeing management\u2019s insulting treatment of Smalls, Palmer and some of their fellow organizers was what tipped him over. \u201cIt was game on from there.\u201d A former longshoreman before he came to JFK8, he said he personally flipped 400\u2013500 workers from No to Yes votes. \u201cI\u2019m the one guy you don\u2019t want to piss off,\u201d he bragged.\nPasquale Cioffi (Photo by Micah L. Sifry, all rights reserved)\n\u2014 People have been pushed too far by Amazon\u2019s hypermodern management methods. Being docked an hour\u2019s pay for being a few minutes late was the most relatable example; one older woman I spoke to mentioned that her \u201calgorithm\u201d had mistakenly put her on job probation for infractions as small as a count being off by one unit. \u201cI\u2019ve been here three and a half years,\u201d she said, \u201cshould I get written up and have my career at risk for that?\u201d At least three speakers, all Black men, spoke about work inside the warehouse as being like on a southern plantation picking cotton. \u201cIt\u2019s a slave system in there,\u201d Gerald Bryson, one of the ALU\u2019s co-founders said.\nhttps://twitter.com/rlgumpert/status/1508089747289219082\n\u2014 The old labor traditions have found another lease on life. I was touched when a young Jamaican man joined with a young white woman to sing a reggae-tinged song with words like \u201cWhat\u2019s that I see a\u2019coming? A union\u2019s a coming.\u201d Many of the ALU members around them joined in. I was also startled to hear one speaker comment that Amazon management used the police of the nearby 120th precinct \u201clike their own Pinkertons or something.\u201d Only someone who has read up on labor history would know what the Pinkertons were.\n\u2014 Salts, or people who came from elsewhere to get a job in the warehouse in order to help organize it, were an important factor in the fight. Several of the people who spoke mentioned moving from across the country from places like Arizona and Florida in response to call from Chris Smalls to help out. And the budding union needs more of them. When I asked Derrick Palmer, its VP, for a list of what the ALU needs now, his key item was \u201corganizers who are Amazon workers.\u201d And as the event closed, Chris Smalls said the same thing from the stage: \u201cIf you need a job, get a job and help us organize from within.\u201d\n\u2014 There was a lot of youth and idealism on display, but behind it I also sensed fierce ideological commitment. Brett Daniels, a white ALU organizer from Arizona with blond buzz-cut hair and a hammer-and-sickle in his Twitter profile, talked proudly about how the ALU\u2019s precursor group, The Congress of Essential Workers, was founded on May 1, 2020, or \u201cMayDay, a revolutionary international day for workers.\u201d He added, \u201cThat\u2019s when I decided to salt.\u201d He ended his time at the mic with \u201call power to the people,\u201d an old Black Panther slogan. Several people in the crowd chanted it back at him, raising their fists.\n\u2014 The union spoke the workers\u2019 languages. Brima Sylla, a 55-year-old Liberian immigrant who led the ALU\u2019s efforts to reach immigrant workers, who make up about half the warehouse workforce, said he personally speaks seven languages and made sure the union\u2019s materials were translated into all of them. Interestingly, he was the one speaker who framed his pitch for the union not in the class struggle terms favored by most, but as a way to fix Amazon and make it better. \u201cWe are not the problems, we are the solutions,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a lot of ideas to improve the company.\u201d\nOf course, a lot of those ideas are things that are anathema to Jeff Bezos and the ruthless productivity machine he has built. Giving people higher pay, longer breaks and better working conditions will no doubt reduce how many people are injured in Amazon\u2019s warehouses or quit because they can\u2019t take the physical and psychological intensity of the work, but if reducing turnover was Amazon\u2019s business model it would have done those things already.\nThe union has another big test in two weeks at the smaller LDJ5 sort center, which employs about 1,800. None of the ALU speakers seemed cocky about winning there. But for a group that, according to Smalls, had just $3 in its account three weeks ago, the ALU\u2019s path can only go up. (Donate here if you want to support them.) Workers at more than one hundred other Amazon locations have contacted the union since its April 1 victory, Smalls reported, and \u201cour phone have literally not stopped buzzing since we won.\u201d He wants the workers at other warehouses to learn from the Staten Island experience and take their time to build a core group of organizers and hold hundreds of one-on-one conversations before any try to surface and petition for recognition.\nSo whatever happens at LDJ5, the ALU isn\u2019t going to disappear. Amazon\u2019s own greed and hyper-management helped build this union as much as the independent organizers who convinced 2,654 of their colleagues that it was time to fight back for their own lives and dignity. A fire has been lit. Now the knowledge of how to do so is spreading.\np.s. Here\u2019s my weekly newsletter, The Connector, which focused on the ALU in this week\u2019s edition.

Photo: Raj Rana/Unsplash\nI have several jobs, and one of them is \u201clowly adjunct\u201d in the graduate school of journalism at NYU, where I teach a class about digital media innovation. As part of the course, my students have to conceptualize and prototype a new media product that could be used in a journalistic or newsroom context. Its innovation might be technical, journalistic, or a new business model. The class is very entrepreneurial and involves hard business skills, but my Twitter bio just says \u201cNYU j-school prof,\u201d so people on the right who don\u2019t like my politics periodically accuse me of indoctrinating journalism students into leftist groupthink or some form of Marxism that isn\u2019t recognizable to anyone who\u2019s read Marx. \u201cCommie\u201d has been invoked more than once.\nAs I said to one such correspondent, all of whom tend to disparage my intelligence in grammatically inexplicable ways, I don\u2019t teach students how to do political reporting or even how to write political op-eds, which I do myself (for a living, even!). I teach them how to put together a P&L, how to determine what their minimum viable product is, how to prototype it, how to test their business models, and so on. Partisan discussions of what is and isn\u2019t happening in the U.S. electoral cycle don\u2019t really come up. And I find that Republicans approach media company valuations pretty much the same way Democrats do; some things are just not partisan.\nBut I would be lying if I said discussions were never political. And here I think it\u2019s important to distinguish between partisanship and politics as a broader concept. The program I teach in attracts a lot of international students, and it\u2019s very diverse, so students naturally want to know how U.S. newsrooms and media companies are structured and who has power in them. Who are the decision-makers? Are they white? Are they men? How old are they? Where did they go to school? These are inherently political questions because at base, politics is not defined by partisanship. Politics is about who has power and who doesn\u2019t. And in America, those questions do align with particular partisan leanings but also exist and affect people whether they have strong partisan feelings or not.\nThere will only be fun in the company Slack! This is what fun looks like!\nA few weeks ago, Basecamp set fire to itself by demanding that employees keep their politics and societal discussions out of the workplace Slack, seemingly in response to organizational efforts by employees to ramp up diversity and inclusion efforts. Co-founder Jason Fried claimed that these discussions were a distraction and were reducing productivity. A third of the staff disagreed and quit.\nThe \u2018Pyramid of Hate\u2019 that Brought Down Basecamp\nBasecamp bosses banned politics at work over a social justice diagrammarker.medium.com\nI wouldn\u2019t argue that Slack discussions never reduce productivity, but tech companies tend to be very metrics-driven, and it should be relatively easy to determine who\u2019s underperforming, and Fried\u2019s letter seems to insinuate that everyone was. And I find it hard to believe that everyone participating in company-wide discussions about diversity was somehow less productive for it or that questions of power that are directly relevant to an employee\u2019s status at the company are to be avoided on a productivity basis.\nBut it doesn\u2019t matter because workplaces are inherently political whether Fried (or anybody else) likes it or not. There are always power dynamics that determine how institutions operate, and in many cases, the marginalized parties look nothing like the managerial class. This is particularly true in the upper echelons of tech, where founders skew white and male and often wield degrees from elite schools.\nAnd these power considerations apply not just to corporate structure and who gets to make decisions but also to how products get made. In my other life as a political messaging consultant, I\u2019ve worked on attempts to ban software that the NYPD uses to identify potential gang members. The software routinely flags innocent people because racist assumptions are built into its algorithm. Black patients have been denied the health care they need because widely used decision-making software is more likely to refer white patients for customized care programs than Black patients. These are high-stakes situations where the construction of the product and its obvious flaws are partly a function of who\u2019s building the product and making key decisions and what their own experiences of these scenarios are.\nSometimes the stakes are lower, but the design flaws are just as apparent: The first few times I did immersive VR, I was thrilled by it and also nauseated \u2014 literally. Sometimes nausea in VR is a function of frame speed: If it\u2019s too slow, your brain thinks you\u2019re being poisoned. But part of it, too, is that I\u2019m a woman, and we tend to calculate distance differently than men do (shape from shading vs. motion parallax). VR companies know this now, but in 2015 or so, no one had bothered to write the user story that says, \u201cI\u2019m a woman, and I would like to do anything at all in an immersive experience without puking.\u201d\nHere\u2019s another user story you never see: \u201cI\u2019m a bigoted asshole, and I want to make someone else\u2019s life hell.\u201d I thought about that one when Slack rolled out its ability to DM anyone regardless of whether they\u2019re in the network. To its credit, it rolled it back, but I think this problem could have been avoided had Slack talked to even one woman who\u2019s spent any time online and been on the receiving end of unsolicited messages.\nAt any rate, these issues, which seem very relevant to things like, oh, the success of the enterprise, could always be construed as political \u2014 because they are to some extent. That doesn\u2019t make them unreasonable or irrelevant.\nThe corporate ban on political conversations at work hurts trans identities\nor Actually my pronouns aren\u2019t political thanks.ctrlaltcookie.medium.com\nI do not believe in the idea of bringing your whole self to work. Mostly because I\u2019m a late Gen Xer/xennial who knows the institution\u2019s not gonna love you back and the co-founders are always more invested, literally, than you are. In my experience, any company that demands you bring 110% of yourself to the office and basically live there is also a company that will not evaluate you using rational metrics nor tolerate any part of that 110% that is inconvenient for management.\nBut I also don\u2019t believe it\u2019s possible for a company operating in the United States of America in 2021 to be apolitical. When Coinbase says it is, what it means is that its employees will trade not being able to assert their power or concerns in a corporate situation for more money or more upside.\nAnd compensating people for a subpar work culture isn\u2019t unusual or new. Look at investment banking, which works analysts to death while promising them astronomical earning power. People tolerate the abuse because they want what they believe the money will afford them.\nWhich brings us back to Coinbase and Basecamp and all of the other tech companies that are flirting with trying to impose the same restrictions on their employees.\nPolitics is not just about who\u2019s in the executive office or who\u2019s protesting what right now. It\u2019s about power and standing in society, and the idea that those things are separable from the American workplace is a view put forth conveniently by people who monopolize that power and standing. Political structures are invisible to them because they\u2019re at the top and they don\u2019t look down \u2014 sometimes unintentionally, sometimes willfully.\nIt is an incredible privilege to view politics simply as a form of self-expression and not a fundamental state of the world that permeates every aspect of life. The people who do not feel affected by politics and believe it can be compartmentalized are people whose experience of power is that they are never impeded from attaining it based on the things about themselves they cannot change, like race, or gender, or sexual orientation.\nNow politics are more front and center for a variety of reasons. Gen Z is inheriting a less stable world, and they know it. They\u2019re politically engaged naturally and know that they have to advocate for themselves. We\u2019re also facing a crisis of democracy that is driven by anti-majoritarian constituencies (who also skew white and male and not Gen Z), the results of which will affect their future in ways that prior generations haven\u2019t experienced. They are less likely to tolerate being told to put their heads down and ignore the wider implications. They can\u2019t.\nI read Rework when it came out, by the way, and I thought it was great \u2014 in part because it nicely articulated the ways in which work can be stupid and dehumanizing and needlessly so. The authors also seemed to disdain the infantilization of workers and users that\u2019s particularly endemic to the industry. (We\u2019ll ply you with toys to distract you from the fact that we\u2019re cannibalizing your every waking hour.)\nBut you\u2019d think that would make them more aware of the fact that just telling people to ignore their own concerns about equity in a workplace context is a different kind of infantilization. It\u2019s one that says, \u201cWe know what\u2019s best for you, or we wouldn\u2019t be in power ourselves\u201d\u2014a convenient lie betrayed every day by demonstrably incompetent executives who continue to get funded.\nPolitical theorist Corey Robin describes conservatism in his book, The Reactionary Mind, as \u201ca meditation on \u2014 and theoretical rendition of \u2014 the felt experience of having power, seeing it threatened, and trying to win it back.\u201d The CEOs who are so determined to give their companies the veneer of being apolitical (because they cannot achieve it in substance by definition; they can only shut down conversations about it) probably don\u2019t think of themselves as conservative or reactionary, but they are, at least in this respect. Even if they\u2019re not running corporate feudal states, which some of them wouldn\u2019t mind doing, any discussion of equity (both in the agency sense and the stock options sense) necessitates an acknowledgment of how the power structure currently works and how it might be flawed. These are inconvenient conversations for people who already have power and don\u2019t have to fight for it.\nBut they are inevitable. Founders have two options: the Coinbase and Goldman Sachs route, where you just compensate people so well that they just tacitly agree to pretend these considerations don\u2019t matter. Or you stop pretending that political conflicts at your company are about superficial partisan considerations and not standing and power, generally, and address them.\nIt\u2019s easy to distort these questions of power by reframing them as surface-level self-expression. I\u2019ve seen at least one tech executive refer to employees advocating for themselves as \u201cpolitical activism on the company dime,\u201d which really exposes the whole game. If any assertion of power or agency by an employee is de facto political activism, then there\u2019s not much that can happen with regard to determining equity that isn\u2019t \u201cpolitical.\u201d\nAnd to be fair, advocating for yourself in your own company should not be political, but it is. People who are not on the top of the power heap know that they\u2019ll be viewed that way when they protest unfair treatment or expose the ways in which the supposed meritocracy isn\u2019t one.\nTo the extent that this bleeds into actual partisan politics and activism, it\u2019s a function of ideological alignment: We have one group of people who believe that the status quo is reflective of excellence (see, nearly every founder and investor in tech who believes white male domination of the industry is a function of innate ability and not self-reinforcing screening mechanisms like \u201cculture fit\u201d) and another group who believe that the status quo is capable of producing excellence but also produces mediocrity and sometimes harm and is often determined by the whims of people whose success has little to do with their abilities.\nYou can probably guess who lines up where.\nRecurring disclosure feature: I dislike infantilizing employees, and I also dislike infantilizing readers. Nick Denton and I used to have a recurring argument about how much context a reader needed in a post and this resulted in Nick insisting that literally every proper noun be prefaced with the person\u2019s title or significance. Which is sometimes reasonable, but I nearly lost it when I had to correct \u201cGeorge W. Bush\u201d to \u201cPresident of the United States George W. Bush.\u201d So apologies if you sometimes have to google some names in My New Band Is.

You really have to read the story to understand how over-the-top this situation is, but the short version is that White has a huge fan base of women old enough to be his mom who send him gifts and money regularly and have developed a toxic parasocial relationship with him where some of them wreck their own lives if he doesn\u2019t acknowledge their gifts or takes a day off from the Internet. Some of them have been stalker-y and crossed obvious boundaries \u2014 showed up at his house, etc.\nI don\u2019t have a coherent thesis about this, but I have some thoughts, and many, many questions. I cannot relate to obsessing over any total stranger on the Internet (Hollywood celebrity, TikTok influencer, whatever) but since I am in the 40 to 55 year old mom demo, I\u2019m trying to understand what is going on here. Some hypotheticals:\nThere are people my age who still don\u2019t fully understand social relationships on the Internet because we didn\u2019t grow up with smartphones glued to our palms. I\u2019m 45, and the first time I logged onto Al Gore\u2019s Internet, I was a matriculating college freshman. I\u2019m part of the weird in between late Gen X/early Millennial \u201cCatalano\u201d generation, and well, some of us are more Internet savvy than others. (I also think of this is at the \u201cporn sex ed\u201d cutoff, where people either did or did not learn about the specifics of sex from Internet porn, and it affects their tastes and understanding of it.) I think some people in my generation just haven\u2019t internalized the fact that what people present online isn\u2019t their whole self, or in some cases, any real part of themselves. They know it academically, but it was not drilled into their heads at an early age, so it\u2019s easier for them to develop weird parasocial relationships with people they don\u2019t know.\nThere\u2019s a sadder element to this story: one of the women talks about how this kid makes her feel less invisible, and a lot of them talk about being lonely and depressed. Research says that happiness more or less declines for most people until around age 47 and then it starts going back up. This coincides for women with perimenopause which is little understood, not talked about nearly enough, and wreaks havoc on the body and emotions, and also, by the way, gives you a temporary brain fog than starts getting better once your body settles into full on menopause. So a lot of these women are experiencing a feeling that they\u2019ve lost their sexual visibility, their hormones are doing weird shit that no one can satisfactorily predict or explain, their happiness is at an all time low, their brains are foggy anyway, and ersatz baby New Kid on the Block TikTok-er is somehow boosting their moods during all of this. (Also, as women, we\u2019re not allowed to just go get a 20 something hot boyfriend and a flashy supercar we can\u2019t afford in order to work out our midlife crisis demons. We must work out all of our mortality issues quietly and unobtrusively with intense arts and crafts projects and weed gummies.)\nI wonder how much of it is pandemic-induced escapism. I personally find this kind of obsession with a 22 year old creepy, but maybe for some people it\u2019s about pretending they\u2019re not in the very difficult reality a lot of people are facing right now. Sometimes these toxic fandom dynamics emerge because they create a sense of community for people who lack it, and that sense of belonging can be driven by high stakes drama and negativity just as easily as by healthy behaviors.\nThis is more of a question: What do these women feel for this guy? Is it a maternal thing? Is it high school crush nostalgia? Do they think of themselves as fans, or sugar mommas? (If the genders were reversed and this were about a bunch of 40 and 50 something men obsessing over a pretty 22 year old women, I think we\u2019d all know what was going on there.)\nI don\u2019t have any answers, but have been thinking about what midlife crises look like for women and how they differ from the way men experience them (potentially in the service of writing something longer and more thoughtful than the \u201chey, look at this weird thing!\u201d analysis above.)

Guney, an avid pickleball player who came to the public center to play, and stayed before and after to help set up and break down the court, was reinforcing marks on the floor that had been put there by staff earlier and were fading. The Denver Parks and Recreation subsequently decided that this was damage to public property, charged him with a felony, and demanded $9,344 to refinish the floor (even though your mee maw or bubbe will tell you, you can remove marker from wood with a bit of rubbing alcohol) and demanded that he turn himself in. They tossed him in jail for a day, and are still deciding whether to prosecute. If they do, and they find him guilty, he could serve up to three years in jail.\nThis is absurd, of course, and has nothing to do with pursuit of justice. It\u2019s all the more infuriating when you consider that things like this happen every day, overwhelmingly and disproportionally to Black people, and that it is also happening in within a justice system that, so far, has failed to hold Donald Trump accountable for financial fraud as a private citizen, or orchestrating a coup as president. Within criminal justice reform circles, this is referred to as a two-tiered justice system: One system for the poor, who are subjected to incarceration before they ever go to trial because they can\u2019t meet cash bail requirements, and are often defended by overworked underresourced public defenders; and one for the wealthy and powerful, who can pay bail, sit comfortably in their homes awaiting trial, while their armies of lawyers defend them, and who often have powerful allies who can intervene on their behalf. (It needs to be said that Arslan Guney is a white retired civil engineer, and part of the reason why his story is getting national attention is that he is a white retired civil engineer.)\nThis is also happening against a backdrop of discussions about bail reform that have been covered terribly by the national news media. There is no evidence that bail reform (in the very few jurisdictions where it\u2019s actually been implemented) has increased crime. That hasn\u2019t stopped national news outlets from suggesting that it has or repeating conservative talking points to that effect, or running fact-free op-eds from former police commissioners asserting, with zero evidence, that it is. It has not stopped former police officer and mayor of New York City, Eric Adams, from parroting the same line of argument.\nThe reality of bail reform is that where it has actually been studied, in 13 jurisdictions where it has been implemented, all but one of those jurisdictions have seen decreases or statistically negligible increases in crime. This should be the headline, but it\u2019s not. It should be intuitive to people that when you put fewer people in jail before they\u2019ve been found guilty of a crime, that they are less likely to experience the spiraling effect of having been incarcerated once. (Those that have been incarcerated even just once are overwhelmingly more likely to suffer ill effects \u2014 job loss, family disruptions, etc. \u2014 and more likely to commit a crime when they leave.) And that\u2019s on top of the fact that there\u2019s nothing just about incarcerating people for misdemeanors and nonviolent felonies in the first place. It\u2019s cruel, expensive, and ineffective when you consider that almost no one skips trial when they\u2019re not detained. It criminalizes poverty, not crime.\nPeople who have no experience with our criminal justice system often cannot fathom how much damage it does to people who have done little or nothing to warrant it. You can be tossed into pretrial incarceration in New York City for jumping a subway turnstile, which \u201crobs\u201d the city of $2.75, or for stealing a sandwich or diapers , all usually \u201ccrimes\u201d of desperation.\nOr you can be tossed into Rikers Island Correctional Facility in New York City, as Kalief Browder was, because someone accuses you of stealing a backpack, and you can stay there for three years awaiting trail, simply because you can\u2019t afford bail. You can spend 17 months in solitary confinement, a practice that is literal torture and causes permanent psychological damage long after it\u2019s over, and then be found innocent, which is what happened to Browder. He died by suicide two years after his release. He was 22.\nThere are countless Kalief Browders in the system right now, many of whom have not been found guilty of a crime, and their lives are being destroyed by the detention process itself. This is regarded as normal in our criminal justice system.\nMy brothers, me, 1983 or so. Photo courtesy of the author.\nIn 2015, one of my younger brothers died at the age of 36. He was a Navy veteran who received a Section 8 discharge. As you may know, probably from watching too much TV, a Section 8 discharge is a mental illness discharge. In his early twenties, my brother began exhibiting symptoms of schizophrenia and he spent the better part of his adult life, in and out of treatment at VA centers and went through periods where he would disappear and we\u2019d eventually find him homeless, hundreds or thousands of miles away. He was also incarcerated off and on for much of the time after he was discharged.\nIn the beginning, when we were still unaccustomed to the process you go through for prison visitation (if you\u2019re a woman, no sleeveless shirts, skirts, shorts; no books for the inmates unless they\u2019re \u201cChristian books\u201d; no physical contact), I was sitting in the waiting area with my mom, and she said something to the effect of, \u201cWe don\u2019t belong here.\u201d\nAnd in one sense it was true: My brother should have been in a mental health facility, not prison. He was judged mentally competent at trial, but he also heard voices and was convinced he could tell you when you were going to die. But I think she meant it in the way that a lot of other mothers do when they find the children they worked so hard to raise well on the receiving end of the carceral system: My child is not one of \u201cthose\u201d people. He is not a bad person; why are we here?\nPrisons are full of people who don\u2019t belong there \u2014 because they\u2019re mentally ill, because they\u2019re innocent, because incarceration is a wildly disproportionate punishment for the crime they\u2019ve committed. And visitation rooms are full of good parents who did everything right in addition to parents who made mistakes. There is no one who inherently belongs in prison.\nBut the carceral state makes some people , overwhelmingly white middle class people, feel safe. It makes people in San Francisco, who hate Chesa Boudin and think the solution to homelessness is to throw homeless people in prison, feel safe. It makes New Yorkers who willfully misunderstand crime stats get touchy about shutting down Rikers, a dangerously mismanaged prison that even insiders think is not rehab-able. There are a lot of people in this country who are very invested in the idea that imprisoning people who make them feel uncomfortable is just.\nAnd very often it produces its own injustice. Incarceration, even once, for a short period of time, can destroy lives, communities, and families, permanently. If you want to turn someone into a criminal, toss them into jail for a month and see what happens when they get out; what they resort to when they can\u2019t get a job, have been isolated from their families and communities, have experienced physical and psychological trauma. This happens all the time, to people who did nothing wrong, or minor things, like stealing diapers, often out of desperation. How many people are sitting in prison for marijuana possession while the world\u2019s richest man smokes up on Joe Rogan\u2019s podcast with no consequences?\nIn 2017, my business partner Peter (who is a pollster) and I started working with New York State Assemblyman Dan Quart, in part because Dan was working on criminal justice reform issues. Dan is a lawyer who also defends indigent clients, part-time, in criminal cases and is directly aware of how broken the system is. As a result, he was and still is an advocate for bail reform, and other criminal justice reform measures that Peter and I felt strongly about, including the decriminalization of sex work, and reforming sentencing laws. One of his victories during the time we worked with him was a repeal of New York state\u2019s gravity knives ban, which had been used to arrest close to 60,000 New Yorkers, for possessing any kind of knife that can be flicked open with one hand. This includes any number of utility knives used in construction, and for outdoor activities. You can buy a gravity knife at any REI, but until this statute was repealed (for the third time, after two vetoes by former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo), it was illegal to own one in your home. The people who were arrested most frequently for owning a gravity knife were not hobbyist mountain climbers, though; they were Black and Brown people who worked in construction.\nWe also knew Dan had ambitions of running for Manhattan DA, eventually. Progressive prosecutors are instrumental to criminal justice reform, so that was appealing, too, particularly since he would be running against Cyrus Vance, the sitting Manhattan DA, who had continued to prosecute low level crimes while letting rich and powerful people off the hook. In fact, the people Vance had declined to prosecute were a murderer\u2019s row, so to speak, of famous names. He declined to prosecute Donald Jr. and Ivanka Trump, over the objections of his own prosecutors, after a Trump lawyer donated $50,000 to his reelection campaign. He let Harvey Weinstein off the hook, initially, until public pressure and mounting evidence forced him to do otherwise. His office argued for the lightest possible consequences for Jeffrey Epstein. He let Dominque Strauss-Kahn walk. This is on top of the many sex crimes he declined to prosecute because, like nearly all sexual assault and rape cases, they were not slam dunk wins.\nThere are probably some personal qualities about Vance that led him to these decisions, but there\u2019s also a structural incentive. DAs are obsessed with win ratios. It\u2019s much harder to win a case against a defendant who has an army of high paid lawyers, and in cases where there are no eyewitnesses, that is, nearly every rape case.\nBut the district attorney\u2019s mandate is not to win cases for the sake of wins; it is to pursue justice. The DA can\u2019t prosecute every case, but it has an obligation to prosecute cases that present reasonable evidence, regardless of whether those cases are going to have obviously successful outcomes.\nBy the time Dan announced that he was officially running for DA a couple of years later, we were no longer working together, except in a volunteer capacity. (Peter and I co-hosted a couple of fundraisers for Dan, and we still talked regularly.) Several months after Dan announced, Alvin Bragg entered the race. Bragg had similar values, was a progressive, was very vocal about criminal justice reform and ending the two-tiered justice system.\nVance, perhaps in an effort to salvage his own legacy, had not punted on the Trumps a second time, and was pursuing a criminal case against Donald Trump. He had hired, arguably, the best white collar fraud prosecutors in the country \u2014 Mark Pomerantz, who came out of retirement to work on the case because he thought it was important \u2014 and brought in specialists who were accustomed to prosecuting organized crime. Bragg, who was familiar with the contours of the case, promised to continue Vance\u2019s work.\nI am a Brooklyn resident and could not vote for the Manhattan DA, but when Dan lost the primary, I was relieved that Bragg had won it. His priorities were very close to Dan\u2019s and, except for my loyalty to Dan, he would have been my second choice. A Harlem native and Harvard Law grad, Bragg is accomplished, smart, and experienced. As deputy attorney general, he ran the criminal justice division and oversaw lawsuits against Trump and Weinstein.\nHe is also the first Black DA in Manhattan\u2019s history, the importance of which cannot be understated. Black people are disproportionately affected by the criminal justice system, which is structurally racist.** Representation matters, and Bragg had been stopped at gunpoint three times by the NYPD. No one else who was running had that experience. No one else had been on the receiving end of a system that is deeply and profoundly broken.\nSo while I was disappointed for Dan, I was excited about Bragg, and hopeful. But Bragg had a bumpy start. Because he was serious about reform, he was criticized (largely by the right, it must be said) as being soft on crime, when he began declining to seek prison time for things like illegal gun possession, where the guns are not used in any sort of crime. This happened concurrently with a nationwide spike in crime, partly a result of the pandemic, but which has been nonetheless portrayed as a function of progressive politics and bail reform, despite the fact that the biggest crime increases nationwide are in cities that have enacted no bail reform at all. (In terms of violent crimes, shootings are up across the board, which you\u2019d think would point to a need for gun control, and not locking up more poor people before they\u2019ve been found guilty of anything, but no.)\nManhattan DA, Alvin Bragg\nNone of this is Bragg\u2019s fault, but it seems to have rattled him. He has already walked back some of those policies, and it\u2019s only been three months.\nWhich brings us to the biggest walk-back of all: Bragg\u2019s office is effectively declining to prosecute Donald Trump for criminal financial fraud. His two top white collar prosecutors have resigned as a result, and his office has reportedly begun sending files back to Trump Org, which is a process that happens in the course of wrapping up a case. By all indications, Bragg has decided not to pursue a case against Trump.\nBragg\u2019s office has not been forthcoming about why this is happening, or even whether it\u2019s happening. Pomerantz\u2019s resignation letter, which was recently published in the New York Times, indicates that Bragg abruptly stopped pursuing the case, despite the fact that Vance had already directed prosecutors to seek indictment and believed there was more than enough evidence to pursue it. Pomerantz, for his part, was unequivocal about the quality of evidence: \u201cThe team that has been investigating Mr. Trump harbors no doubt about whether he committed crimes \u2014 he did.\u201d\n\u201cI believe that your decision not to prosecute Donald Trump now, and on the existing record, is misguided and completely contrary to the public interest,\u201d he continued, in his resignation letter, \u201cI therefore cannot continue in my current position.\u201d\nThis raises many questions. Defenders of Bragg, none of whom are party to the evidence Pomerantz is talking about, have suggested that Bragg\u2019s decision not to pursue the case is a function of not having enough in terms of witness testimony. Michael Cohen, Trump\u2019s former personal lawyer, has a history of lying. The CFO of Trump Org is not cooperating as far as we know (though his son\u2019s ex-wife is).\nBut these are not sufficient explanations. First, Vance, and the specialist prosecutors he hired, all thought otherwise. What does Bragg know that they didn\u2019t? Bragg has experience prosecuting white collar fraud, and is by no means inexpert on the topic, but his depth of expertise with regard to this kind of financial fraud is not as deep as Pomerantz\u2019s nor his colleague Carey Dunne, who also resigned. They are not junior prosecutors; they are the elite special forces of white collar fraud prosecution.\nThe potential unreliability of Cohen\u2019s verbal testimony is also not sufficient, because even unreliable witnesses can produce reliable documents and other types of evidence. (This is sometimes true in journalism of sources who lie. Even liars have incentives to tell the truth sometimes.)\nWhat\u2019s more, the prosecutors and Vance believed not only that the case was solid enough to proceed, but if Pomerantz\u2019s letter is any indication, that it was winnable. \u201cNo doubt about whether he committed crimes\u201d is not ambiguous, and it\u2019s certainly not hard to believe, given Trump\u2019s history of financial shenanigans which have been heavily documented in the press for decades.\nOne of the best early pieces about Trump\u2019s failed casino operations and the shell games he played to finance them was written by John Connolly for SPY magazine in 1991. Reading its exhaustive account of how Trump misrepresented his financial condition to lenders, the media, and virtually anyone he interacted with, you can only marvel that Trump wasn\u2019t indicted long before he ran for president. Notably, the piece begins with an anonymous quote from a person described as a \u201cmobster friend of Trump\u2019s\u201d: \u201cHe\u2019d lie to you about what time of day it was, just for the practice.\u201d\nI do not believe that Trump has reformed himself since the 1990s, and given that he had no problem attempting to break the law as president \u2014 repeatedly, openly, and not in any sophisticated way \u2014 I would imagine that there is no shortage of evidence that he committed fraud in the instances that the DA\u2019s office was examining. He does not exactly have a penchant for crossing his Ts and dotting his Is, and cannot keep his lies straight because he lies so compulsively. So I find it hard to believe that for the specific period the DA\u2019s office was investigating that Trump did nothing wrong, and I find it hard to believe that there\u2019s not enough evidence that he did to proceed with a case. It would run counter to everything we know about Trump.\nHere, I want to go back to a systemic problem I mentioned earlier about DAs and win ratios. Another defense I\u2019ve seen of Bragg\u2019s decision not to pursue the case is that if he can\u2019t win it definitively, if it isn\u2019t a slam dunk case, that he should not pursue it because it would \u201cembolden Donald Trump.\u201d\nThis is a corrupt argument, on two fronts. First, it presumes that justice should only be pursued in cases where wins are guaranteed, which would preclude pursuit of justice in nearly any case of real importance. Because DAs are elected officials, they have an incentive to only pursue cases that are obvious wins, sometimes at the overt expense of justice. They can campaign on a high win ratio, which voters conflate with capability and competence. In practice, this means that there are types of cases that do not get prosecuted when they should be prosecuted. (Sexual assault and rape cases in particular. When there are only two parties involved and no eyewitnesses, those cases are harder to win.) And winning should not be the paramount consideration; it should be pursuit of justice. DAs have to use discretion in deciding what to pursue because they can\u2019t pursue everything, but the \u201cwinnability\u201d of a case should not the bar for proceeding; the preponderance of evidence should be. That is how the system works in theory; and how most Americans think it works.\nSecondly, how a loss might affect Trump is utterly irrelevant. Our judiciary system should be free of political considerations. (I also find the idea that he would be more emboldened by a lost prosecution than a failure to prosecute in the first place backwards and dumb. He is already emboldened because he has faced no real consequences for anything he\u2019s done.) A decision to decline prosecution because of how it might play out in the next election cycle is a corrupt decision. I do not believe that this is what Bragg is doing, but all of the galaxy-brain, armchair strategists on Twitter who think this should be a consideration need to revisit their basic civics classes so they can better understand why we have three separate branches of government and what checks and balances mean.\nThe Trump case is particularly important because it\u2019s a big public test of who is and isn\u2019t above the law. If you believe we shouldn\u2019t have a two-tiered justice system, it is deeply important that the (formerly) most powerful man in government be held accountable the same way people without power and money are. This is particularly true in a system where people without power and money are often victimized by a carceral state that punishes them before they are ever found guilty of a crime.\nThe Bronx DA\u2019s office indicted Kalief Browder because he had allegedly stolen a backpack. Trump has left a trail of incriminating activity and documentation so messy his lawyers and accounting firms are now disavowing that they had any idea what was in them, and the DA is arguing, against the advice of his expert prosecutors, that there\u2019s not enough to proceed. In what alternate universe are these just outcomes?\nOf course, the law is not and has never been, value neutral.*** And politics corrupt the judiciary on a regular basis, but that\u2019s not an argument for knowingly allowing it.\nMore importantly, political interest should not be conflated with public interest, and in the case of Trump, it is absolutely in the public interest to prosecute Trump if there is reasonable evidence that he committed a crime. Rule of law only matters inasmuch as it is enforced.\nThe DA\u2019s office was investigating Trump for fraud he potentially committed in the private sector, and not in his capacity as president, which is, perversely, a more thorny problem where accountability is harder to achieve. The impeachment process is inherently political, and the only real accountability mechanism that could result in removal of a sitting president. Trump did get impeached twice, though not convicted and removed, but there was a hesitancy to do it, especially the first time. I wrote about the dangers of failure to impeach when it looked like Democrats were going to great lengths to avoid it, for political reasons:\nHere\u2019s the real risk, both morally and politically: If Pelosi treats Trump as an aberration and continues to be passive in the hopes that we can all power through until next November, there\u2019s no accountability mechanism built into our system of democracy that has any real credibility. There\u2019s no crime so severe that Trump can\u2019t get away with it \u2014 not intentionally neglecting Brown children until they die in cages, not being openly racist, not raping women, not helping hostile foreign powers and covering up for dictatorial regimes that torture American journalists to death, not putting American lives at risk in imperialistic and prosecutorial wars. That\u2019s especially true for the offense that should be the most straightforward impeachment charge in this case \u2014 obstructing justice when our system of government works by design to prevent the president from abusing his power for personal gain. If nothing Trump does matters during this administration, nothing our system of democracy has in place to prevent descent into autocracy and tyranny matters, either\u2026\nThe long-run cost here is that leadership that does nothing turns us all into nihilists, whether we like it or not\u2026 In this scheme of things, norms and laws are perfunctory theater, at best. Anyone who\u2019s savvy enough and has enough resources can do exactly what Trump has done, and do it with impunity, and in a more damaging way, because there\u2019s now a road map for doing it. And under such conditions, the only way to survive in a system governed entirely by nihilism is to become a nihilist yourself \u2014 even for self-styled members of a resistance.\nI think the same applies here, both because he is a former president, and because as a private citizen, too many people get away with exactly the kind of white collar fraud it appears that Trump has committed. (I\u2019m quite sure there are many commercial real estate executives in Manhattan who are relieved that Bragg is dropping the case.)\nI don\u2019t know Bragg personally and have no particular unique insight to his personal motives here. Some people who are frustrated at his decision have suggested that maybe he has been threatened by Trump aligned interests. While I certainly wouldn\u2019t put it past Trump (he\u2019s done plenty of monstrous things in public; there\u2019s no reason to believe he doesn\u2019t do them in private), I doubt that\u2019s what\u2019s happening. That said, I do believe that Bragg is under more scrutiny than he was prepared for, and am quite sure he\u2019s gotten a number of threats from right wingers generally, because I get them for far less. But as a prosecutor, he should be used to threats from criminal interests and people who just oppose what he\u2019s doing.\nI think the more likely explanation is that he\u2019s so wrapped up in the bubble of New York City politics, and the DA\u2019s role historically, that he views this case as ordinary, and highly risky \u2014 not because there are flaws with the case, but because it is so high profile, and because a win is not guaranteed. (To repeat myself: This is almost always the case.) He believes that a loss would be a devastating mark on his career, and since it would be the most high profile case he\u2019s prosecuted, it would eclipse anything good that he wants to do.\nI sincerely hope that\u2019s not the case, because if it is, that rationale is cowardly, selfish, and, I agree with Pomerantz, runs counter to public interest. There is more at stake here than Bragg\u2019s career, and he ran for office on promises to hold Trump, and people like Trump, accountable. He was familiar with much of the evidence of the case then, and gave no indication that he thought it was insufficient for an indictment. In fact, he expressed confidence that the opposite was true. If he declines to prosecute, and that appears to be what he is doing, he is breaking those promises, even though he knew what he was signing up for when he ran for office. If his start out of the gate has been shakier than anticipated, it\u2019s unfortunate, but should have no bearing on his decision making here.\nAt the very least, he owes the public an explanation. If there is some compelling reason why he believes his predecessor and his expert prosecutors are not only wrong, but aggressively overconfident in their assessment, he should be able to convey that to everyone who is watching Trump walk away from potential criminal charges, yet again. I want to give Bragg the benefit of the doubt, but am finding it very hard to imagine any scenario where his decision makes sense.\nBack to my younger brother. It\u2019s reasonable if you\u2019re wondering what he did that led to his incarceration, especially if you have no personal experience with the criminal justice system. I will tell you, even though I don\u2019t like to talk about it. No one in my family does. But it\u2019s a material part of what happened subsequently.\nMy brother Philip, 1994. Photo courtesy of the author.\nOne day, at the nadir of his mental illness and addiction problems, he got up one morning and drove to various stores in the county where he lived, and, there\u2019s no other way to put this, grabbed multiple women (three, I think) by the ass. He laughed when he did it. To put it bluntly, he sexually assaulted them. We don\u2019t know why. He didn\u2019t know why, really. He barely remembered it later.\nI don\u2019t blame these women one bit for pressing charges. I would have, too.\nThe end result, however, was that after they reported it, the local police went looking for my brother, which was not unexpected by itself. My parents lived in a part of Alabama that is fairly rural and very conservative and not much exciting happens to the local police so this very quickly turned into, as it was cast in local news, a \u201cmanhunt for a sexual predator.\u201d The police raided his apartment expecting to find evidence of all sorts of sexual deviance and found nothing. Philip didn\u2019t even own a computer. Nonetheless, he was marched into court, on the local NBC affiliate, in an orange jumpsuit \u2014 the dangerous predator had been caught. My parents found out about it from a family friend, just before they watched it happen on the local news.\nThe upshot of this is that his first stint in prison was for sexual assault, and his subsequent stints were probation violations: public drunkenness, a DUI, and so on. When he died, he had no job and was forbidden from living or working within a certain distance of any school. This is because our legal system conflates all sex crimes with pedophilia, and permanently puts people into sex crimes registries that prevent them having anything resembling a normal life, ever again, no matter how much time they serve. Something, incidentally, we don\u2019t do to people who are accused and found guilty of murder.\nAll of this devastated my parents and contributed heavily to the end of their marriage. There were people they considered friends who disappeared, as if what had happened to them was contagious.\nWhen people are incarcerated, it\u2019s not just the incarcerated who suffer. Their families are punished as well, even if that\u2019s not the intended effect. The carceral system orphans children all the time, and drives people into poverty. It victimizes innocent people in this way. (This is part of the reason why the knock-on effects of even a short pretrial detention are so insidious; among other things, many people are at risk of losing jobs if they unexpectedly miss even a day of work.)\nMy family was better equipped to handle it than many, at least materially, but my family is not wealthy. My dad is a retired local lineman, which means he has a decent pension thanks to the union, but is by no means well-off. If my family was rich, and could have afforded an army of expensive private lawyers, there\u2019s a possibility Philip would have never gone to jail at all; instead he\u2019d be in a mental health facility full of helpful, competent professionals. Before his conviction, he had been getting counseling services from the severely and perpetually underfunded VA, and it wasn\u2019t enough. In jail, he had no meaningful mental health services at all.\nI\u2019m also aware if Philip had not been white, everything he experienced would have been 10 times worse, in a variety of ways. There are countless people in prison right now who are being treated worse for far less.\nOn Monday, a federal judge ruled that Donald Trump likely committed multiple felonies, including obstructing a Congressional investigation and \u201cconspiring to defraud the United States\u201d in connection with the January 6 insurrection and his apparent attempt to overturn the 2020 election. The January 6 committee can choose to refer him for criminal prosecution to the Department of Justice, and may choose to do so.\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James is pursuing Trump on a civil basis, and there are numerous other lawsuits outstanding. So Bragg is not the only person who can hold Trump accountable, but so far, Trump has eluded anything remotely resembling accountability for the entirety of his career, and despite mountains of evidence. By contrast, Browder was accused of stealing a backpack by one person, using notoriously unreliable eyewitness identification, two weeks after the incident happened.\nBut there\u2019s a parallel that particularly grates for me. Trump has been credibly accused of sexually assaulting 19 women, and I\u2019m quite sure that\u2019s not including the number of asses he\u2019s probably grabbed over the course of many parties and episodes out with Jeffrey Epstein. There\u2019s no reason to believe that a guy who bragged about \u201cgrabbing \u2019em by the pussy\u201d would for some reason restrain himself on the ass-grabbing front. By the standards to which my mentally ill brother was held, Trump should probably be incarcerated for 50 lifetimes for sexual assault alone. But he is not my brother; he has money and power, and that renders him immune to consequences. He also, as far as we know, has no issues with mental illness, and was perfectly cognizant of his actions. He did these things with no regard for the people he harmed.\nMy brother died in February of 2015, when I was five months pregnant with my son. He lived in a trailer not too far from my dad, in central Alabama, and my parents hadn\u2019t heard from him in a couple of days. My dad went to check on him and found his truck parked in the driveway but the front door was locked.\nWhen my dad called to tell me, I was coming out of a dermatologist appointment. A lifelong situational hypochondriac, I was convinced that a mole I had was cancerous, in part, because I was pregnant and could not stop catastrophizing about things that could go wrong. I had just been told that the mole was fine. I wasn\u2019t going to die pregnant or leave an infant stranded without a mother, and I was feeling relieved, if not elated.\nDad sounded strange when I answered the phone, and he explained that he had broken into the trailer and found Philip on the floor, where he had collapsed. He began crying, and I did, too. Neither of us said anything for a minute. It was mutually understood that what had likely happened was probably related to his addiction problems. But my parents didn\u2019t really want to know. It didn\u2019t matter, at that point. The mental illness, his incarceration, his addiction \u2014 they were all related.\nIt was very important to my parents that Philip be given a military burial because they were proud of his service. My dad was also a veteran and so were other people in my family. It\u2019s a refrain among people in the criminal justice community that people are always more than the worst thing they\u2019ve ever done. For my parents, this was a way of remembering an aspect of my brother\u2019s life that highlighted his better self and reminded them of the child and young adult they knew before his mental health issues proceeded to dismantle him.\nIn high school, he had been charismatic, passionate about people and things he loved, beloved by his friends and family. He was popular, because he was funny and charming, a natural leader, and a talented athlete who later breezed through boot camp. I was adopted and Philip wasn\u2019t, but we were only 20 months apart and when we were toddlers, people sometimes thought we were twins. When we were older, he was cool and I was not, and I was happy to hang out quietly in the halo of whatever he had that made everyone love him, with my books and nerd accoutrements. We bickered a lot as kids but became closer as we got older, confided in each other about our parents and our futures. And then I went off to college.\nOne night, when I was a sophomore, in school in North Carolina, he called me at four in the morning to ask me what I thought of God, which is the kind of thing you might do at that age after a party and one too many drinks, but he was stone cold sober. He rambled for a while about things that made no sense, and I think that was the first time I realized something was off.\nLater, he was withdrawn, sullen, missed social cues, and developed a sense that everyone, including sometimes his own family, were people who were out to get him. He alternately told my parents he loved them and threatened them for fantastical imagined transgressions. He also had good days, particularly in the last couple of years of his life, when he was back home, where he was obviously not his former self, but seemed content, happy even. Sometimes his medication worked well enough that he had some sense of normalcy. When he found out I was pregnant, he was excited about his new nephew. He wanted to teach him to play the guitar.\nFor our sake and his, we choose to remember those days and the before; the times he was generous, inspiring, went out of his way to make people laugh, when he was more fully and wholly himself.\nPhoto courtesy of the author\nPhilip is my six-year-old son\u2019s middle name. He was born four months after Philip died. When he is old enough to understand what happened, I will tell him that those are the qualities my brother had that I value and remember. When he is old enough to understand what justice means in this country, that conversation will be more complicated. If I ever have to go into detail, I will have to explain why his mentally ill uncle spent much of his adult life in and out of prison for a fraction of what a former president repeatedly got away with, and whose transgressions were dismissed as locker room behavior. He may one day have questions about why his uncle was ostracized by society, often by people who support the former president, and claim to be followers of Christianity, a religion that in theory preaches mercy and forgiveness, and also advocates for real justice \u2014 the same people, who when confronted with the poor and vulnerable, are more likely to incarcerate them than help them.\nIncarceration serves another function for a lot of these people: It renders real material problems and the people who have them invisible. Out of sight, out of mind.\nHere in the present, at the rate we\u2019re going, Trump will never be held accountable for anything, no matter how monstrous. We have a carceral system that does not rehabilitate anyone, definitely leads to more crime and incarceration, and is completely avoidable if you have enough power and money, regardless of the crimes you commit, no matter how many, or how severe.\nWhen Trump said he could shoot somebody in the middle of Fifth Avenue, he was probably correct. (Meanwhile, other people get tossed into jail for jaywalking.)\nThere are people who can change this, and Bragg is not the only one, by any stretch. He is just the most recent person to make a conscious decision not to. I hope my analysis is wrong. I hope he has a good reason that I don\u2019t understand or can\u2019t fathom. I find it hard to believe that the best white collar prosecutors in the country can\u2019t build a case against someone as sloppy and openly corrupt as Trump, especially given Pomerantz\u2019s statements that they did exactly that.\nAnd if Bragg doesn\u2019t have a good reason, I hope he changes his mind, which I assume there is still time to do.\nIn the meantime, I find it hard not to be angry and upset. I expect and want more from my country. I want a justice system that actually works and doesn\u2019t ruin people\u2019s lives for the sake of safety theater while enabling people like Trump who view right and wrong as a matter of letter of the law legality and morality as a disposable construct designed only to constrain the behavior of people who lack means. I don\u2019t want a system that is inhumanely punitive to people whose violations of laws and norms come from a place of economic desperation or mental illness, and not punitive at all to people who are willfully malicious because they\u2019re corrupt and rich and they know they can get away with it and harm others with impunity. In some sense, this anger is a gift. I worry that if I wake up one day without it, it won\u2019t be gone because everything is better; it\u2019ll be gone because I\u2019ve resigned myself to the sorry state we find ourselves in now.\nAnd I don\u2019t want that to happen. I don\u2019t ever want to be okay with it. I want more for all of us.\n** If for whatever reason, you do not believe this, I suggest you volunteer for a criminal justice reform organization or legal aid for a month, and get back to me. I will even suggest specific organizations for you.\n*** This is the primary argument of critical race theory. It is so self-evident, it shouldn\u2019t be controversial, which is why right wingers have to completely redefine it as any discussion of race that makes white people uncomfortable in order to impugn it. CRT makes eminently reasonable arguments, so conservatives have to distort them entirely to arrive at a conclusion that CRT is bad, and they rely on the public\u2019s ignorance of what CRT actually is to do this.

It\u2019s okay.\nA couple of weeks ago, I wrote a column about why journalists need to pay attention to their \u201cbrands,\u201d and this is the promised service-y follow up column about what you need to do at minimum if you are not already a rich and famous person who either does not need to worry about these things because job security is not an issue for you or because anyone who would hire or work with you already knows who you are. Which is not me, and not most of you.\nSo first, I just want to reiterate a point from the prior column: building your brand is not you on the Internet, digitally yelling ME ME ME LOOK AT ME. It is simply putting your work, and by extension yourself, in places where people who can make your work successful are. And people in this context in include, colleagues, potential employers, and the people who are your audience \u2014 readers, viewers, listeners. All of the things on this list are inexpensive or free to do and most them require little or no time investment. So here we go:\nNUMBER ONE: Have a website, ideally with your name as the URL, that explains who you are and what you do. If possible, put some of your work on that website. This might sound like a very DUH recommendation, but I do a lot of hiring and I always Google promising candidates and you\u2019d be surprised at how often nothing comes up in the way of a centralized place for this information. I have a site here, and it needs a redesign, and I need to update it, and I haven\u2019t had short blonde hair since before the pandemic, but it gets the job done. It\u2019s the first search result for \u201cElizabeth Spiers.\u201d\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t know how to build a website!\u201d some of you might be thinking. I have good news for you: you don\u2019t have to know shit about web development to do this. Squarespace, Wix, and a number of other services exists to allow people who don\u2019t know how to build websites do it. I use Squarespace and it\u2019s $14 a month, which I think is pretty good for the amount of functionality you can build into the site and about what you\u2019d pay if you designed it yourself and just paid for hosting.\nAt bare minimum, your website should include:\nYour bio\nWhat you do now\nSome examples of what you do now\nIf you want the website to do more for you, you should also include:\nSome indication of what you\u2019d like to be doing or aspire to do\nInformation about where to find you on other platforms (Twitter, LinkedIn, whatever)\nYour resume/CV, either as a page or downloadable link\nA full archive of your work\nI\u2019m stealing this from my NYU boss, Jay Rosen: a \u201cwhere I\u2019m coming from statement\u201d that explains how who you are and your background informs your work. I have not yet done this, but I should.\nIt\u2019s important to have a dedicated website (as opposed to just a LinkedIn profile) tied to your name because when people search for you, you want to be able to control what they see first. If you don\u2019t have something like this, you are at the mercy of the algos and whatever pops up about you on social platforms.\nNUMBER TWO: Be where your colleagues are, digitally\nThere\u2019s a rolling meta-discourse about what we do as journalists and how we do it, and it\u2019s important for you to know what that conversation is, and ideally, to participate in it. For better or worse, that means being on social media to some extent. You want to make sure, in particular, that you are present where your colleagues (and potential employers) are for your particular medium. If you\u2019re a writer, your people are probably on Twitter. If you\u2019re a photographer or videographer, maybe Insta, TikTok. Whatever.\nThe point is that you want to be present. Being where your colleagues are also gives you an opportunity to informally put your work in front of them, by linking to it or publishing it. You are signaling to people that this is what you do, and this is what your work looks like.\nThis does not mean you have to be omnipresent on these platforms, all the time. I am a very online type by virtue of the kind of work I do, but you don\u2019t have to be. You just need to participate where appropriate. That said, as a writer, I personally find Twitter useful for working through arguments for potential columns, asking questions, learning from subject area experts and so on. It has real professional utility for me. (It also sometimes cannibalizes my time and attention, so I\u2019ve put some boundaries around my own Twitter usage so that it\u2019s not a bottomless energy and time suck. I recommend doing this, too. Turn off notifications while you\u2019re at it.)\nAnd if you\u2019re just setting up accounts, do not choose @YourNameAtYourNewsOrg. If you change news orgs, and you need to be prepared for the fact that this could happen whether you want it to or not, you don\u2019t want to have to start from scratch or awkwardly proceed with an account that appears to be tied to your former employer.\nNUMBER THREE: Say yes to everything that will get your work in front of people.\nIf someone offers you an interview or a podcast appearance or a tv spot, say yes. Writers particularly chafe at this advice because it means operating in a medium that does not consist of words on the page, and I get it. But I also do cable TV appearances occasionally. It\u2019s not my preferred medium, and I am not particularly good on TV \u2014 I think studio lights temporarily knock 20 points off of my IQ \u2014 but I do it anyway. Why? It\u2019s marketing for the columns I write. (Also, my parents are not really people who read, but they do watch TV and even at 45, I still enjoy impressing my parents.)\nIt\u2019s worth doing this because new mediums get you in front of new audiences. And a professional brand is something that typically gets built incrementally, not with one blockbuster story, but with consistent work that people consistently see. And part of being seen means looking for places to put yourself and your work and getting in front of people.\nEven if you work for news and media outlets that have marketing support, no one is invested in people seeing your work like you are.\nMy first job in media was starting Gawker with Nick Denton in 2002, and Gawker was very New York City-centric at the time. It mostly covered NYC specific trends and New York media, so journalists were a big part of the early audience. I remember being surprised the first time a journalist from The New York Times sent me a link to their own work, in the hopes that I\u2019d pick it up and link to it. But I very quickly learned why it was smart. If I linked to the piece, it didn\u2019t particularly expand the scope of how many people saw it overall, but it absolutely meant that a lot of other journalists were going to see it, including people with hiring and commissioning power.\nThe exceptions to the \u201csay yes to everything\u201d rule are instances where you should be paid for your expertise. (Say yes, but make them pay you.)\nNUMBER FOUR: Get over the idea that it\u2019s crass to market your work and do it every time. If you don\u2019t like the idea of promoting your own work and your professional expertise that belongs only to you, ask yourself why. Here\u2019s some pushback I\u2019ve gotten from people I\u2019ve taught and hired:\n\u201cMy work speaks for itself.\u201d It absolutely does not. If you think it does, it\u2019s because you\u2019re taking for granted the other people who are promoting it, either at your institution (thank you audience people, comms, editors who put that headline on your piece, SEO managers who optimized it), or among your peer network. You owe it to those people to do your part as well.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to come off as braggy.\u201d If you\u2019re coming off as braggy, you\u2019re doing it wrong. But I rarely ever see this actually happen. People who are good at promoting themselves remind people of their work, expertise and interests, consistently, and frequently, but also seamlessly. I think of historian Twitter, which I enjoy and find eminently useful, as a model for this. The historians I follow there tie history to current events, point to relevant things they\u2019ve written, and also to other experts and sources. I am not a historian but am now familiar with a cluster of subject area experts because I heavily associate them with their work as a result.\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have to do this. I went into journalism to report, not tweet.\u201d Yeah, and in the last century, reporters for newspapers thought \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have to write\u201d because other people did that. Reporting and writing were separate jobs. But the profession changes, and so do its requirements. You and I operate in a far more competitive and complex media environment that our forebears did. Technological changes mean we have to do both more and less. You can either accept that, and use it to your advantage, or you can be the person sitting on your horse who looks at the car and says, \u201cfuck, you want me to learn how to drive? I went into the transportation business to deliver myself from place to place via horse and now you\u2019re telling me I have to deliver myself from place to place by car and figure out all these switches and gears do?\u201d And look, I appreciate your frustration. No one likes it when their chosen profession invariably demands that they do some things they don\u2019t particularly enjoy or that they find tedious. But I\u2019ve also worked in technology, politics, and finance, and in my experience that particular hazard occurs in every job in every industry. (You should also ask yourself, with as much self-awareness as you can muster, whether your real objection is that you think doing this sort of thing is beneath you. If you do, you need to work on whatever insecurity makes you think you\u2019ll be rejected by your peers if you\u2019re seen to be doing things that appear to be beneath you. What is it that you think will happen, and why? And is avoiding that preferable to your work being seen less?)\nBy \u201cdo it every time\u201d I mean: post your work to the relevant social platforms. Bring it up when relevant conversations come up. If you\u2019re feeling ambitious, send it to people who might find it useful or relevant. Take credit for it.\nThose are the minimum requirements to shore up your brand, which is really just your professional reputation in all of its public incarnations, which yes, do include you the person, as you appear and interact with the rest of the community. I\u2019ll probably write another one of these for the more ambitious among you with suggestions about how to go a step further, with some things I don\u2019t do myself, but I know would absolutely help me professionally if I did.**\n**this is mostly a time and resources issue. Like, I should update my personal site right now, and fix the bug that makes it look like shit on mobile, but right now I am busy writing a thing about branding for journalists that will invariably provoke some \ud83e\udd2e responses from people who can\u2019t get past the headline, but I careth not.

This is how it feels to watch from afar as your homeland is attacked.\nSasha Dobrenko \u2014 can it get any more soviet than this\nI was born in Odessa, Ukraine.\nLast week, Odessa was invaded by Russian forces. As was the rest of Ukraine. By the time of my publishing this, hundreds of Ukrainians have died. If I was still in Ukraine, I could be dead.\nFar more likely though, I would be alive, fearing for my life and that of my family. President Zelinsky has commanded all men age 18 to 60 to stay and fight. So I would be prepping to fight, or already on the battlefield. So would my dad. And all my friends.\nBut I am not there. I am here, safe in Los Angeles, watching as Putin\u2019s forces invade the soil on which I was born. Luckily, we don\u2019t have any family left in Ukraine \u2014 everyone has left for either America or Israel. Such is not the case, obviously, for the 44 million people who call Ukraine home today.\nAccording to my dad, Odessa is the humor capital of the world. This fact hasn\u2019t been corroborated by any sources besides the super unbiased odessareview.com. This proclamation, in and of itself, is a very good joke. A great bit, to call yourselves the humor capital of the world. The comedy of these people, of my people, runs deep. I wonder what jokes one can make right now to deal with the pain, the fear, the uncertainty that you will see tomorrow. If anyone can do it, it\u2019s the people of Odessa.\nIts day seven of the invasion. I wake up in the middle of the night to check Twitter and see what\u2019s happening on the ground. The people of Ukraine are terrified yet resolute. They will not go quietly into the good night.\nThe world watches on, cynical and enraged. Everything is bad, all governments corrupt. Will the sanctions be enough? I have no idea.\nI feel angry. Protective of my country. Of my home. I want to scream that people don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on, that they all need to just shut up \u2014 that this is MY HOME they\u2019re talking about.\nBut is it? What do I know about Ukraine? We left as Jewish refugees when I was seven years old. I spent the next 27 years trying to become as American as I could, inhaling pizza bagels and dino nuggets and toaster strudels by the thousands, and yet the Ukrainian Russian Jew in me never left. You can\u2019t just Twinkie and 4 cans of Coca-Cola or Pepsi (depending on which was on sale) your way into being an American.\nMy mind spins through doomsday scenarios \u2014 is this the end of America as a superpower? Will Russia and China unite and try to take down the west? How many Ukrainians will die? How many Russians will die? I don\u2019t know.\nBut I do know that I am safe in my home in Los Angeles, coffee in hand, as our baby sleeps, peaceful in his room. Well actually he\u2019s crying now. He\u2019s awake. Ready to greet the day and say hello to the six framed photos of baby animals in his room.\nGood morning Peter the rabbit.\nGood morning Frankie the fox.\nGood morning Porky the porcupine.\nGood morning Derek the deer.\nGood morning Brownie the bear.\nGood morning Rocky the raccoon.\nWhat a privilege it is to greet the baby animals without fear that the kindergarten next to your house will be bombed.\nI have learned my wife and I call them by different names. I will be taking her to court to get this settled.\nI think about how our baby has no idea what\u2019s going on. And how, really, none of us do. We are not there. We are spectators of a brutal invasion in which actual human lives have been lost and will continue to be lost for days, weeks, months to come.\nTears well up. I just keep texting my wife that I love her, seesawing between gratitude and guilt, two halves of the human whole \u2014 to feel suffering and know that you are, for now at least, safe from it.\nmy mom and dad. two babies, one who lived in color and the other in black and white. Classic Romeo and Juliet sorta situation.\nIts not even 6am here in LA and I call my parents, just to hear their voices, to say thank you for sacrificing all that they did to get us out, to get us free. They tell me what they\u2019re hearing from friends in Ukraine, what they\u2019re hearing on the news, but the details go over my head. I am just grateful to hear them speaking, to know that at least for now we are safe.\nMy dad says he can\u2019t talk much about it too much longer without crying. That it hurts his stomach to see his homeland being invaded. And for what? For who?\nHe often reminds me that Americans don\u2019t understand freedom. Like the David Foster Wallace speech about the two fish where one fish asks the other \u201cmorning boys, hows the water?\u201d and the other fish says \u201cwhat the hell is water??\u201d.\nIn America, for better and for worse, our water is freedom.\nFreedom, a gift wasted on the free.\n\nI know this freedom is not evenly distributed in America. That so many Americans are discriminated against and face impossible hardship because of their skin color, gender, religion, sexual orientation, disability, and more.\nAnd yet, there is an important difference between life here in America and life in Russia, my dad would argue. I think he\u2019s right.\nI want to believe that you can feel grateful for a place while still criticizing it. In fact, that\u2019s the whole point \u2014 in America we are free to criticize, free to speak, protest, etc, though again, some of us are far more than others. Can\u2019t these truths coexist? I don\u2019t know.\nI want to believe two truths can coexist, that two ideas are almost never truly mutually exclusive: a more perfect union, as they wrote in one of those ancient documents everyone references all the time. Or as the Zen monk Shrunryu Suzuki said: \u201cEach of you is perfect the way you are \u2026 and you can use a little improvement.\u201d\nGrowing up, my parents always told me that I cannot fathom what life was like back in Ukraine. How impossibly hard everything was, how just going to get some bread became a hero\u2019s journey. How we lived in an apartment building with four other families all sharing a single bathroom and one of the families would routinely steal our socks. My dad really didn\u2019t like the sock stealing part \u2014 who steals socks?\nAnd he was right \u2014 who steals socks? More importantly he and my mom were right: I didn\u2019t understand.\nWhich was the whole point. They moved to America to give me the gift of not being able to understand them. To live in a place where I did not question my freedom, where I could look at my son\u2019s dumb little curly haired face and know, beyond a reasonable doubt, that he would be okay come morning.\nme and dad. the classic fish on the hook joke. also nice flat brim hat brother.\nI recently learned that when we first moved here, we lived in a small one bedroom apartment. My parents let me sleep in the bedroom and they slept in a tiny bed in the closet. Which, now, I\u2019m like \u2014 what the hell! I could have slept in the closet I was a tiny kid. But they didn\u2019t want me to know what that felt like. They wanted me to know what it meant to sleep in a room, on your own.\nA gift that, for too long, and by design, was wasted on me.\nToday, for the first time, I feel like I understand the gravity and magnitude of that gift. Watching the missiles fly over Kiev, I understand why they left. I can feel it, not as an intellectual fact, but as a lived in experience. All of a sudden their voyage to America focuses into sharp relief \u2014 no longer a fairy tale I would hear and, I am embarrassed to say, thought they were exaggerating to seem harder than it was, but a terrifying, real life decision. They left everything behind \u2014 it must have been impossible to go and even more impossible not to \u2014 how did they manage? How did they make it all work?\nMy dad often tells me I\u2019m his hero, but he\u2019s got it wrong. He and my mom \u2014 they are my heroes.\nI\u2019m like \u201cdang mom, ur like a lil baby and ur taking care of me? Props.\u201d\nI text them and tell them how grateful I am for them coming here. I want to say so much more. That I am so thankful. That I cannot imagine how hard it all was, coming here, and that I can never thank them enough. That I love them. And wish that we were in the same room so I could hug them and tell them all this in person.\nWe\u2019ve had our fair share of fights throughout the years, my parents and I. And it\u2019s funny how little all of those conflicts matter now. The very existence of all the arguments where I would argue, quite convincingly may I add, why I wanted to be an artist and not a lawyer and my mom would respond by saying \u2018see, look how good you are at arguing \u2014 you should be a lawyer!\u201d \u2014 those fights could only happen here. In America.\nvery cool parents with very strange child. also enough patterns to cause a seizure\nLast night, Before they went to sleep on the east coast, we did a Skype call so they could see their grandson. I watch him point to them and them point back to him. He won\u2019t stop pointing, his new little obsession. Like he understands some deep truth and is trying to share it with me: \u201cDad \u2014 look. Look! These are real life superheroes. They saved you.\u201d And I want to say back to him, \u201cI know, dude, I know. They came here so your dad could be free and meet your mom and have you. without them, you wouldn\u2019t be.\u201d Yes, I want him to experience existential dread as early as possible.\nI find myself becoming cynical, judging my own reaction to all this. Who am I, the privileged dude in California, to feel any certain way about this. What good is any of it?\nBut I refuse to be cynical, to be hopeless. That\u2019s the worst mistake of all \u2014 to believe nothing good can come. That\u2019s what the Putins of the world want us to believe. That we are helpless, that nothing can change.\nBut that\u2019s not true. Look at the people of Ukraine. Fighting for their country. Taking up arms. Refusing to surrender.\nmy parents w my baby. what a trip.\nThere is so much wrong with America, with the world, sure, but I cannot deny the many gifts and privileges afforded us in a moment like this.\nI could be in Ukraine right now, ready to say goodbye to my wife and my child and die for my country. Or trying to flee with my family and die at the border. Or make it out alive and spend the rest of my life a refugee, struggling to ever feel safe, ever feel home again.\nI am so fucking privileged, free to spend my days in a happy haze of the trivial, the mundane, the joyful moments of life you feel when you are safe. And then every once in a while come The Real Deal Things \u2014 poverty, cancer, war \u2014 the things that wake you up and go oh shit, none of this is a given, I am lucky, I am, dare I say, hashtag blessed.\nThis is one of those times. The door cracks open and for a second I see what life really is \u2014 fragile and beautiful and fucked and even more fragile and more beautiful as a result.\nI stand in that crack of light, from afar, sending my love.\nI stand with Ukraine. I will do whatever I can from here to help.\nAnd i stand with people of Russia too. They don\u2019t want this war \u2014 they do not want to attack their neighbor, their brother.\nThese are my people. The people whose soil I ran through for seven years, the people whose love and life and joy is a part of who I am and who my child will be.\nAnd in the same breath I think about all of the people in all of the places for whom freedom is not a given, for whom war is all they know. They are not just numbers, not just stories to be bandied around at debates \u2014 they are people. They are in Iraq and Afghanistan and Palestine and Syria and Darfur and Congo and the Uyghur region of China and Yemen and Libya and so many other places. Too many other places, full of people who would much rather scroll through Twitter while drinking their coffee and watch from afar.\nIn every conflict like this, there are real people on the ground who lose their lives, entire countries destroyed by the whims of morons (many of whom are from the US, may I add). And then there are people like me who left that country and think of it as home.\nAll wars are about people fighting and people dying. And when that war isn\u2019t about something I know personally well, I become a detached analyst trying to understand the rationale of all sides blah blah blah. But this isn\u2019t a trolley problem. This is a real real, lived truth \u2014 people live there. People will die there.\nAnd for the last week I have felt awake to that fact.\nIts so hard to talk about war and how awful it is without sounding like a cliched 1960s hippie \u2018love is all, man\u2019 sort of person. Like yea, that\u2019s great and all but the reality of life is war. Yes there are the Steven Pinkers of the world who tell us that this is the safest time in history, but fuck that. A lower quantity of deaths doesn\u2019t make a single death okay. It can\u2019t.\nSo let me say, bellbottoms on and groovy long hair on my head, war sucks. Invasions suck. Putin sucks.\nThere is evil and darkness in the world, and there is also light. And most of all, there is also a self proclaimed humor capital of the world, the place where I am from. Odessa. A land of proud people, staying to fight. And there\u2019s also an evil man in the Kremlin who has, as one tweet said, mortgaged the future of Russia for his legacy today. Fuck that guy. He will not win. He can\u2019t.\n4 generations of Dobrenkos \u2014 my grandpa, my dad, and I all born in the USSR, and my baby, born here in America, all 4 acutely aware of one thing: they come from the humor capital of the world.\nI only pray when things get really rough, and this is one of those times. I pray for the people of Ukraine, the people of Russia, and for no more deaths in that region or anywhere else. Sure its a hopeless prayer, but that doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t worth trying.\nMy son is about to wake up again, and I will give him a kiss and his smile will melt my heart and for a few seconds I will forget about all this as we say good morning to the baby animals on the wall.\nGood morning Peter the rabbit.\nGood morning Frankie the fox.\nGood morning Porky the porcupine.\nGood morning Derek the deer.\nGood morning Brownie the bear.\nGood morning Rocky the raccoon.", "comment_count": 98, "like_count": 6481, "created_time": 1646605542531, "comment": [{"user_id": "6a68f1158d55", "comment_time": 1646605542531, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "9de14dbf5117", "comment_time": 1646834897387, "comment": "Wow, thanks for that.

Not at all.\nI hope you enjoy.\nAlex\nThe Three Arguments\nWe are at the beach on what has been billed a relaxing day. The tent has been put up to protect the baby and the dog and also Helen from the sun. Me? I lay in the heat.\nI want to burn, to atone.\nAlso I tan well. I look about fifty percent more attractive with a nice tan on my face. This has been corroborated by many, refuted by none.\nThe waves crash onto the shore and I remember what a friend said recently at her father\u2019s funeral \u2014 our lives are but mere waves, rising out of the ocean, enjoying a brief time, having a laugh or two, and then returning back into the water from whence they came.\nSuch a short amount of time, the rise and fall of a single wave. And so much to do. I get anxious just thinking about it.\nBut we are at the beach and we are relaxing, so I try to relax, which, it turns out, is much harder work than actually working.\nThere\u2019s a saying in Daoism, which is pronounced with a T or a D depending on how cool you are: \u201cdo nothing and everything gets done.\u201d Now that is a great way to live. If anyone asks you to explain or prove how it works, you simply don\u2019t, as per the precept. A foolproof plan, if only one could believe it.\nWe are trying to relax and I am watching the waves that represent our brief stay on this earth rise and crash. Live and die.\n\nThe First Argument\nLet\u2019s back up. Rewind, as we say in the VCR community.\nThe day began as all family days do \u2014 with a plan. Where shall we go and when, what shall we bring and why. Upon which beach shall we lay the day away?\nWe exchange pleasantries with the AirBnB hosts who own the backhouse with the view of the Pacific Ocean from the window that we are lucky enough to pay a cool $850 USD to inhabit for two days.\nThey like how our dog, Milt, plays with their puppy, no name given. The woman in the couple wonders if raising their puppy is harder than us raising our child. We laugh, though of course its an idiotic thing to say. Puppies are little animals that pee and poo and that\u2019s that. Babies are existential threats to everything you have ever known, a life changing explosion the likes of the Big Bang or when The Big Bang Theory was first released on CBS Television on Sept 24, 2007.\nWe say thank you for the honor of paying so much for your home and head on inside. We look at the view and say \u2018wow,\u2019 both wondering what jobs we would need to switch over to in order to ever afford to live in a place like this.\nAn hour later and we\u2019re driving on the PCH approaching the dog friendly Leo Carrillo State Beach when The First Argument begins.\nMuch like Passover has Four Questions, every fight between a married couple can be understood as consisting of Three Arguments.\nIn this case, the First Argument was simple: where to park.\n\nA tradition as old as time, the debate of where we should leave our vehicle while we do whatever it is we came to do has puzzled couples through eternity. It\u2019s a perfect setup \u2014 you\u2019ve got a clear power dynamic \u2014 one drives and one passenges \u2014 fought across a minefield of each person\u2019s desperate need for control and tolerance of risk.\nYou see, reader, the beach we had chosen had a parking lot, but as we pulled in, we saw it was being blocked by a tall man in a red shirt holding a walkie talkie.\nIn Los Angeles, someone with a walkie talkie can only mean one thing: something is being filmed. In fact, if I was a criminal I would stage a film shoot so people would think that we were just doing film shoot stuff (note to editor: this may be the plot of Argo. If so, please remove this section).\nHelen and I work in the film industry. It is in fact this very industry that we were trying to get away from when taking this vacation. But alas, when it comes to Los Angeles, you can never truly escape. Anywhere you look is a shoot, or a meeting, or the diner where they shot that scene from that one movie (Swingers, its somehow always Swingers).\nThe lines between fiction and reality blur here \u2014 everything is a set, a moment for a film, a narrative for a short story that one writes not even a few days after an event takes place.\nWe open our window and I ask \u201cy\u2019all shooting something here?\u201d in the most casual, \u2018I belong here\u2019 voice I can. That\u2019s another byproduct of life in LA, at least for me (an actor and writer \u2014 you probably haven\u2019t heard of me so I won\u2019t go into more detail), is that you want everyone to think you belong. Because who knows \u2014 maybe Steven Spielberg is directing whatever is on this beach, and maybe he will hear the deep, dulcet tones of your voice coming through the walkie talkie and say \u201cHey, hey now wait a second. Who is that? That voice. I need that voice in my movie.\u201d\nAnd the next minute you\u2019re starring in a Spielberg flick, his next muse, and all is forever changed. Gone are the worries of parking and money and arguments because we\u2019ll be rich, rich and famous and we can buy a boat but not too big of a boat and \u2014 no. Stop it Hank. Focus up.\nany which way you turn, people in LA are doing this. \u2018content,\u2019 they call it\nSo there I am acting very cool and with it but for some strange reason, the tall dude says \u201cyea, sorry we\u2019re shooting today, but you can still use the beach, you just need to park up on the PCH and walk down.\u201d\nI say thank you and wait, just a second longer, to see if he follows with \u201cHey, hold on a second. I know this is crazy but um, our director, Steven \u2014 Steven Spielberg \u2014 he\u2019d like to talk to you for a minute.\u201d\nBut that does not happen so we get back on the PCH and look for a spot to park.\nLauren (change this back to whatever the name of the woman is in the story \u2014 this is important so people know this is not about you and Lauren) was nervous about parking on Route 1 because she had seen a No Parking sign.\nI try to reason with her \u2014 \u201cbut babe, look at all these other cars here on the street.\u201d\nThere were many cars and they were all on the street.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the worst that could happen?,\u201d I ask.\nAnd she looks me dead in my eyes and says \u201cmy car gets towed.\u201d\nI mean, she isn\u2019t wrong but also that is never going to happen. What are they gonna do, round up the Tow Boys and tow every single car that\u2019s parked here on the PCH? No. Never. Worst case we will get a ticket. I am about to say that I will pay for the ticket when I remember that when it comes to money, there is no me anymore, just us. I could pay, technically speaking, but it would be with our money, so we would pay, and there\u2019s not much power in a statement like that.\nAlas. We are at a stalemate and the day has not even begun. \u201cWhat can we do?\u201d, I say. \u201cThe parking law applies everywhere. Should we drive home to LA , park at our house and walk back to the beach? To be safe?\u201d\nShe does not laugh. It was a cruel joke, as was her not laughing at it.\nThe ways we hurt one another are infinite, each of us vulnerable little flowers made entirely of kryptonite. Maybe this is why we love superheroes \u2014 they are our opposite \u2014 free from pain in all ways except maybe one. We humans on the other hand, we are superheroes inverted \u2014 full of pain in all ways except for one.\nSo what is that \u2018one\u2019? Our anti-kryptonite? Love? Though I would hope so, I am not so sure.\n\nI offer a solution: Let\u2019s go and bring all our shit down to the beach. Once we have unloaded the caravan of suntan lotions, tents, hats \u2014 all coverings from the sun which, ironically, is also the very reason one goes to the beach \u2014 along with the many lil bags of lil snackies to prevent the temper tantrums that occur when the baby or I don\u2019t eat food; once all of that is safely on the beach, then I will march back to the car and see what\u2019s going on with the parking.\nHelen agrees and I walk back to the car when I realize: I am upset.\nWhat is this life of rules I have locked myself into? Where is the adventure, the risk? Will our entire vacation, nay our entire lives, be a continuation of this: anxiously fearing the world, never doing anything that might upset anyone?\nAs I walk up the stairs, my mind spirals. I wish the stairs were spiral stairs \u2014 that would make for a good image, but they are normal, boring stairs just like my normal, boring marriage.\nFinally, after about twenty minutes of walking and brooding and obsessing over how I am going to lose forty minutes of fun because of this stupid walk, I reach the road and I see the sign.\nNo Parking.\nHelen was right.\nWait. No.\nRight below \u201cNo Parking\u201d it says \u201cfrom the hours of 10pm-5am\u201d. We are fine. Just as I thought.\nIf I could bottle and sell that feeling of vindication, I\u2019d be rich.\nI walk back down to the beach and reveal the news, giddy.\nShe says, \u201cWell, now we can have fun and not be stressed.\u201d\nTo which I nod and agree, stressed out that all we do is make sure we are not stressed.\nThe rest of that first day is great, as far as I can remember. We enjoy life and laugh and watch our bundle of a baby experience sand for the first time. His lives every moment as if he\u2019s on a strong dose of LSD, and we bask in the second hand joy. He is not yet ready for the ocean though, it scares him. For the first time he truly clings to me when I try to put him down, holding onto me for dear life.\nIf only things ended there. If only there were not two more arguments waiting for us.\nThe Second Argument\nthe aforementioned view (fictional, not the actual view Alex and Lauren had when in Malibu. note to editor: how clear do we need to make this to ensure no one thinks this is an actual view? Maybe a water mark or I could draw a different couple sitting in the rocks?)\nWe wake up the next day with a view of the Pacific Ocean through our floor to ceiling window. If my family could see me now.\nThey will actually see me now, because I send them photos nearly every day of the baby.\nWe float through a morning of views and diapers and our dog Milt barking anytime we hug or high five \u2014 he mistakes the physical contact as aggression.\nWhat does Milt know that we don\u2019t?\nStanding outside watching our baby crawl through the grass, we see the AirBnB hosts, the people we\u2019ve spoken to for a sum total of five minutes yet whose advice I trust more than my own family\u2019s.\nWe tell them about the beach we went to yesterday \u2014 the dog beach, and they tell us that you can really go to any beach with a dog right now because it is March and no one is really tracking it. It\u2019s the off season. In June and July they clamp down, sure, but right now? Now is a free for all. Bring your dogs and go nuts.\nWe say thank you and head back into the house where The Second Argument shall begin.\nI say the most sane thing based on the intel we\u2019ve just collected: let\u2019s go to that super close beach.\nTo minimize travel and maximize fun. Efficient chaos.\nYesterday was great but involved a whole lot of moving about, to and fro, before any actual beach time could be enjoyed. Reminding Helen as if she wasn\u2019t there, I say \u201cWe had to park on the PCH like cavemen and walk all our shit down to the beach. We had to use stairs. STAIRS. I\u2019m sorry Helen but that? That was the U word.\u201d\nI say it jokingly but also seriously. The U word is what my dad calls \u201cunacceptable,\u201d a term he only uses when talking to customer service reps from whom he would like a refund.\nHelen disagrees and says, \u201cbut what if we can\u2019t have Milt there?\u201d\nTo which I say \u201cBut they just told us we could bring dogs no problem.\u201d\n\u201cWe already know everything about the other beach \u2014 where to park, where to go,\u201d she replies, basically making my point for me.\n\u201cRight so let\u2019s try this new one, if it sucks we\u2019ll go to the beach without parking,\u201d respond.\nShe sighs.\nI sigh.\n\u201cIt has parking normally, that was just yesterday with the film shoot and \u2014 \u201c she explains, pleading with me to understand.\nAnd I do, but I do not.\nI say yes but I feel no.\nNot once now but twice I had been rebuked, a caged animal within the \u2018freedom\u2019 of my own marriage. I was livid, but what could I do, what can any of us do, really \u2014 and so I said \u201cok fine, let\u2019s go to the beach from yesterday.\u201d\nTo which she replied \u201care you sure?\u201d\nAnd I said \u201cwell we don\u2019t really have a choice do we?\u201d\nTo which she said nothing.\nHistorians who study Helen and I\u2019s marriage will note that it was this moment, this exact moment, that would determine everything that followed.\nphoto of an actual historian \u2014 Mary Beth Norton \u2014 who will study our marriage (pending a response to my email)\nWe drove and picked up a big ol\u2019 burrito at a place called Lily\u2019s. It was the size of a newborn baby, wrapped tight in its tinfoil swaddle.\nWalking out, I pass a number of other bougie Malibu shops full of bougie Malibu people. There is an air about them \u2014 a chosen people of the waves, they think to themselves. Perhaps in 2000 years they will talk of the Malibu tribe as the people who lived here, rich and spoiled and difficult to be around but nonetheless a people unto themselves. Maybe the tribes we are in today are not those we can name but only those that can be named about us at some distant point down the road when we are long gone, captured and destroyed by colonizers a new. The circle of life, a snake eating its own tail, regrowing itself just fast enough to feast upon itself once more.\nThe burrito is great.\nI wonder what tribe Helen and I are a part of, what wrongs we are committing without even knowing about them.\nWe arrive at the beach. The parking gate is locked again, this time with nobody from a film set to tell us why.\nI look at Helen \u2014 \u201csee?\u201d\nAnd she says \u201coh shut up who cares? Let\u2019s park and walk down.\u201d\nWho cares? I care. Your husband, Helen. Me. The man you vowed to have AND to hold.\nWe park on the PCH and walk down to the beach. Twenty minutes of fun, wasted.\nWalking down, I spin out: \u201cI\u2019m getting older. Life is over. Fun is over. I am nothing more now than a vessel to care for and protect the babies (1 human, 1 dog). From now until death, this is all there is.\u201d\nMy mind races through these thoughts so fast it only catches snippets \u2014 just enough to springboard toward the next \u2014 a cacophony of worst fears building upon each other, working together \u2014 collaborating! \u2014 until they\u2019ve formed an entire self sufficient community of panic, anger and isolation within my mind.\nWe arrive at the beach, put our stuff down and, once more, I bake in the sun like a Baked Lays chip.\nHelen can always tell when something is wrong and so she asks, \u201cyou ok?\u201d\nTo which I lie and say \u201cyes.\u201d\nShe smiles, knowing I am lying.\nMy son is nearby playing with the sand. He lifts little handfuls up to his forehead and releases, watching the grains of sand fall to the ground. He is clumsy, and yet his motions are beautiful. Because he is a baby and thus not confined to the rules of the manmade world. He does what his heart desires, nothing more, nothing less.\nI long for his life, just as I am sure he longs for mine. There should be a movie about this \u2014 a classic trading places switcheroo flick where a dad and his baby son switch places. I make a mental note to call my friends in Hollywood and see what they think.\nHelen has some more of the burrito and reads her Kindle. She\u2019s deep into a book she loves and can\u2019t get out, much like I am deep into my feelings and, too, can\u2019t get out.\nThis, my dear friends, is the calm before the storm. All seems well, ideal even. Life is good \u2014 what could possibly go wrong?\nthe karma before the storm\nThe Third Argument\nHours pass. Helen takes the baby and nestles him in her bosom so that he may sleep. This is, by the way, the first time I\u2019ve felt like I could accurately and appropriately use the word bosom. These small victories are all I have left.\nI am still in the sand, direct sun oozing into my skin, all according to plan. I have been chugging water to stay hydrated and now the chicken has come to roost: I need to pee.\nI do find it weird to write pee in an essay of this scope, this heft, this gravitas, but there really is no better word. I am not about to say \u2018urinate\u2019 (too formal) or \u2018piss\u2019 (too vulgar), and so pee is all that\u2019s left. Plus that\u2019s what I would say if I was telling you this story in person.\n\nMy instinct is to find a place to pee nearby. I know there are porta-potties somewhere in the far distance, but I do not want to go to them. They are far too far and I have followed the rules for far too long. I need to make a stand.\nI look behind our tent at the seawall separating the beach from the parking lot. It\u2019s a few feet high and has a few sparse bushes and plants, a couple slight indentations that I could theoretically hide behind and pee.\nLauren (note to editor: change this to Helen so people know this story isn\u2019t about me and Lauren) is, at this point, nowhere to be seen.\nI take a look at the surroundings. There is a family that\u2019s parked their belongings far too close to us given how much space there is on the beach that day, but they are busy, distracted.\nI tell our dog Milty to stay put, which I know he will because he\u2019s scared of everything including and especially the sun, and I begin my journey toward the sandy seawall.\nMilty our dog.\nMy head on a swivel, I watch to see how my approach affects the people of the beach. Does anyone stir? Gawk? Whisper to their loved ones that the shirtless man over there is looking like he\u2019s about to pee right there on the beach? Nay.\nI also confirm that there is no one up on the parking lot coming down to the beach. The coast is, and I cannot stress this enough, clear, which is also what my pee would be in mere seconds if it weren\u2019t for Helen, who I now see walking toward me from the water.\nShe is approaching at a rapid clip with our baby nestled, asleep, in her aforementioned bosom.\nBecause the baby is sleeping, the heated conversation we are about to have takes place entirely through the mouthing of words and hand signals.\nFirst Helen mouths the words \u201cwhat are you doing?\u201d\nTo which I mouth back \u201cpeeing\u201d.\nShe moves toward me and whispers, \u201cwhat?\u201d\nAnd I mouth, more slowly and dramatically, \u201cpeeing\u201d.\nThis doesn\u2019t help because she mouths \u201cwhat?\u201d again.\nHaving no choice, I decide to mime what I\u2019m trying to say by holding up my index finger and making an arcing motion with it down into the ground as if to say \u2014 this is how I will be peeing if you would just stop asking me and drawing attention to what was going to be a fairly covert mission.\n\nHer eyes bulge ever so slightly, the sort of change only your partner of 10+ years would ever notice, and then she makes the single hand motion that takes me over the edge.\nShe looks up at me and raises an index finger of her own. A second of pause that feels like an eternity, and then she makes the \u201ccome hither\u201d motion at me, the bend of the finger toward her that makes her look like a grade school teacher ready to punish me for, once again \u2014 the third time actually, not following instructions on the playground.\nI cannot say what it was about this motion exactly, but I become inflamed with rage. Enraged, even.\nI storm toward her and before I can say anything Helen says, still in a whisper so the baby who is our light and joy and still resting in her bosom does not wake, \u201cwhat are you doing?\u201d\nAnd I reply, whisper screaming: \u201cI was going to pee over there.\u201d\nTo which she, no longer my wife but a two headed hydra made up of equal parts my mother and my first grade teacher Mrs. Trykowsky who had a special area of the chalkboard with my name permanently on it listing how many times I had to stay inside during recess, says \u201creally? here? out in the open?\u201d\nAnd there it is. All of my plans, my careful analysis of the situation, all turned to dust. To sand.\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t you just go to the porta potties right over there\u201d she whispers, pointing with the same finger she used for the \u2018come hither\u2019 motion a few seconds prior.\nI have once again been thwarted in my plans to be a free man who does not need to follow the rules at every turn. But I do not capitulate. I do not say sorry, I do not in fact say anything at all.\nI storm off like a small child, age three or so, temper tantrum in full swing.\nI hear Helen say my name, but I do not turn back.\nI then hear her say one more thing which I can\u2019t hear because of the waves and also because she\u2019s whisper screaming it in my direction. All I hear, distinctly, is the word \u201csex\u201d.\nI walk right past the scene of the \u2018crime\u2019 \u2014 the seawall \u2014 and right past a family that was heading down the steps onto the beach (I had not noticed them earlier though upon a quick inspection I am sure that they would not have minded seeing a man, turned away from them, peeing into the sand).\n\nI huff and puff my way toward the porta potties, livid about what has just happened. My agency, my freedom! Oh where oh where have they gone.\nMy family came to this country to pee where we wanted. Now look at us.\nSo what am I supposed to do, go to the porta potty like a good boy because Helen my mother told me to? No sir.\nI storm through the parking lot which infuriates me all the more because NO ONE CAN PARK THERE. IT IS EMPTY.\nThis vacation is a haunted hellscape, I realize, each joy hiding within it a dark secret that will ruin your day.\nFuck it. I walk toward some bushes at the far side of the parking lot closest to the steep hill up to the PCH, and I pee. Into the bushes.\nAnd for a second, then and there, I am free, for I have peed into the portapotty like a boy but into the bushes, like a man.\nThe joy does not last. Though I have rebelled, I am not happy.\nAnd so I keep walking, further from our tent, past the portapotties to the giant rocks seperating this beach from another beach further down the way.\nI walk back onto the sand and there, once more, the waves. They rise, they crash. We live, we die.\nI kick up the sand like I\u2019m in a cartoon and then I walk back toward our tent.\nThe Return\n\nApproaching our beach tent, I see Helen, our baby and our dog.\nHelen and I stare at each other. A game of chicken \u2014 who will speak first?\nFirst we apologize to one another with our eyes, even if we don\u2019t really know what for. Embarrassed smiles, then we speak.\n\u201cWhat were you saying as I walked away?,\u201d I ask.\n\u201cI was saying that I\u2019m pretty sure \u2014 no I know for a fact - that peeing in public will get you put on the sex offender list,\u201d she replies.\nI laugh. \u201cThat is definitely not true,\u201d I reply, not sure at all whether its true.\n\u201cYes, Hank there are kids around and if you pull out your dong in front of kids and someone reports it, you\u2019re now a registered sex offender.\u201d\nMe: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nHer: \u201c\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNo one would have reported me, babe,\u201d I say, exasperated. I thought we were in the resolution phase but this? This is not good.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know that! You were right there, in public, not hidden at all from anyone,\u201d she says.\n\u201cI was gonna do it at an angle where no one would see!\u201d I say.\n\u201cThere were people coming down from the stairs who would have seen you.\u201d she responds.\n\u201cThey weren\u2019t going to report me!\u201d I say back, and I realize there will be no end to this.\nShe gives a bottle of milk to the baby.\nAnd that\u2019s when I play the ace up my sleeve: \u201cWell. I didn\u2019t even pee in the portapotties. I peed in the bushes over there.\u201d\nI wait to see how this bombshell shakes Helen to her core.\n\u201cI knew you wouldn\u2019t,\u201d she says, not even looking over at me.\nDamn it.\nAnd so it goes. Slowly, surely, we recalibrate, back as one team of two instead of two teams of one. At best, this is what long term love can be \u2014 a proclamation that says \u2018yes, everyone on this earth is batshit, but you seem like the least batshit, so let\u2019s stick together and laugh about how insane everyone else is.\u201d\nBut here, this fight, we had become each other\u2019s unintelligible craziness. I made no sense to her, nor she me.\n\u201cI need to break rules sometimes,\u201d I say, like a five year old.\n\u201cI know Hank, I just don\u2019t want you to become a sex offender,\u201d she explains. We\u2019re looping again.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t \u2014 \u201c\n\u201cWhat will our son do if he can\u2019t go within fifty feet of his dad?\u201d\n\u201cEveryone pees on the beach! In the water, everyone is peeing does that mean I could report them all as sex offenders??\u201d\nShe pauses a second, considering, then, \u201cNo because they don\u2019t have their dicks out for the world to see! If a guy stood in the shallow water holding himself then yes without a doubt that man would be a sex offender, yes.\u201d\nAnother moment. Our baby son watches all this, observing, taking it all in.\nHe will experience a lifetime of these spats throughout his childhood. They will shape his idea of conflict, of relationship, of love. And this might just be his first. A fight about whether dad is a sex offender. I make a mental note to write this all down somewhere so that he may one day read it and share it with his therapist. It\u2019ll save him some money to be able to just give her a written record of what transpired.\nI make another mental note to write down brief reports of all the dramatic moments in his life and, when he turns 18, provide them to him in a leather-bound book. \u201cWithin these pages is all the struggle of your little world. Give it to the best therapist you can find and, god willing, within a few years you will be free of whatever it is we have done to you.\u201d\nThis act, I realize, in and of itself would then be what he talked to his therapist about.\nThere is no winning, as parents, but alas.\nthe type of notebook I would hand my son with all his trauma once he turns 18\nI look at Helen and say, \u201cThe thing that really got me was the one finger \u2018come hither\u2019 motion. You seemed like my mom.\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d she says, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok,\u201d I say, though I don\u2019t think it was.\nWe sit in silence a minute, each marinating in our own shortcomings when Helen asks, \u201cAre we doomed?\u201d\nWhoa.\nWe\u2019ve joked about this before \u2014 \u2018when do you want to get divorced? We should put it on the calendar now.\u2019 etc., but this sounds real. There is genuine fear and it shakes me. I look up in her eyes and say after perhaps a second too long of thinking \u201cno, of course we\u2019re not doomed.\u201d\nStock photos of couples fighting are a particular slice of heaven\nA few days later\nA few days later we are on a walk with the baby and the dog, back home away from Malibu and its portapotties. We run back through the events of those two days like athletes watching game tape after a particularly painful loss.\nShe tells me that she knew how high risk the move to bring up being a sex offender was \u2014 she knew both that it would piss me off in the moment and that it would make me laugh down the road. In both the comedic and marital spheres, this is a stroke of genius. To create a joke whose punchline will only land later on in the future and that this very punch line will transform the rage, the conflict from that day into something we can laugh about all while also giving her what she wanted in the moment, specifically for me not to pee on the beach but go to the portapotty instead.\nI bring up the \u201care we doomed?\u201d moment, how it really shook me.\nShe looks at me and says, \u201cyea I mean, for a second there I really did think -\u2019are we that incompatible that this is not going to end up working out?\u2019\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d I respond, convincing myself as much as her, \u201cnot at all, like \u2014 whoa hey, look at those two sunflowers!\u201d\nI point to the two lone yellow orbs sticking out of the green bushes in front of an apartment building.\nShe turns her head to see this beautiful metaphor and says \u201cHank, those are fake.\u201d\nTo which I look and see yes, obviously they are fake. How could there be two flower heads without any stems?\n\u201cI know,\u201d I say, lying.\nWe both laugh, and we walk, two waves not ready to crash back into the ocean just yet.\n", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 432, "created_time": 1649281188527, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Short Story", "Humor", "Marriage", "Relationships", "This Happened To Me"]}, {"author": "Alex Dobrenko", "post_id": "56e9731a569", "user_id": "6a68f1158d55", "title": "The ONLY Tip You Need To Become A Great Writer", "content": "The ONLY Tip You Need To Become A Great Writer\nAre you ready to change your life?\n\nNo one wants to say it, but its true.

All photos by author unless noted.\nI\u2019m sitting in the backyard with four other people. Two of them are my friends, Chase and Michael. The other two are infants.\nDon\u2019t worry, the babies aren\u2019t randos \u2014 we know these lil idiots. Chase has a one-year-old and I have a nine-month-old.\nThey are our children, and we are their dads.\nMichael, a red-bearded comedian who drives a motorcycle, asks how the whole parenting thing is going. I never know how to answer that, so I repeat the facts, slowly, as if speaking another language I\u2019ve just begun learning on Duolingo a few weeks back.\n\u201cThis. is. my. child.\u201d\n\u201cMy. son.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m. a. father. and. this. is. my. son.\u201d\nWe laugh at the absurdity of how true and yet obviously false these statements are.\nA role I cannot play\nIt feels like I\u2019m reciting dialogue for a character I could never, ever play. Dustin Hoffman and Chevy Chase and Liam Neeson and all the other actors who play dads were unavailable, so they were like \u201cOkay shit, let\u2019s get that dude Alex who still eats 60% of a salad with his bare hands in here and see if he can pull it off.\u201d And now the production is underway and here I am, playing the part of Dad, for the rest of my days.\nI am now someone who can say \u2014 and factually mean \u2014 \u201call that matters is my family.\u201d What?! That\u2019s something you hear in Westerns and WWII movies when the hero realizes, tears in her eyes, that the fame/money/whatever goal they wanted isn\u2019t what they really wanted. That what they really wanted was right under their noses the whole time.\nAnd now, that\u2019s me. Or at least it could be, theoretically. Like there is nothing stopping me from walking into Ralphs to buy some Diet Coke and baby food and saying proudly to the cashier: \u201cAll that matters is my family.\u201d\nIn my backyard, the conversation continues \u2014 Chase and I taking turns practicing the language, hoping that if we use it enough it will stop sounding so weird coming out of our mouths:\n\u201cHow. is. your. son?\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s. the. newest. thing. he\u2019s. doing?\u201d\nNo matter how much we say it, it still feels forced, like a \u201cdonde esta la biblioteca\u201d in Spanish 101. And yet unlike that high school freshman year class, this is now our lives.\nWe have been dropped into Mexico with no guide, no training, and no one here speaks a word of English. Cool beans.\nA caveat: The role of adult\nMy mom, the baby, with her baby, me.\nPart of why this is so weird for us, this language of Dad, is that we\u2019ve lived a whole long time as Adults (Without Babies). We are both 34 \u2014 fun fact, I\u2019m actually two days older than Chase \u2014 so, since turning 18 we\u2019ve each had 16 years of time to be adults, to live our lives, to learn and speak and master the language of Adult (Without Baby). 16 years! That\u2019s a long frickin\u2019 time.\nMy mom had me when she was 21 and my dad was 23. Youngins! They cannot understand the brutal pain of getting to live a full life before having a kid. Sure your struggle in Ukraine getting food for us might have been tough, but you never had to make jokes about how hard it is to speak about your kids with your 34-year-old friends!! That\u2019s real struggle! (Note: Delete this part before showing your parents.)\nA warzone\nActual photo of me and my wife waiting for some shit to go down.\nWhen people ask me what being a dad is like, I usually respond like this: \u201cYou ever been in war? It\u2019s sort of like that. Nothing happens 90% of the time but at any point, someone could die.\u201d\nSometimes they laugh, sometimes they look at me with concern. Either way, I squint my eyes as if remembering Vietnam and continue: \u201cYou live in constant fear, the slightest noise hurtling you out of sleep \u2014 is he crying? Is he alive? Oh, it\u2019s nothing? Fuck.\u201d\nAnd it\u2019s true \u2014 you as parents are the only thing that stands between this blob and a near-certain death in this world. Cool cool.\nLike right now, as I write this, I know he\u2019s in the bathroom. He crawled over there and yep, I can hear the splish-splash of his little mini sausage fingers wading through the toilet water which could quite possibly be pee water (we do not flush every time because we are trying to save the environment you sickos).\nHere\u2019s the kicker \u2014 I am on the couch and it feels so comfy and cozy and maybe I can just let him splash around in the water-that-may-be-pee for a second or two longer. This is who I have become. It is a war and already I am losing.\nI wait a few more seconds, okay maybe a minute, okay maybe a few minutes but eventually, I do get up and walk over to see what was going on. Here\u2019s what I found:\nDo not judge our bathroom. We are new parents. We are barely alive.\nDeath by 1,000 paper cuts\nThe only image of Lingchi I could find that wasn\u2019t way too intense to share here.\nI once heard that Osama Bin Laden\u2019s strategy for destroying America was \u201cdeath by 1,000 paper cuts,\u201d which also happens to be a great way to describe parenting. None of the moments in and of themselves are all that painful, but together over the course of a lifetime, they will destroy you.\nThe origin of this phrase is an actual process of torture and execution used in China called Lingchi, or \u2018death by a thousand cuts\u2019 and is described as a form of execution where \u201ca knife was used to methodically remove portions of the body over an extended period of time, eventually resulting in death.\u201d (source)\nAccording to the Wikipedia article, the western perception of the practice is incorrect \u2014 it\u2019s not that the person is kept alive for 1,000 cuts until they die \u2014 the death itself happens fairly quickly with the majority of cuts happening afterward.\nWhich, again, feels like parenting. The death of Alex the Adult happens soon after the baby is born, but the cuts continue long thereafter until someday in the distant future I wake up and realize that I have been spiritually reborn: A phoenix rising out of ashes but instead of a phoenix I\u2019m more of a hairy 5 foot 6 inch man who is balding but mostly on the back of his head so you can\u2019t see it yet, a man who can somehow speak the language of Dad with confidence and aplomb.\nAt least that\u2019s what I hope will happen. I\u2019m only nine months in, so like only 30\u201340 cuts of the way through, hence my fumbling the language of Dad so bad. Cool cool cool.\nAnd also, a forehead kiss\nYes, officer, this is the lil idiot who is trying to kill me.\nI do want to say, in the interest of fairness and also to ensure I am not disowned by my family \u2014 it\u2019s not all bad. There are moments, each a few seconds long at most, that are somehow better than anything I\u2019ve ever experienced before in my life.\nFor example \u2014 my wife Lauren was at work (she currently supports our family financially while I sit around letting the baby play in pee water), so we played peekaboo over FaceTime. She would take her black N95 mask on and off, giving him a big ol\u2019 cheesy smile every time she revealed her face, and he would LOSE HIS SHIT. Laughing like she had made THE BEST joke of all time.\nWhat got me was how he laughed. It was a laugh that was deep in him \u2014 he would cock his head back and to the side, so you could see two lil nubs of his two top teeth showing \u2014 a laugh of recognition that said \u201cahhhh there she goes again!\u201d like he had seen this 100 times and loved it every single time. He really couldn\u2019t help himself, that\u2019s how funny it was, over and over and over again. This wasn\u2019t a fart joke or someone slipping on a banana peel either \u2014 this was deep, this was true, something that made our baby dig deep into his soul and think, \u201cThis. This right here is the human experience.\u201d\nOur babysitter Jess pointed out how insane it is that babies laugh before doing almost anything else. Before crawling, walking, talking, or the millions of other milestones they\u2019ll have in their life, they can understand a good joke. Comedic timing, delivery, it\u2019s all there already, from day one. Jess said, \u201cMaybe that \u2014 comedy \u2014 is what separates us from everyone else.\u201d\nThinking back to his laughing I can\u2019t help but agree, low-key blown away by the profundity therein.\nHe asked me to also include this photo with a caption of \u201clife is a comedy born of tragedy.\u201d\nMoments like these aren\u2019t paper cuts, of course. They are forehead kisses that burrow into the depths of my soul. They say \u201chey, I love you\u201d in a language I don\u2019t yet understand, the language of Dad which I am just starting to get the hang of and may never truly become fluent in \u2014 perhaps that\u2019s not even the point.\nPerhaps the point is simply to enjoy the dance of how that language evolves over time. Like my dad is probably still learning how to speak Dad with me, especially now that I am Dad too. In this way we\u2019re all Dads fumbling our way through understanding each other, mostly failing and yet trying nonetheless.\nAnd yet the death of my Adult self is still real and has most definitely transpired in a way I cannot yet fully articulate.

He sampled many religious delicacies, from Christianity to Islam, but it was the Hindu Bhagavad Gita that reliably satisfied his hunger.\nThe spiritual poem opens with Prince Arjuna, a great warrior, poised for battle. But he\u2019s lost his nerve. Not only is he weary of bloodshed, he\u2019s discovered the opposing army includes soldiers from his own clan. How can he fight them? Lord Krishna, disguised as Arjun\u2019s charioteer, counsels him.\nThe conventional interpretation of the Gita is that it\u2019s an exhortation to duty, even violence,. After all (spoiler alert!), Krishna ultimately convinces Arjuna to wage war against his own kin. Gandhi read it differently. The Gita, he said, is an allegory for \u201cwhat takes place in the heart of every human being today.\u201d The true battlefield lies within.\nOne tenet of the Gita is nonattachment to results. \u201cYou have the right to work, but never to the fruit of work,\u201d Krishna tells Arjuna. \u201cYou should never engage in action for the sake of reward, nor should you long for inaction.\u201d Sever effort from outcome, the Gita teaches. Invest 100 percent effort into every endeavor and precisely zero percent into the results. Gandhi summed up this outlook in a single word: \u201cdesirelessness.\u201d\nWhen I first read the Gita, I balked at this whole nonattachment-to-results notion. Isn\u2019t it an invitation to indolence, a handy, Eastern-spiced excuse for planting yourself on the couch and binge-watching British baking shows?\nNo, it isn\u2019t, and after many years and many hard-earned lessons I have embraced \u2014 if not always practiced \u2014 Gandhi\u2019s way. Expectations, I\u2019ve come to learn, are the great enemy of happiness. To expect something, anything, of a person or place or job is to make demands of it, ones that can\u2019t always be met. Disappointment is sure to follow, a setback we\u2019re quick to blame on the stars or something we ate \u2014 anything, really, except where the fault truly lies: our outsized expectations.\nAn important distinction: having no expectations isn\u2019t the same as having low expectations. Low expectations are merely high expectations in disguise, a mind game we play in an attempt to shield ourselves from disappointment. (Spoiler alert: It doesn\u2019t work.) People with no expectations are not slackers. They do a lot, except worry about results.\nThis is not our way. We are results-oriented. Fitness trainers, business consultants, doctors, colleges, dry cleaners, dieticians, financial advisors. They, and many others, promise results. We might question their ability to deliver results, but rarely do we question the underlying assumption that being results-oriented is good.\nGandhi was not results-oriented. He was process-oriented. He made no distinction between means and ends. For him, the means \u00adwere the ends. How you achieve your goals is more important than whether you achieve them. The delicious irony is that this process-oriented approach produces better results than a results-oriented one.\nIn a landmark study, Teresa Amabile, a psychologist at Harvard University, found that expectation of a reward or evaluation, even a positive evaluation, squelched creativity. She calls this phenomenon the intrinsic theory of motivation. \u201cPeople will be most creative when they feel motivated primarily by interest, enjoyment, satisfaction, and the challenge of the work itself \u2014 not by external pressures,\u201d she said.\nNot only does living expectations-free soften the sting when life goes sideways, as it inevitably does, it frees us up for the possibility of unexpected delight, what the writer Robert Grudin calls \u201cthe beauty of sudden seeing.\u201d\nSome people know this intuitively. So do some nations. Like the Danes. They consistently rank among the happiest nations in the world, yet they also report, via the Eurobarometer survey, consistently modest expectations.\nThe pandemic has changed everything \u2014 and nothing. It might seem like life is more uncertain, that less is under our control. This is an illusion. The world has always been a fickle place, bound to laugh at our grand plans, at our expectations. The pandemic has merely laid bare this essential truth: we enjoy life the most when we expect the least from it.", "comment_count": 6, "like_count": 486, "created_time": 1634140812683, "comment": [{"user_id": "148596cf11bd", "comment_time": 1634140812683, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "2fbd98d9592d", "comment_time": 1634663443476, "comment": "Good article."}, {"user_id": "c487140a6967", "comment_time": 1634396737756, "comment": "\"The delicious irony is that this process-oriented approach produces better results than a results-oriented one.\" Any study that supports this claim?"}, {"user_id": "f32a43479fa", "comment_time": 1634579282508, "comment": "Reading Gandhi ji will enlighten you enough that you will understand that happiness is all about \"being simple\"."}, {"user_id": "2c02978b4454", "comment_time": 1634507176799, "comment": "For fear of death: Anil Seth, \"Being You.\""}, {"user_id": "43eda08cc27b", "comment_time": 1634427478777, "comment": "\"Gandhi summed up this outlook in a single word: \u201cdesirelessness.\u201d You might want to read about Gandhi's desires and what that meant for the women and girls in his life, especially his grandnieces."}, {"user_id": "46dd478afc75", "comment_time": 1634784826749, "comment": "Yes and it seems when you are process-oriented, you are mostly motivated internally."}], "post_tag": ["Happiness", "Gandhi", "Expectations", "Self Improvement", "Mindfulness"]}, {"author": "Eric Weiner", "post_id": "c12cfe3a2d1a", "user_id": "148596cf11bd", "title": "Death by A Million Tweets: 2025\u2019s Hit TV Series", "content": "Death by A Million Tweets: 2025\u2019s Hit TV Series\nA schadenfreude premonition\nPhoto by dmoberhaus.\nIt was unclear if Mr. Musk\u2019s takeover bid and plan to turn the publicly traded Twitter into a private company will work, and he provided few details about how he would pay for it. \u2014 The New York Times, April 14, 2022\nSound of a keyboard clicking. A date appears on the screen: July 14, 2024. The camera pans across a wood-paneled Senate hearing room. We hear the sound of cameras whirring, as a male of indeterminate age and species enters the room. Camera zooms in for a tight shot of the man, who sits down casually behind a microphone. He is not sweating. Or blinking. Cue dialogue.\nSenator Gasbag: \u201cMr. Musk, you bought Twitter in 2022 for, let me see, 29 gazillion dollars. \u201c\nMusk: \u201c29.5 gazillion dollars, Senator.\u201d\nSenator Gasbag: \u201cI stand corrected. 29.5 gazillion dollars. But why? You were already the richest man in the world. Why buy a social media platform?\u201d\nMusk: \u201cWhy did Hillary climb Everest? Why did Putin invade Ukraine? Because it was there and because they could. I am a maverick, Senator. I take things that are broken and fix them. Sometimes I fix things that aren\u2019t broken, that are, in fact, perfectly fine. This was one of those cases.\u201d\nSenator Gasbag: \u201cWell, things didn\u2019t exactly turn out as you planned?\u201d\nMusk: \u201cSenator, if it\u2019s okay with you. I\u2019d like to answer that question with an emoji.\u201d\nSenator Gasbag: \u201cNo, it is not okay, young man. Use your words.\u201d\nMusk: \u201cNo, Senator, things did not turn out as planned. I flew too close to the sun. My wings melted.\u201d\nSenator Gasbag: \u201cNot only your wings, son, but America\u2019s. The entire nation is paying the price for your little adventure. Do you realize that?\u201d\nMusk: \u201cI do, Senator. But I assure you I had the best of intentions.\u201d\nFade to black. We flash back to April, 2022. Camera pans across a room of absurdly young, absurdly wealthy vegans. The Twitter board. The sound of heated debate ricochets across the sparsely furnished room. The board is clearly divided on whether to accept Musk\u2019s offer to buy Twitter.\nBoard Member A: \u201cI say we accept his offer. I mean, look what he did for electric vehicles and commercial space travel and, well, trolling. What could possibly go wrong?\u201d\nBoard Member B: \u201cExcuse me, but are you #nuts? The man wants to install an edit button. An edit button! Oh, and he\u2019ll probably reinstate Trump on the platform. But an edit button! Do you realize the implcatns\u2026.implcastions\u2026implications? I am #disappointed in you guys.\u201d\nBoard Member C: \u201cOkay, let\u2019s stay #calm people. We\u2019ve built a terrific platform with millions of loyal followers. Musk is rich and reckless, sure, but how much damage can one man do?\u201d\nWe cut to a large convention hall. The room is filled with men, and only men. They are holding signs that read \u201cHate Speech is Still Speech\u201d and \u201cIf You Can Think It, You Can Say It\u201d and \u201cMy Right to Swing My Fist Begins at Your Nose.\u201d Many are wearing lapel pins with a photograph of their hero: Elon Musk. The group\u2019s leader, a wiry man wearing a T-shirt with a large \u201cZ\u201d emblazoned on it, bounds onto the stage and, microphone in hand, addresses the crowd.\n\u201cGentlemen and Gentlemen: We are gathered here to celebrate year two of Absolute Free Speech. It was not that long ago, I remind you, when we couldn\u2019t express our most vile thoughts. And do you recall, men, when we were banned \u2014 banned! \u2014 from making death threats? Well, those dark days are now behind us, I am happy to report. Long live Elon!\u201d\nCamera pans the crowd. Their fists are raised. They are sweating. A rhythmic chant builds to a crescendo. \u201cElon! Elon! Elon.\u201d Fade.\nWe cut to an orbiting space station. A lone figure is floating in zero-gravity, exiled and forlorn. In his hand is a smartphone. Camera zooms tight onto the image of a gloved hand, typing. The glove makes it difficult to type. The man makes many mistakes and keeps hitting backspace. Finally, he types the proper numbers and we hear a phone ring.\n\u201cGreetings, Donald, I mean, Mr. President.\u201d\n\u201cElon. Is that you?\u201d\n\u201cYes, sir. I was just wondering.

Here\u2019s What I Learned.\nThe real benefit is measured in hours, not dollars\nPhoto: Chris Booth\nI\u2019m not sure where this minimalist urge came from. I\u2019ve always been more of a maximalist, as one glance at my bag collection (54 at last count) or my coffee-maker constellation (six, more or less) or my leather-notebook ensemble (don\u2019t ask). Enough, I decided. This must stop.\nI know many people dismiss the efficacy of New Year\u2019s resolutions, but I like them. They help me make vital course corrections. So, on January 1st I resolved to buy nothing. No bags, notebooks, coffee paraphernalia, clothes, electronics. Nothing. The only exceptions I made were for food and medicine, as well as gifts. Why deprive others because of my resolution, I figured?\nI took this vow of nothing not for masochistic reasons or ecological ones, or out of some latent ascetic impulse. It was, rather, a nagging feeling that I was squandering my precious life energy on\u2026.crap. Not just the accumulation of crap but the curation of it, the hours spent searching not for any V90 dye-free coffee filter but the best V90 dye-free coffee filter. Always the best, always more. It was exhausting.\nI\u2019m proud to report: I did it. For the past one hundred days, I have bought nothing. Here is what I\u2019ve learned:\n1. Targeted Ads Made This Difficult At First\nApparently the digital gnomes that create targeted ads didn\u2019t get the memo about my newfound minimalism. I was still bombarded with ads for bags, notebooks, coffee paraphernalia and various other products that I have trouble resisting. The digital gnomes were-persistent, and ruthless. The less I bought the more they bombarded me with ads, as if to say Come on Eric, we know you want to buy this contrast-stitching waxed canvas field bag. Just push the buy button, just\u2026.NO! I refused. One by one, I clicked on \u201cNot interested in this and\u201d and \u201cThis ad is not relevant\u201d and even \u201cThis ad is offensive\u201d until the gnomes finally relented and let me browse the Internet in peace.\n2. I Don\u2019t Miss Anything\nI thought I\u2019d pine for all my stillborn purchases. I did not. I can honestly say I don\u2019t miss a single purchase not made. Yes, it took willpower and some gnome cancelling (see above) to reach this liberated state but once I arrived there was no going back. Just as vegetarians no longer crave meat, I no longer crave stuff.\nMy project isn\u2019t about minimalism per se \u2014 after all, I still own a lifetime\u2019s worth of accumulated stuff. It is about a shift in mentality from having to being. I am now an unconsumer. Yes, I still gaze occasionally at the vast materialist landscape \u2014 commercials, storefronts, unboxing videos \u2014 but it is a distant and alien landscape. Like the surface of Mars, I know it exists, but I am not an astronaut and have no desire to visit.\n3. I Have More Free time. A Lot More\nThis is perhaps the greatest benefit to being an unconsumer: time. Hours and minutes are the only true resources we possess \u2014 or more precisely, borrow \u2014 yet you would never know it watching people (including myself, until recently) squandering time on stuff. It\u2019s not the actual purchasing of said stuff \u2014 that takes mere seconds \u2014 but the time invested in all those purchase-adjacent activities. Amazon reviews. YouTube videos. Friends weighing in, whether they were asked or not.\nNever before has it been so easy to buy so much stuff, and yet it feels more time consuming than ever. We devote countless hours \u2014 days! \u2014 to finding the best stuff, tracking the arrival of our stuff, learning how to operate our stuff, repairing our stuff, misplacing our stuff, reviewing our favorite stuff (so that others may buy more stuff), and returning stuff we don\u2019t like. As an unconsumer, I have catapulted myself clear of this insanity.\nI recently took my Mom to Costco to be fitted for hearing aids. I had an hour or so to kill while the audiologist did her work. Normally, I would have spent that hour surveying the aisles with hungry, consumer eyes. Not this time. My boundaries were clear. If I can\u2019t swallow it or gift it, I can\u2019t buy it. I spent the hour reading a novel that had languished, unopened, on my bookcase for years.\n4. I\u2019m Not Saving Much Money\nThis one surprised me. I thought that, surely, with a prohibition on amassing stuff I would save money. I did not. My credit card bills hardly dipped at all. How can this be?\nOne reason is that my various purchases never amounted to that much money in the first place. Their real cost was exacted in hours, not dollars. Another reason is that while I did not buy any stuff, I did spend money on experiences: movies, vacations, gym memberships. All allowed because, as several studies show, money spent on experiences generates a much bigger happiness boost than money spent on stuff. And unlike that large screen TV, a vacation doesn\u2019t clutter your living room or need constant updating. It leaves no sticky residue.\nThere\u2019s one more explanation for my persistent credit card bills, which brings me to my fifth and final outcome of one hundred days of buying nothing.\n5. I Am More Generous\nAs I said, I purposefully carved out an exemption for gifts. I can spend all the money I want on others. And I did: a necklace for my wife, a sweatshirt for my daughter, a new memory-foam bed for my dog. Not only did this permit me to behave altruistically, it also gave me a chance to scratch that old consumer itch without violating my buy-nothing oath. It is a gentle scratching, though, not the abrasive, crazed scraping that marked my before-life. Other people\u2019s stuff, it turns out, doesn\u2019t weigh you down. In fact, the act of giving lightens your load.\nThat\u2019s just one of the reasons why I\u2019m extending my buy-nothing policy for another one hundred days.", "comment_count": 13, "like_count": 512, "created_time": 1649187123328, "comment": [{"user_id": "148596cf11bd", "comment_time": 1649187123328, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "b1e59d81ed20", "comment_time": 1649395480791, "comment": "Great article and refreshing writing style.

Play in a Sandbox", "content": "Stuck Creatively? Play in a Sandbox\nThe hidden power of time without consequence\nPhoto by Ostap Senyuk on Unsplash\nA century ago, the prolific novelist Frank Norris penned a line that has become a bellwether of authors everywhere: \u201cDon\u2019t like to write, but like having written.\u201d\nBut how do we get from writing to having written? Much ink has been spilled in an attempt to answer that question. I humbly offer a one-word solution: sandbox.\nWhen I am stuck, which is often, I create a new Word file and label it, in all caps, SANDBOX. Sometimes I create multiple sandboxes, one for each chapter or scene. Then I play. My fingers fly across the keyboard, liberated from the tyranny of consequences.\nDo my sandbox sessions lead to publishable prose? No. More often that not it\u2019s pure gibberish, but that\u2019s okay. The point of the sandbox is not to produce polished prose but to get my hand moving, to free myself from the stranglehold of my internal editor. He is a bully and rule-number one of the sandbox is: no bullies allowed. Rule number two is: no adults allowed. The sandbox is where I can play like a child, without an iota of self-consciousness or shame.\nI once read that the novelist Donna Tartt writes at the top of each page of a draft THIS DOESN\u2019T COUNT. This is the way of the sandbox. If it doesn\u2019t count, there are no repercussions, real or imagined, for writing utter rubbish. If it doesn\u2019t count you are free to fail and if you are free to fail you are free to create.\nSandboxes are not meant to last, or to be seen by others. These are private worlds where judgment takes a holiday.\nGeniuses instinctively recognize the power of the sandbox. The 11th-century Chinese polymath Su Tungpo described his painting technique as \u201cplay with ink\u201d and, according to his biographer, \u201cwielded his poet\u2019s pen almost as if it were a toy.\u201d When Alexander Fleming, the scientist who discovered penicillin, was asked what he did, he replied, \u201cI play with microbes.\u201d\nAnother famously playful scientist, physicist Richard Feynman, wrote that he enjoyed his \u201cwork\u201d most when he was simply playing. \u201cI used to do whatever I felt like doing \u2014 it didn\u2019t have to do with whether it was important for the development of nuclear physics, but whether it was interesting and amusing for me to play with.\u201d\nYou don\u2019t need to be a genius to benefit from the power of play. In one study, British researchers Patrick Bateson and Daniel Nettle asked some 1,500 people to rank their playfulness on a scale of one to seven. They then asked them to devise different uses for two everyday objects: a paperclip and a jar of jam. The respondents who regarded themselves as playful \u201cwere much more likely\u201d to give lots of uses for the objects.\nThat doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they were good uses. Most of what we create in the sandbox should stay in the sandbox. Geniuses fail more often than non-geniuses. Thomas Edison held 1,093 patents, most for completely worthless inventions. Of Picasso\u2019s twenty thousand works, most were far from masterpieces.\nAs for literature, W. H.

The purpose of dominance politics is to attack, attack, attack, and make it appear that the opponent has not fought back. To quote Marshall, \u201cSomeone who can\u2019t or won\u2019t defend themselves certainly isn\u2019t someone you can depend upon to defend you\u201d. (As a side note, the \u201cpopularism\u201d debate that is currently roiling the Democratic consultant class in some ways revolves around whether Democrats have fought back hard enough against Republicans dominance politics over the years.) Republicans\u2019 decades-long game of dominance politics reached its apogee with Donald Trump. Trump is the supreme master of dominance politics, which is not surprising when you consider he is a serial sexual predator, and he has used his mastery to destroy Democrats and Republicans alike. As Marshall also notes, \u201cthe inherent appeal of power and the ability to dominate others\u2026has a deep appeal to America\u2019s authoritarian right\u201d. And I would not be the first to note that, for much of America, the Trump presidency, and now even its aftermath, has been akin to being in an abusive relationship.\nFor many American workers, the Trump presidency just brought to the political arena an element of abuse that they were enduring at the workplace. Ever since Reagan destroyed PATCO and the emergence of globalization, American workers have been abused by their employers at all levels of the wage scale. The wages for full-time employees at Walmart and other large retailers still leave a family of three earning below the poverty line, leaving American taxpayers to actually subsidize those workers. The psychological distress and family disruption caused by unpredictable work schedules has been well documented. Wage theft is rampant, with the Economic Policy Institute estimating that workers lose over $8 billion a year to wage theft, misclassification of jobs, and minimum wage violations in just the 10 most populous states.\nEven under revised regulation, truckers can work 70 hour weeks and long-haulers only are required to be given four hours of rest from 1am to 4am on two consecutive nights as well as potentially forced to do 11 hours straight of driving. (Wage theft is also rampant in the trucking business, with LA and Long Beach port drivers recently winning a $30 million settlement from XPO Logistics for paying them below the minimum wage.) Amazon drivers have to resort to peeing in bottles and even defecating inside their trucks in order to maintain the delivery quotas set by the company. Poultry workers wear diapers because they are prevented from taking bathroom breaks.\nSuch employee abuse is not just limited to lower wage industries. Up until the mid-1980s, medical interns were expected to work 90\u2013100 hour weeks with shifts sometimes lasting as long as 36 hours. Current recommendations still allow 80 hour weeks and up to 24 hour shifts. At Goldman Sachs, junior bankers recently complained of 100 hour weeks, describing their working conditions as \u201cbeyond the level of \u2018hard-working\u2019, this is inhumane/abuse\u201d. Goldman management responded by giving them Saturdays off, which was probably routinely violated and only left workers who actually took that day with less time to complete the same amount of work. (In light of such abuse, it really shouldn\u2019t be shocking that Wall Street produces sociopaths like Steve Bannon and Martin Shkreli.)\nFor years, employers have had the upper hand, treating employees as easily replaceable parts and threatening workers with moving jobs to lower wage parts of the country or offshoring them entirely. As Harold Myerson notes, since Reagan, \u201cmajor corporations actually began provoking strikes because they felt they could either get the union to accept far worse pay and working conditions\u2026or just let the members go and hire replacements\u201d. But now it appears that the tables have turned and that the pandemic has finally created an environment where workers are refusing to tolerate employer abuse any longer. The latest unemployment report highlighted what is being called the \u201cGreat Resignation\u201d, with workers leaving their jobs in droves across virtually all industries.\nSince April, a record number of Americans have quit their job in each successive month. In August alone, nearly 7% of all hotel and restaurant workers told their employer to shove it. During the pandemic, low wage workers who have been told for decades that they are expendable and easily replaced suddenly became \u201cessential\u201d and \u201cheroes\u201d. But their pay and the working conditions that put them at a significant risk of death certainly never reflected that status, so they are leaving their jobs in droves, presumably filling the record number of job openings in other businesses that offer better pay and less abuse. As one worker declared, \u201cwhen you realize your boss will kill you, it changes y[ou]r relationship to work\u201d. The wave of resignations may actually be building on itself as employers find it difficult to replace workers under current conditions and wages and are forced to make the remaining workers do even more to keep the business going. This additional burden creates even more burnout in existing staff, who then also quit. In addition, retail employees are exhausted by the abuse they are receiving from customers whose nerves have also been fried by the pandemic. It\u2019s a perfect storm of abuse leading to a massive exodus from jobs.\nBeyond the essential workers, others who have been forced to stay at home during the pandemic may have also discovered just how out of whack their work-life balance had become. As Derek Thompson writes, because of the pandemic \u201c[m]ore families today work at home, cook at home, care for kids at home, entertain themselves at home, and even school their kids at home\u2026By eliminating the office as a physical presence in many (but not all!) families\u2019 lives, the pandemic may have downgraded work as the centerpiece of their identity\u201d. Obviously, government support in the form of pandemic relief checks, rent moratoriums, and student loan payment suspensions made altering employees\u2019 work-life balance far easier, but many may have realized that they can actually get by with less. Thompson continues, \u201c[W]e may instead look back to the pandemic as a crucial inflection point in something more fundamental: Americans\u2019 attitudes toward work. Since early last year, many workers have had to reconsider the boundaries between boss and worker, family time and work time, home and office\u201d.\nThe current wave of resignations is also being matched by a wave of strikes across multiple industries, another indication of workers\u2019 intolerance for abuse and the chance to improve their conditions. \u201cStriketober\u201d, as it is being called, has seen work stoppages and strike votes among Hollywood TV and film crews, Alabama coal miners, John Deere factory workers, Buffalo health care employees, California nurses, and Kellogg and Nabisco cereal producers and bakers. An even more surprising indication of increased worker power is the recent Gallup poll that showed that public approval of unions stands at 65%, the highest level since 1965. All this labor action follows successful teacher strikes and unionization in the media industry over the last couple of years.\nThis record support for unions also coincides with what initially appears to be the most pro-worker administration in generations. While the PRO act will once again probably die in Congress, the administration looks prepared to take on the massive misclassification of jobs and rampant wage theft, real anti-trust enforcement, and expanding overtime regulations that died with the election of Trump in 2016, in addition to finding ways to make it easier for workers to organize.\nAt the same time Americans\u2019 attitude toward work is apparently changing, the pandemic is also highlighting the critical weaknesses of the globalized, just-in-time economy that has been built over the last few decades. The links in the supply chain are weak and fragile and there are virtually no redundancies built into the system. The problems are exacerbated by the decades-long failure of anti-trust enforcement resulting in highly concentrated industries in which there is little actual competition. Hurricanes that devastate Puerto Rico create a shortage of IV bags because that\u2019s where most of them are manufactured. COVID outbreaks in Taiwan create a shortage of semiconductors. A coup in Guinea creates a shortage of bauxite needed to manufacture aluminum. COVID, flooding, or an economic downturn in China can create shortages of goods around the world, simply because China has become integral to much of the world\u2019s supply chain.\nThe current supply chain disruptions are not just due to increased post-pandemic demand or shortages of employees, but are a structural problem of globalization. As David Dayen writes, \u201cWith its thin margins and consolidated structure, the globalization of production magnifies disruptions of any type\u201d. Matt Stoller adds, \u201cThe consolidation of power over supply chains in the hands of Wall Street, and the thinning out of how we make and produce things over forty years in the name of efficiency, has made our economy much less resilient to shocks. These shortages are the result\u201d. There is now a fear that, even post-pandemic, supply chain disruption and resulting shortages will be with us for years to come. As one supply chain software executive declared, \u201cThere is no end in sight. Everybody should be assuming we are going to have an extended period of disruptions\u201d.\nHarold Myerson has compared the current moment to the post-World War I and post-World War II labor revolutions in America. In both cases, Americans who had put their life on the line and been labeled as \u201cheroes\u201d returned to the work force but refused to accept the jobs that were on offer. Today\u2019s \u201cheroes\u201d, to quote Myerson, \u201care often in some of the most low-paying, no benefit, and often unable to control one\u2019s work hours\u2026to which workers\u2019 response is \u2018We don\u2019t want to go back\u2019\u201d. Combine employees\u2019 reassessment of work with the most pro-worker administration in decades and the structural failings of the existing globalized, just-in-time economy, and we might just be on the verge of seeing the greatest transformation for workers since the destruction of the Reagan era, this time in labor\u2019s favor. One can only hope so.\nOriginally published at https://thesoundings.com on October 17, 2021.", "comment_count": 6, "like_count": 349, "created_time": 1634489423153, "comment": [{"user_id": "52a5f989cdbb", "comment_time": 1634489423153, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "7541e57abbdd", "comment_time": 1634794329945, "comment": "by the time reagan was elected president, wage suppression had already been locked in (since the nixon economic shock policy of 1971) and the business community had set in motion most of the powell memo recommendations (pro-biz \"think\" tanks, regulatory capture, just to name a couple strategies)."}, {"user_id": "6aa436a7010", "comment_time": 1634619784856, "comment": "Excellent, excellent.

Although Russia has retreated and consolidated its forces in the north of Ukraine, intelligence estimates indicate that this is just a preparation for a new offensive with the express purpose of basically consolidating control over the three eastern oblasts of Ukraine and preserving a land link with Crimea. If Putin has shown us anything over the years, however, it\u2019s that retreat and defeat can only be temporary and he is willing to play a very long game in order to win. As he has shown time and time again, if he waits long enough and helps the process along, the West will become distracted and divided and he can try, try again. And this time he may not need to wait that long before he can strike at all of Ukraine again for a third time.\nIn 1994, Russia attempted to put down a rebellion in the neighboring republic of Chechnya. Despite turning its capital, Grozny, to rubble in the same way they are destroying Mariupol and other cities in eastern Ukraine, two years later the Russians were forced to leave Chechnya in total defeat. Yet, three years later, within weeks after Putin came to power, he used what is believed to be a false flag operation of apartment building bombings that killed hundreds of Russians to once again invade Chechnya, which had basically become a failed state after the devastation of the first war. This second Chechen war was perhaps even more brutal and filled with war crimes than the first and only officially ended in 2009 with the Russians installing a seemingly psychotic warlord to rule the region. For Russia and Putin, patience and unimaginable brutality finally carried the day in a minor and strategically unimportant region after 15 long years. One can only imagine the price he will be willing to pay for a far more strategically and economically important country like Ukraine.\nIn fact, Putin has now played an even longer game in Ukraine than he did in Chechnya. In the 2004 Ukrainian election, economic reformer Viktor Yushchenko faced off against the hand-picked successor of then President Leonid Kuchma, Viktor Yanukovych. As opposed to Kuchma, who had tried to tightrope an almost Tito-like balance between Russian and the West, Yanukovych was very much pro-Russian and his base of support was in the more Russian-speaking areas of eastern Ukraine such as Donetsk. Yushchenko was not permitted to campaign in Yanukovych strongholds and was poisoned just two months before the election but survived. It is hard not to see Putin\u2019s hand behind the poisoning considering all the other poisonings of Putin opponents over the years, although the Ukrainian security services probably delivered the actual toxins.\nThat election ended in dispute, with Yanukovych winning the initial vote amidst charges of widespread fraud that set off the original Orange Revolution and resulted in the Supreme Court ordering a new election. This new election was won by Yushchenko, but he proved to be an ineffectual leader, spending most of his time cobbling together coalitions to keep himself in power on multiple occasions. The 2010 election saw Yanukovych finally win a close but reasonably fair election and he proceeded with more pro-Russian policies, including extending the lease to Russia on the critical port of Sevastopol in Crimea that is the home of Russia\u2019s Black Sea fleet. He also formally abandoned Ukraine\u2019s goal of joining NATO. In addition, Yanukovych orchestrated the imprisonment of his most important and mostly more pro-Western political rivals. With Yanukovych, it looked like Putin had his Ukrainian puppet without really firing a shot.\nThat all ended in late 2013 when, under enormous pressure from Putin, Yanukovych killed a planned agreement for Ukraine to increase its political and economic ties with the EU, originally negotiated under Yushchenko, just days before it was set to go in effect. That decision set off firestorm of protests across the country, even in Yanukovych\u2019s base in eastern Ukraine. Those protests and Yanukovych\u2019s attempts to crack down on them both escalated over the next few months, culminating in the massacre of dozens of protesters in Kyiv\u2019s Maidan square. At that point, Yanukovych\u2019s government essentially collapsed and, facing impeachment and probable prosecution for the massacres he ordered, he fled to Russia.\nAs Yanukovych\u2019s government was falling, Putin ensured that Russia would keep control the critical port of Sevastopol. Unidentified Russian troops essentially took over the Crimean government and installed a pro-Russian functionary who proposed a referendum on secession from Ukraine into Russia. Unsurprisingly, the fraudulent referendum, in which some cities like Sevastopol reported substantially more ballots than eligible voters, found that 97% of Crimeans wished to secede. Russia formally annexed Crimea and Russian troops took over the existing Ukrainian military facilities in the region. With Crimea now part of Russia, Putin abrogated the lease agreement with Ukraine for Sevastopol, which included a deal that allowed Ukraine to get Russian gas at discounted prices. Instead, Putin now raised those prices, increasing pressure on the new, interim Ukrainian government.\nHe increased that pressure just weeks later as, once again, approximately 40,000 unidentified Russian soldiers took over a number of eastern Ukrainian cities and installed separatist partisans who also scheduled a referendum on independence, which, unsurprisingly, was thoroughly fraudulent, with Ukrainian police uncovering around 100,000 ballots already pre-marked with a \u201cyes\u201d vote. All this happened within weeks of Yanukovych\u2019s ouster.\nLater in 2014, Petro Poroshenko, a more pro-Western reform-oriented oligarch, was elected President of Ukraine. For the next four years, a low-grade war continued in Ukraine\u2019s eastern regions, occasionally interrupted by short-lived cease-fires and failed agreements that were designed to lead to a real referendum on self-determination in those areas. During that time, the Ukrainian military occasionally made progress against the separatists who were increasingly being supported by more and more sophisticated Russian weaponry and even Russian forces. Poroshenko finally signed that economic agreement with the EU that Yanukovych had earlier scrapped and he began the formal process for Ukraine to withdraw from the Confederation of Independent States, the association of former Soviet republics that coordinated members\u2019 policies. But Poroshenko\u2019s term was again badly tarnished by corruption and a disgusted Ukrainian public, worn down by economic troubles and a seemingly never-ending conflict in the east, elected a true outsider, the popular comedian Volodymyr Zelensky, in a landslide in July 2019.\nIt\u2019s important to note that many saw Zelensky as a puppet for another Ukrainian oligarch, Ihor Kolomoisky, and his initial proposal for a peace agreement that would require both Ukrainian and Russian-backed insurgents to withdraw from the areas of conflict was also seen as a capitulation to Moscow that would legitimize the separatist control of those regions. His campaign statements about improving ties with Russia as well as his total lack of political experience also supported the idea that he could become an easily manipulated Putin appeaser. That is certainly how Donald Trump appeared to approach Zelensky when he demanded an investigation of Biden in return for the congressionally-approved military aid to Ukraine that Trump had withheld as part of his blackmail scheme. At the time of Zelensky\u2019s election, Putin had been meddling in Ukraine\u2019s internal politics for at least fifteen years, from Yushchenko\u2019s poisoning to the subversion in the Donbas, and had occupied parts of the country for five. And it now appeared that Zelensky would be willing to formalize Russian control of those occupied regions.\nThe patience Putin had shown in attempting to control Ukraine was also reflected in his attempts to sow divisions in the Western alliance. Beginning in 2009, in the aftermath of the financial crisis, Putin began financing far-right parties across Europe, helping to fuel opposition to both the EU and NATO. By the middle of the next decade, far-right parties in France, UK, Germany, Italy, Greece, Hungary, Poland, Bulgaria, Slovakia, Belgium, and Austria were all more or less ideologically aligned with Russia and many received direct financial assistance. In 2016, Putin saw his efforts come to fruition. In the UK, Russian propaganda and possible funding helped lead to Brexit and the country\u2019s departure from the European Union. Similar efforts in the US helped Trump win the presidency and a change to the Republican platform that restricted weapons sales to Ukraine in 2016. Current House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy\u2019s quip that Putin pays Trump did not come out of nowhere.\nBeyond the political meddling, Putin\u2019s oligarchs were also ingratiating themselves inside Western economies. The real estate markets in London and the US became fertile ground for Russians desperate to launder their ill-gotten gains. Western banks, including major firms like Deutsche Bank, UBS, and HSBC, were used to launder billions of dollars. Oligarchs like Roman Abramovich were reportedly sent to Europe by Putin to \u201cbuild a bulkhead of Russian influence\u201d by purchasing legendary soccer clubs. Other oligarchs ingratiated themselves to the West through philanthropy, promoting everything from the arts to gun rights. Most importantly, Europe\u2019s reliance on Russian gas and oil had made Putin economically indispensable to many countries in Europe, particularly Germany and Italy. Former German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder essentially became a lobbyist for Putin in Germany, obtaining board positions at NordStream, the natural gas pipeline to Europe owned by Gazprom, and Rosneft.\nSo, by the time Zelensky was elected in 2019, Putin probably could not have been more pleased about where he stood. Across Europe, there was significant support for parties that were aligned with Russian interests, although those parties might not have been quite as popular as in the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis. In Hungary and Serbia, there were openly pro-Russian governments, with Hungary able to sabotage the EU from within. Britian had been peeled away from the EU. He was so confident about his position with respect to Britain that he could act with impunity by assassinating a number of opponents inside the UK without significant repercussions. And in the US, Trump was leading an American retreat from its traditional allies, negotiating a withdrawal from Afghanistan with the Taliban, was preparing to pull thousands of troops out of Europe, and looked likely to pull the US out of NATO should he win a second term, a likely scenario given America\u2019s history of two-term presidents. For Putin, looking at a seemingly pliable Zelensky and an imminent collapse of NATO, it seemed possible that he could absorb Ukraine back into Russia without firing an additional shot.\nThat rosy scenario had become out of the question by the start of 2021. Zelensky was a far stronger leader than had been anticipated and there was really no progress in resolving the conflict in eastern Ukraine. Trump had lost the election and Biden\u2019s team was making a strong effort to rebuild its alliances and shore up NATO, even as it completed the withdrawal from Afghanistan that Trump had negotiated. We may never know why Putin attacked Ukraine in 2022, whether because he saw his prior advantage slipping away or his own personal health issues or something else entirely.\nThe invasion, however, has proven to be one of the most disastrous miscalculations in recent history. NATO is galvanized. Sweden and Finland are set to join NATO. Germany is ramping up its defense budget. Theoretically pro-Russian neighboring republics like Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan are refusing to directly support Putin\u2019s war. While Russia does use Belarus as a staging ground for the attacks on Ukraine, the Belarusian army has so far remained out of the conflict and there have been reports of Belarusians sabotaging Russian efforts. Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan have even sent humanitarian aid to Ukraine. The Russian economy is predicted to shrink by over 10% despite increased receipts due to the higher prices of gas and oil. And Putin has lost about one quarter of his combat-ready battalion tactical groups in addition to an enormous amount of military hardware. None of this is likely to deter Putin from his goal of absorbing Ukraine into Russia and it seems likely that it will actually make him more ruthless and determined to do so in order to make it seem \u201cworth it\u201d. He has suppressed the internal dissent, even that from within his own state apparatus, which was seen at the beginning of the war and his propaganda machine has rallied the Russian people behind him.\nMore importantly for Putin, Ukraine\u2019s continued existence will rely on support from the West, both militarily and economically, for the foreseeable future. Putin can take whatever he can get from the renewed offensive in eastern Ukraine and simply wait for the West to lose focus. Indeed, Putin may also see his prior efforts to sabotage the West from within soon bear fruit again. Hungary has already defied the EU by agreeing to pay for Russian gas in rubles rather than euros. While not economically significant, it does illustrate the disruptive power Hungary has in a consensus-requiring organization like the EU. In France, Marine Le Pen, a xenophobic, racist nationalist whose prior campaigns actually received Russian funding, has advanced to the run-off for the French presidency against current President Macron in an election to be held in just two weeks. Le Pen wants to pull France out of NATO and has, in the past, proposed withdrawing from the EU as well. For this campaign, she has toned down any EU withdrawal to simply reducing France\u2019s funding for the organization and restricting the freedom of movement within the EU, which, combined, would resemble a near total EU withdrawal. A Le Pen victory would put the existence of both NATO and the EU at risk and would provide a critical blow to both organizations\u2019 support for Ukraine.\nLater this fall, midterm elections in the US are expected to result in Republicans taking over both houses of Congress. It is possible that a new Republican Congress could severely crimp Biden\u2019s ability to support Ukraine in much the same way Democrats restricted the Reagan administration in Central America with the Boland Amendment. Just the other day, over 60 Republican House members, almost one third of the GOP House conference, voted against a resolution supporting NATO. Last month, 31 GOP Senators voted against an overall spending bill that included nearly $14 billion for Ukraine. The GOP\u2019s emergent far-right has largely backed Putin, either through direct support and praise or by blaming the West for Putin\u2019s invasion. In May, CPAC, the annual gathering of increasingly crazy conservatives, is planning to hold its next conference in Hungary with the pro-Putin autocrat Viktor Orban as a prime speaker.\nWithin the next six months, therefore, there will be two elections that could dramatically change the direction of the war in his favor. Then, of course, there is the US presidential election in 2024. Trump is still the odds-on favorite to win the GOP nomination, has consistently supported Putin against Ukraine, still disparages NATO, and gives every indication he will withdraw from NATO if he wins the presidency again. You can be sure Russian attempts to interfere on Trump\u2019s behalf in 2024 will surpass all that they have done before.\nPutin\u2019s war in Ukraine has been a disaster. But Putin has been working on bringing Ukraine back into the Russian fold for two decades. He shown patience in achieving that goal. However, it seems increasingly clear that he can not win this war on the ground without turning all of Ukraine into Grozny as long as Western support for Ukraine remains firm. Even then, he would be facing a multi-year guerilla war a la Afghanistan. It now appears Putin\u2019s best chance for winning lies in sabotaging the West\u2019s will from within. The next few years will provide the test of whether the West can stand firm against its pro-Putin fifth columnists and outlast Putin\u2019s patience.\nOriginally published at https://thesoundings.com on April 13, 2022.", "comment_count": 5, "like_count": 101, "created_time": 1649863706716, "comment": [{"user_id": "52a5f989cdbb", "comment_time": 1649863706716, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "1a1227e369d", "comment_time": 1649966226315, "comment": "An excellent analysis of recent history.

If a body is immersed in a fluid, it will experience an upward force proportional to the weight of the fluid it displaces. If a White woman gets into a verbal altercation with a person of color, she\u2019ll be doxxed, vilified, and fired from her job.\nThat last one is a bit of a mixed bag.\nOn the one hand, there are people like Amy Cooper, who was fired last year after her infamous attempt to commit homicide-by-cop. Or Sonya Holt who lost her job for screaming racist and homophobic slurs at protesters during a Black Lives Matter Rally. There\u2019s Hilary Mueller, who attained involuntarily unemployment when she tried to prevent a Black neighbor from entering his apartment building. And Jacqueline DeLuca, who, after seeing a Black man run a stoplight, posted a Facebook rant suggesting that somebody should \u201ckill \u2019em all.\u201d\nBut there are also people like children\u2019s author Jessica Cluess, who was dropped by her agent after a heated (but not even slightly racist) quarrel with a Black writer. And Dominique Moran, who was fired for asking a group of Black men\u2014who had bragged about repeatedly \u201cdining and dashing\u201d at her restaurant\u2014to pay in advance.\nMost recently, there\u2019s Emma Sarley, who lost her job last week following a confrontation with Frederick Joseph and his fianc\u00e9 at a local dog park. Sarley approached the couple, whose dog she claims had been behaving aggressively, and in the ensuing argument, she suggested that they \u201cstay in their hood.\u201d\nIn response, Joseph uploaded a brief video of Sarley to Twitter, publicly revealed her name and social media accounts to his more than 116,000 followers, and tweeted her employer with the express intention of getting her fired.\nThis, he wrote, was \u201ca lesson in accountability and consequences.\"\nBut what exactly is the lesson here? That a confrontation between a Black person and a White person, however benign, should always be viewed as \u201ca racist attack\u201d? That Black people can only gain the upper hand against White people if we portray ourselves as brittle, vindictive crybabies? That Black skin is so tissue-paper thin that if you hurt our feelings, we\u2019re justified in spending the next few hours trying to ruin your life?\nIn the immortal words of Bill Maher, why do we allow the people who just want to bitch to always win?\nIt\u2019s worth asking why we\u2019re even hearing about this. How did this trivial, non-violent dispute become international news? Why did Sarley lose her job over the kind of dumb, meaningless argument that everybody, no matter the color of their skin, has experienced?\nAnd the answer (beyond the fact that race-baiting is big business) is that a disturbing number of people have bought into the idea that White people hold some immutable power over Black people.\nDon\u2019t believe me? Consider Derek Anderson\u2019s (Sarley\u2019s now-former boss) reaction to Joseph\u2019s story:\nSpoke with [Frederick Joseph] about his and his fianc\u00e9\u2019s horrific experience from last night. So sorry to them for what has happened. No one should treat people the way we witnessed. This is extremely troubling.\nNo, you\u2019re not missing anything. The \u201chorrific experience\u201d in question was a White woman telling a Black man twice her size to \u201cstay in his hood.\u201d\nIf we allow Black people to claim victimhood whenever it\u2019s convenient, we affirm the racists who think we\u2019re too \u201cweak, sensitive and fragile\u201d to deserve respect.\nDoes anybody think Anderson would\u2019ve put it this way if a Black woman had said the same thing to a Black man? Or better yet, if a Black woman had said it to a White man? Was \u201chood\u201d added to the list of words that only Black people can say while I wasn\u2019t paying attention? Does nobody else see that normalizing this level of fragility is incredibly condescending?\nTell me Joseph flew into a rage because she called him a ni**er, and even though I\u2019d disagree, I could at least understand. Tell me he went after her so aggressively because she posed a threat to his safety, and I\u2019d be able to get on board. But tell me he \u201cexperienced trauma\u201d because he was told to \u201cstay in his hood\u201d (not even to stay in the hood mind you), and I\u2019m calling bulls**t.\nSo should everyone who doesn\u2019t secretly believe Black people are weaklings.\nSome of you are already heading to the comments to lecture me about historical context and racial hierarchies. And yes, there are many ways in which Black people, as a demographic, are disadvantaged.\nBut we don\u2019t need to look very far to see this isn\u2019t true at the individual level.\nAfter all, it\u2019s hard to argue that Joseph was at a disadvantage as he chased Sarley down the street with his camera. It\u2019s hard to believe that he wanted accountability when the punishment he sought so far outweighed the \u201ccrime.\u201d It\u2019s hard to pretend that he\u2019s powerless when he was able to get her fired simply by sending a few tweets.\nWe\u2019re encouraged to overlook all of this because uncritically defending \u201cmarginalized people\u201d is the \u201cwoke\u201d thing to do. We\u2019re supposed to ignore the power that Joseph\u2019s \u201cvictimhood\u201d afforded him because we\u2019ve been taught to boil people down to labels like \u201coppressor\u201d and \u201coppressed.\u201d And we\u2019re meant to excuse the fact that he abused that power because a White woman hurt his feelings.\nBut this is not, nor will it ever be, a path to equality.\nIf we don\u2019t challenge the people who portray Black people as weaklings, we can\u2019t be surprised when Black children learn to think of themselves that way. If we allow Black people to claim victimhood whenever it\u2019s convenient, we affirm the racists who think we\u2019re too \u201cweak, sensitive and fragile\u201d to deserve respect. If we don\u2019t hold ourselves to the same standards as everybody else, we can\u2019t expect to be treated like everybody else.\nWe can demand special treatment, or we can demand equality, but we can\u2019t demand both. That, too, is a universal law.\nIntroducing The Commentary. A selection of beautiful, brilliant, and bizarre conversations about race, politics, and culture.

It conveys more information, more quickly, than almost any other type of emotion.\nAnd he\u2019s not wrong.\nProperly harnessed, anger allows us to say things we might not otherwise have dared. It encourages honesty, even if we don\u2019t always express ourselves perfectly. It forces us to do something about circumstances we\u2019ve tolerated for too long.\nThere\u2019s just one problem; anger is hard to sustain. Most of us are mature enough that our anger will eventually give way to reason. But anger needs constant justification. It needs an antagonist. It needs fuel. And in 2022, we\u2019ve found a seemingly limitless supply.\nIf anger is like a drug, the news is the perfect dealer; available 24/7, 100% legal, and always ready to give you a hit of the good stuff. Best of all, it\u2019s free!\nWant a hit of misguided rage? Here\u2019s a stunning blend of incompetent reporting, false equivalence, and race-baiting. I call it the Rittenhouse Special.\nDo you need a target for that nagging sense of inadequacy? Here\u2019s a heady mixture of racism, conspiracy theories, and brainwashing. It\u2019s called Donald Trump\u2019s Big High (careful with this one though, the comedown is harsh).\nMaybe you prefer a steady, low-level pique? In that case, you\u2019ll love the Pandemic Haze. It\u2019s one of the most enduring fusions of incompetence, misinformation, and selfishness the world has ever seen. The great thing about this one is you\u2019ll be furious whichever side of the debate you\u2019re on!\nAnd in the unlikely event that there\u2019s nothing infuriating happening right at this moment, don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll stir something up!\nHow about we take a bill that doesn\u2019t mention homosexuality at any point, call it the \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay\u201d bill, and claim that it \u201c[bans] discussion of LGBTQ issues\"? Or a series of bills that have nothing to do with Critical Race Theory (CRT), and call them \u201canti-CRT\u201d bills? What if we take a nuanced, compassionate essay and describe it as a \u201ctransphobic manifesto\"?\nAre we even attempting to portray these things accurately? Is it remotely likely they\u2019ll lead to the outcomes we\u2019re scaring you with? Who cares?! You\u2019ll be so busy fighting about 1619 and chromosomes and whether 9-year-olds should be taking classes on sexuality, we\u2019re betting you won\u2019t even read them.\nIf you\u2019ve been feeling as if the internet is getting angrier lately, you\u2019re not alone. But it\u2019s not an accident, it\u2019s a revenue model. Our discourse is being corrupted by professional s**t-stirrers, whose job is to stoke our outrage to keep the lights on.\nCompanies compete for our attention by feeding us the most divisive, incendiary content their algorithms can provide. Pundits catastrophise and exaggerate until the stakes for every disagreement feel like the collapse of civilisation. And all of this has made us so unreasonable that wishing strangers dead on social media has become code for \u201cI disagree. \u201c\nBut what if there\u2019s a difference between a challenge to our ideas and an attack on everything we hold dear? What if everybody to our political left or right isn\u2019t a bigot or a moron or an irredeemable monster? What if we should be worried if a difference of opinion can send us flying into a rage?\nThe greatest allure of being angry is that, at least in the moment, it\u2019s indistinguishable from being right. It feels as if there\u2019s only one way to see the situation, and it\u2019s ours. It feels as if anyone who disagrees with us is not merely wrong, but immoral. It allows us to convince ourselves that yelling at strangers on the internet is activism.\nBut anger is a starting point, not a destination. If we want to make progress, we need to think. We need to learn how to hold our strong opinions weakly. We need to look at the world from perspectives other than our own. We need to make room for the possibility that we might be the ones who are missing something.\nAnger is like a drug. But that can be a positive thing. It\u2019s powerful, it\u2019s motivating, it\u2019s useful. As long as you don\u2019t get hooked.\nIntroducing The Commentary.

This last, seemingly innocuous question has become a political landmine in recent years.\nKetanji Brown-Jackson claimed she didn\u2019t know the answer at her Supreme Court nomination hearing last week (despite using the mysterious terminology numerous times during the proceedings).\nA few weeks earlier, on International Women\u2019s Day no less, Anneliese Dodds, Shadow Minister for Women and Equalities in the UK, got so confused that she lost track of what the words \u201cadult\u201d and \u201cfemale\u201d mean.\nAnd Yvette Cooper, the Shadow Home Secretary, refused to even try, describing the question as a \u201crabbit hole.\"\nThe question of what a woman is has become so contentious, that some people on Twitter have grown suspicious:\n\u201cEver notice how these transphobes only ask people to define \u201cwoman?\"\nAnd it\u2019s true! For some reason, the debate around trans rights is almost entirely focused on these mysterious \u201cwomen.\u201d\nBut what could explain this?\nIs there any data to suggest that they\u2019re at dramatically higher risk of sexual violence? Or that men are overwhelmingly more likely to be the perpetrators of that violence? Is it possible that the entire reason for sex-based segregation is that males are typically stronger and more sexually predatory than females?\nBut if that were the case, why wouldn\u2019t they just let in the men who don\u2019t pose a threat to women? I mean, they don\u2019t even allow gay men into female-only spaces (and strangely enough, we don\u2019t claim that\u2019s homophobic)!\nCould it be that just as there\u2019s no way to tell at a glance whether a man is gay or straight, there\u2019s no way to tell at a glance whether a man truly identifies as a woman or is faking. Or whether he is or is not a rapist.\nCould it be that when you think about it that way, it\u2019s not entirely unreasonable to want to preserve rules that protect female spaces from males? That maybe these hateful bigots are genuinely worried about women\u2019s rights and safety and don\u2019t hate trans people at all?\nNah\u2026couldn\u2019t be.\nA further consequence of the uncertainty about the word \u201cwoman\u201d is that several organisations have simply dropped it in favour of other, more \u201cinclusive\u201d terms like \u201cmenstruator\" and \u201cbirthing people\u201d (the extra syllable in genuinely inclusive language like \u201cwomen and trans men\u201d is, apparently, a bridge too far).\nAnd this has led some people to claim that the word \u201cwoman\u201d is being \u201cerased or has become \u201ctaboo.\u201d\nBut this couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. There are still plenty of contexts where it\u2019s not only acceptable, but progressive, to use the word \u201cwoman.\u201d\nFor example, when describing somebody who has been accused of \u201cexposing [their] penis [\u2026] and masturbating in public,\u201d be sure to refer to her as a woman, as these headlines do. But if you\u2019re referencing an iconic quote about women\u2019s rights from Ruth Bader Ginsburg, you should follow the ACLU\u2019s lead and strip all mention of the word \u201cwoman\u201d from it first.\nLia Thomas is the NCAA Division 1 Women\u2019s champion, having transitioned from being the #462 ranked swimmer amongst males to the #1 ranked swimmer amongst females. But any woman with the temerity to ask whether this is fair should be labelled a transphobe or a TERF or a variety of other terms that I won\u2019t repeat here...\nRachel Levine is properly referred to as one of USA Today\u2019s Women of the Year. But Adele is best described as this year\u2019s Brit Artist of the Year because the award ceremony is now gender-neutral.\nAnd if any of this strikes you as dehumanising or misogynistic or downright Orwellian, well, just remind yourself that you\u2019re not a biologist. I mean, it\u2019s not as if any of us can say what a lioness or a doe or a vixen or a hen or a mare or a tigress or a queen bee is. Why should humans be the only species whose females have a name?\nI\u2019ve resigned myself to the fact that I\u2019ll be branded a transphobe or a TERF by some of the people reading this. And even though I don\u2019t identify as either, that\u2019s fine.\nBecause I\u2019m clearly missing something.\nSo I\u2019m asking, in all sincerity; why can\u2019t trans women be trans women? Why can\u2019t trans men be trans men? Why is it hateful to admit that the \u201ctrans\u201d in these identities means something?\nWho suffers if we celebrate Rachel Levine as USA Today\u2019s Trans Woman of the Year? Or recognise Lia Thomas as the fastest trans woman swimmer in the NCAA? How is it that cultures that have recognised gender diversity for thousands of years, like the Muxe in Mexico, the kha\u2019-nun-tha\u2019 triad of the Arabian peninsula, and the various \u201cgender non-conforming\u201d identities of \u201ctwo-spirit\u201d people, acknowledge that their identities are distinct from \u201cman\u201d and \u201cwoman\u201d without feeling invalidated?\nBecause beyond the bickering over whether trans women are women or trans men are men, or what a woman is, lies the undeniable fact that trans rights are human rights.\nHow do we safeguard trans people\u2019s right to safe, effective healthcare? How do we overcome the employment and housing discrimination that trans people face? How do we ensure that trans people, that all people, are free to live authentically without fear of violence or abuse?\nThese are the questions we should be grappling with. These are the questions that we should be demanding that our leaders answer. These are the questions that will materially improve the quality of trans lives.\nAnd best of all, we can all agree on what the words in them mean.\nIntroducing The Commentary.

So I\u2019ll just put it this way:\nIf I\u2019d had an older brother when I was growing up, Will Smith would have ruined his life.\nEvery morning, as we brushed our teeth, I\u2019d have pointed out that no matter how diligently he flossed, his smile would never be quite as dazzling as Will Smith\u2019s was when he met Eva Mendes in Hitch.\nIf his grades faltered, I\u2019d have reminded him that in the Pursuit of Happyness, Will Smith completes a fiercely competitive, unpaid internship whilst homeless, studying for (and acing) the stockbroker\u2019s exam, and single-handedly caring for his five-year-old son. He also teaches himself how to solve a Rubik\u2019s cube.\nAs he prepared to make his way in the world, I\u2019d have whispered in his ear that DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince released their Grammy award-winning hit \u201cSummertime\u201d when Smith was just 22 years old. The same year he won his iconic role as the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.\nAnd as he grappled with crippling self-doubt, I\u2019d have sympathised, of course.\nBut not nearly as profoundly as I did with Will Smith\u2019s character in Seven Pounds.\nAs you\u2019re no doubt aware, Will Smith and Chris Rock are a couple of guys who\u2019ve been up to no good.\nChris made a joke about Jada Pinkett Smith\u2019s shaved head (the result of her ongoing battle with alopecia) while presenting the Academy Awards. And in response, Will got up on stage, slapped Chris in the face on live television, and yelled at him to \u201ckeep my wife\u2019s name out your f**king mouth.\u201d\nThen he won an Oscar.\nThere\u2019s no shortage of people claiming that comedy is under attack, but I don\u2019t think any other celebrity has taken it quite so literally. And as I was trying to make sense of it, I was struck by this quote from CNN\u2019s post-mortem of events:\nThe comediennes who were there were taking digs at Hollywood. And why do they do that? Because these are people that have power, they\u2019ve got money, they\u2019ve got all the things they need to exist and be comfortable in this world. And this is a moment where you make people uncomfortable.\n\u201cThis is a moment where you make people uncomfortable.\u201d\nReally? I mean, there have been some high profile cases of comedians making people uncomfortable lately, but does anybody fail to see the difference between poking fun at a range of demographics, and targeting a specific individual? Is there any justification for making Jada Pinkett Smith, in particular, \u201cuncomfortable\u201d, other than \u201cthis person is richer and/or better looking than I am.\u201d\nIs there a point, such as when Laverne Cox made the latest of countless quips about Jada\u2019s \u201centanglements\", whilst interviewing Will and Jada in February, or Rebel Wilson\u2019s joke that Will\u2019s best performance over the past year was \u201cbeing okay with all his wife\u2019s boyfriends,\u201d where good-natured teasing turns into something else?\nAre there lines of privacy and decency that we shouldn\u2019t cross, even when dealing with someone who has \u201call the things they need to be comfortable in the world\u201d? Should we be using award ceremonies as an excuse to treat meanness as entertainment? If you repeatedly make fun of somebody\u2019s marital or health issues right in front of them and they get mad, is it, perhaps, a little bit your fault?\nI\u2019m conscious as I write this that there are more pressing matters in the world than one millionaire smacking another millionaire in the mouth. But in the end, this story isn\u2019t about celebrities, it\u2019s about how we treat each other.\nThere\u2019s been a gradual embrace of the idea that anybody more \u201cpowerful\u201d than we are is fair game. That meanness only ever flows in one direction. That every interaction has a blameless victim and clear-cut oppressor.\nBut this is hopelessly simplistic.\nWill Smith shouldn\u2019t have hit Chris Rock. In fact, my first thought when he did it was that it must be a joke. He has every right to be angry at the way his personal life has been paraded by the media and no right whatsoever to assault anybody for it.\nChris Rock shouldn\u2019t have made fun of Jada Pinkett Smith\u2019s medical condition. Especially given that his 2009 documentary, Good Hair, was inspired by his three-year-old daughter\u2019s insecurities about her hair.\nNone of us should be normalising the idea that it\u2019s okay to be cruel to people if they\u2019re richer and more successful than we are.\nAll of these are true at the same time.\nNobody should forfeit their humanity once their bank balance hits some unspecified number of zeroes. Fame doesn\u2019t protect people from the insecurities and vulnerabilities that we all feel.\nHumour is always going to be subjective. It\u2019s fine if a joke doesn\u2019t land as expected from time to time. But personal attacks? Physical or otherwise? That\u2019s just not cool.\nIntroducing The Commentary.

The world needs quiet people. Why?\nQuiet people make you think.\nThinking brings clarity.\nThinking can lead to change.\nI\u2019ve always been intrigued by Keanu. He is a quiet person who keeps to himself and still hasn\u2019t figured out how to be famous after twenty-nine years of being one of the most iconic Hollywood Actors of all time.\nKeanu doesn\u2019t get fame, attention or noise. Instead, he prefers to be quiet and insert silence in his speeches and TV interviews.\nWhen he does choose to speak, he drops short sentence bombs like this interview with Steven Colbert:\nStephen: \u201cWhat do you think happens when we die, Keanu Reeves?\u201d\nKeanu: I know that the ones who love us will miss us.\nIn eleven words, Keanu summed up the entire meaning of life. It was a moment of sheer brilliance.\nTake Time to Answer a Question\nIn a relatively unknown interview with Keanu back in 2000, RollingStone writer, Chris Heath, picks up on how Keanu uses silence.\nI ask him why he acts. For forty-two seconds, he says nothing. Not a word, a grunt, a prevarication, or a hint that an answer might come. For most of that time, his head is angled at ninety degrees away from me, as if that\u2019s where the oxygen is.\n\u201cUh,\u201d he finally says, \u201cthe words that popped into my head were expression and, uh, it\u2019s fun.\u201d A few minutes later, I lob a vague question about whether he ever wants to write or direct. He lets out a kind of quiet sigh.\nAt its worst, it\u2019s like this. You ask Keanu Reeves a question and . . . just wait. Out in space, planets collide, stars go supernova. On earth, forests fall, animals screech and roar. People shout and rant and weep with anger and joy and just for the hell of it.\nAnd, all this time, Reeves sits there, entirely silent.\nOn this particular occasion, the silence lasts seventy-two seconds.\nRather than answering a question, Keanu waits to see if he has an answer worth giving. He then attempts to edit down his response in his head so that it can be understood. Many of the interviews with Keanu contain huge chunks of silence. That\u2019s why his TV interviews aren\u2019t that in-depth because it takes him time to respond and a three-minute TV interview just doesn\u2019t do it.\nThe real answers to life\u2019s toughest questions take time to answer.\nSoftly Spoken Brings People Closer\nBillie Eilish does this with her music. Many of her songs contain lyrics that are softly sung and you have to lean in to understand what she\u2019s saying.\nKeanu uses softly spoken words in interviews to bring people in and take them on a journey. Hollywood wants him to be loud and fancy, but that\u2019s not how he rolls, and he\u2019s intentional about it.\nWe\u2019re told to be loud. Social media teaches us to use caps, emojis, hashtags and big, bold captions on our videos to get people to listen.\nWhat if doing the opposite of loud was really the answer to being heard?\nA soft voice like Keanu\u2019s draws you in, and then, only then, can you hear what he is trying to say.\nOne-liners that Break the Room\nJournalist, Miki Turner, shares this thought about Keanu in her story titled \u201cKeanu is a man of a few soft-spoken words.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not that Reeves is difficult because sometimes he\u2019ll go completely left and deliver a one-liner that will break up the room \u2014 like when a reporter asked Reeves if he felt his career was being defined by his \u201cMatrix\u201d experience.\n\u201cI am the ambassador for the \u2018Matrix\u2019 trilogy,\u201d Reeves said in a deep, robot-like voice. \u201cMy operating hours are\u2026\u201d\nWhen you speak less and sit back and listen, during the rare times when you do talk, you have the space to deliver one-liners like Keanu that blow people\u2019s minds and help them to think deeply.\nSilence Breeds Curiosity\nKeanu uses silence brilliantly in speeches and public performances. The silence helps the listener become curious about what he\u2019s going to say. It breeds suspense and that helps you put your phone away and listen.\nSilence breeds curiosity and curiosity leads to a conversation where someone will listen to you.\nBeing Quiet Interrupts the Pattern\nHollywood actors are typically loud and have large personalities. By being quiet like Keanu, you interrupt people\u2019s thought patterns.\nTry this: attend a work meeting that you\u2019re supposed to be contributing to. Say nothing. Sit there and actively listen with an engaged look on your face. Continue to be quiet and resist the urge to fill up time with your voice. Watch what happens. At some point, your silence is going to break the pattern of the meeting. Somebody is going to ask you for your point of view and it\u2019s during that moment that you will be \u201cproperly\u201d heard.\nThe typical pattern of meetings and human conversation is to talk a lot. Try being quiet to break the pattern and help people think with your words.\nPeople can\u2019t resist the urge to talk \u2014 they also can\u2019t resist the urge to hear from the people who are extremely quiet.\nPauses Allow Time for Reflection\nThe quiet ones like Keanu always seem to use strategic pauses.\nBetween each point they\u2019re trying to make, they add a pause. When giving a compliment or expressing gratitude, they add a pause to ensure the maximum effect is felt by those listening.\nPauses in human dialogue allow our minds to think at a deeper level.\nThe challenge is often we um and ah our way through pauses rather than intentionally leaving a few.\nA pause is a tool you can use to get people to think.\nThe Smarter you Become, the Less You Speak\nThis is the key lesson Keanu has taught me: You\u2019re not smart by talking a lot. You\u2019re not having an impact by increasing your speech volume or trying to be important. You\u2019re smart when you do the following:\nLet people talk first\nListen with intention\nWhen your face shows you\u2019re engaged in the conversation\nYou practice saying less\nYou lead with empathy\nQuiet People Make us Think\nSilence is not only golden; it makes you think. And we need more time to think during these uncertain times.\nConversely, you can\u2019t think about what someone is saying if you\u2019re lost in thoughts of what you\u2019re going to say next.\nIt\u2019s okay to be quiet so you can think.\nQuiet people change the world.\nJoin my email list to stay in touch.", "comment_count": 308, "like_count": 55328, "created_time": 1590981594883, "comment": [{"user_id": "b6d641be1066", "comment_time": 1590981594883, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "a659c3c2518a", "comment_time": 1591195654976, "comment": "Fantastic article.

They don\u2019t say it. But they bloody well think it. As a kid, one of the first Nintendo games I played was called Pilotwings 64.\nIt was harder than any other game. You had to fly various vehicles over islands, do maneuvers, and then land your aircraft. Hundreds of attempts were required to have any chance of getting to the next level in the game.\nMost quit too soon and went to play Mario64. They preferred a fake plumber character with a bad Italian accent that had to collect coins and occasionally stomp on a piranha.\nI chose hard.\nStrangely, choosing hard was a tough pill to swallow. Later, I learned that hard is the way. If you want the good life you have to choose hard more than easy. Society mostly chooses easy. Then they wonder why life sucks.\nBehind mountains are more mountains \u2014 Haitian proverb\nHere are some more hard pills to swallow.\nRejection means your pitch sucked\nNo response is a response.\nWhen rejection happens it\u2019s easy to blame the source. It\u2019s easy to call it discrimination or to believe it\u2019s foul play. You think you\u2019re ready or it\u2019s your time or you deserve it.\nMaybe. Maybe not.\nA different way of thinking\nMost rejection happens because \u2018the ask\u2019 sucks.\nLearn to ask better questions. Build up a portfolio of work that acts as proof of work. Don\u2019t take rejections seriously.\nThe first answer will almost always be a no, or zero response. It\u2019s the third, fourth, and tenth \u2018asks\u2019 that hold all the power.\nRejection is redirection. Rejection means ask differently, too.\nDreams are useless\nVision boards need to be lit on fire.\nThey encourage us to dream rather than execute. Most dreams never happen because daily action isn\u2019t common. Anyone can have a fantasy. Anyone can get the juices in their loins overflowing.\nWhat\u2019s hard is to live the dream.\nA different way of thinking\nCreate 15-minute habits that are so small you won\u2019t forget them. Build on the 15 minutes as you get back-to-back winning streaks.\nHabits turn fantasies into reality.\nHurt people, hurt people\nIf you do anything more than going to a job and collecting an entry-level paycheck, you\u2019ll face resistance.\nStrangers, colleagues, and family you love will try to hurt you. It won\u2019t make any sense. It\u2019ll keep you awake at night.\nLots of people are deeply hurt. They refuse to face their pain. So they walk around hurt, looking for more people to hurt.\nHurting you distracts them from their nightmare. They feel less alone when they blame, complain, and attack innocents.\nA different way of thinking\nSee hurt people for what they are. Don\u2019t let their hurt become your hurt. You can simply try to get them help or walk away if they\u2019re too hard to fix.\nIt\u2019s never the right time to do anything\nGoals are nice.\nI know plenty of people online who have the goal to write for a living. They\u2019ve thought about it for years. The act of sitting down to write looks enormous in their head.\nThe idea of what it\u2019ll take to write is so big they wait for a period in their life when they\u2019ll have more time to deal with it.\nA common time is the holidays. With no job to go to, they foolishly tell themselves this is it. Then procrastination sets in. They take another course or read another book, waiting to get ready for their big moment.\nThe holidays are over. They lie to themselves and think they have made progress.\n\u201cBit by bit\u201d they say.\nThey wait for the next holidays. This pattern repeats for years. They never manage to write for a living.\nA different way of thinking\nThere\u2019s no good time to work on what you love.\nYou make time.\nYou force tasks into your calendar, hell or high water. You guard certain parts of your calendar with your life.\nIf it\u2019s non-negotiable, it\u2019s a priority. If it\u2019s flexible, it\u2019s a waste of your life.\nYou won\u2019t get rich quick\nThe common thoughts about money are delusional. It\u2019s what I call \u201clottery thinking\u201d \u2014 the idea a random event will flush your bank account with all the riches one could want. Silly.\nWealthy people make a lot of money, slowly.\nIf a lot of money can be made fast, chances are it\u2019s a con. Don\u2019t be a sucker. See the risks in every financial decision. Use research to get a financial advantage.\nDon\u2019t trust some dumb influencer, or a Youtuber using fearbait to get views and monetize your attention.\nA different way of thinking\nTake it slow with investing money. Slow is fast.\nFailure is future success\nCollege teaches us to get good grades and avoid failure. My wife is from an Asian country with a red flag and yellow stars.\nThey\u2019re taught to get all the answers right. Perfection is what they strive for. Not having an answer to a problem is seen as weak, especially if in public or put on the spot at work.\nWhen a culture built on this lie faces guaranteed failure in life, they buckle under pressure. They can\u2019t handle it.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with me?\u201d they say.\nA different way of thinking\nI got taught by various mentors to lean into failure.\nFailure means you\u2019re making progress.\nYou\u2019re putting yourself on the line and standing on the battlefield of life. You\u2019re not sitting on the sidelines, playing it small, hoping for everything to always work in your favor.\nLife doesn\u2019t work that way.\nDoesn\u2019t mean you fail on purpose like a dumbass. But when you\u2019ve done your best and failed, it\u2019s highly likely it\u2019ll lead to future success.\nCollege teaches us failure lessons from others that we think we can avoid. So we don\u2019t properly learn them. Failure we experience teaches us lessons we learn \u2014 and will never forget.\nDoing the right thing is the hardest thing\nMany of the people you idolize broke the rules.\nThey cheated the system. They had an unknown advantage. They mistold the real story. Look at Hollywood. Dumpster fire.\nTake success stories lightly.\nThe hard part is to do the right thing every day.\nTo not break the rules\nTo be honest with everyone\nTo be kind\nTo get less upside than the other person in a deal\nTo take the slow path\nWe know doing the right thing is always the right thing. Yet we easily forget it when there\u2019s a chance to leap ahead in the game of life.\nA different way of thinking\nChoose the honest way even if it costs you a lot.\nDon\u2019t be tempted to do the wrong thing, because you\u2019re only stealing from your future self. Those who cheat can\u2019t cheat forever. One day their streak of good luck runs out and then none of it is worth it.\nDoing the right thing builds your karma bank account. Good karma can pay all the bills for the rest of your life if you\u2019ll only let it.\nMaybe you\u2019re deeply wrong\nToo many people won\u2019t admit it when they discover they\u2019re wrong. To be wrong is seen as a sign of weakness.\nNot admitting you\u2019re wrong makes you part of your own cult.\nA different way of thinking\nBeing wrong means you learned a lesson. It\u2019s a form of humility few people have. Question your assumptions and let it positively build on your beliefs.\nNo one cares if you aren\u2019t \u201cequal\u201d\nWTF is equal anyway?\nThe quest to make things fair is a disaster. Life will never be fair. There will always be haves and have-nots.\nTrue equality is a fantasy, and I\u2019m not proud to say it.\nA different way of thinking\nThe truth is no one cares if you\u2019re equal or you got your fair share. Nope. They just care about getting theirs.\nPoliticians, both government and corporate, tell you what you want to hear. They\u2019re not in the business of fairness. They\u2019re in the business of getting elected to the position of status/power again for as long as possible.\nThings will never be equal. Even the score by doing what is hard.\nNobody is coming to save you\nNo piece of legislation will save you from ruin.\nNo new job will suddenly come from LinkedIn and make your career amazing. No former boss or friendly colleague will gift you a great career either.\nNo life coach will magically enter your life and cast a spell on you that transforms your existence. These are lies. Harsh but true.\nA different way of thinking\nWe save ourselves. Read that again.\nConversations are taken for granted\nAn amazing man named Ted Rheingold died of cancer a few years ago. He was lost too soon. Many of you reading this knew him.\nTed said, \u201cIf you think a conversation with someone may be the last, you explore it with a force that redefines what a normal trivial conversation means.\u201d\nEvery day you\u2019re talking to people. You never know if any one of those conversations will be the last with that person.\nPretend it is.\nConversations will start to look different. You\u2019ll communicate with a level of emotion and vulnerability that\u2019ll make you appear superhuman to those trapped in their own Matrix.\nToo many of you act like you live twice. Anthony Pompliano says you start living the day you understand you\u2019re going to die. It could be at any moment.\nNow that\u2019s a hard pill to swallow that\u2019ll change your life.\nJoin my email list with 50K+ people for more helpful insights.", "comment_count": 7, "like_count": 684, "created_time": 1649639311469, "comment": [{"user_id": "b6d641be1066", "comment_time": 1649639311469, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "ecae52b307de", "comment_time": 1650023519472, "comment": "2 of my favorite mantras:"}, {"user_id": "5be42de916ae", "comment_time": 1650019167646, "comment": "projection is the tragic but most little known way of how toxics sobotage talented people pleasers.... see it in the workworld but especially among family and friends...."}, {"user_id": "13cdef95fdcc", "comment_time": 1650030926242, "comment": "bravo nice one Tim"}, {"user_id": "7252b1104bfb", "comment_time": 1650012905407, "comment": "Thanks Tim - love that line: \"Not admitting you\u2019re wrong makes you part of your own cult.\" and also makes you a bit of a cult :-)"}, {"user_id": "ddafec055082", "comment_time": 1650025563200, "comment": "There are hurt people who challenge your dreams - but also frightened people.

Don\u2019t let it be you.\nPhoto by F\u00e1bio Lucas on Unsplash\nOnline writing is an illusion.\nIt looks easy. Loads of wannabes try. They emulate headlines, they try to work out what the algorithm will promote, they follow top writers.\nAnd then after years, they never succeed.\nI see it all the time. See, my online academy has trained 1000s of writers.\nRecently it hit me what I accidentally learned to do that 99% of writers don\u2019t do because they either don\u2019t understand, or have never witnessed the power of what I\u2019m about to share.\nThis story has a huge promise in the headline, I know. But if you pay attention for a couple of minutes, this will change everything.\nLet me explain.\nThe moment I got kicked in the balls\nIn 2018 I quit my job in a bank to work at an iconic social media agency. I got to manage 16 account managers. I felt badass.\nI bragged about the new job on LinkedIn. Everyone high-fived me on my way out of the bank I worked at.\nThen only a few months later I got fired from the job. It nearly destroyed me. I was beside myself. I risked everything and lost. I failed in spectacularly stupid fashion. I was the laughingstock of LinkedIn.\nOne critic said \u201chow does a guy with hundreds of thousands of followers become such a dumbass and get fired?\u201d\nIt hurt like hell. I said nothing. I hid the emotion. I told no one. I lied to people in my career and told them I still had the job, even though I didn\u2019t.\nI even convinced the Head of HR at my ex-employer to let me keep my employment status active on my LinkedIn profile so potential new employers wouldn\u2019t know I was unemployed.\nI felt desperate.\nThe redemption moment from nowhere\nOne afternoon I decided to sit down and write about the experience. I only intended it to be read by me. This gave me license to kill my ego.\nSo I wrote the damn story.\nI cried as I wrote it.\nIt was like watching my grandma in her final moments before she died. It felt like the day I helped place her coffin in the grave and threw gingerbread men on top of the casket because she used to make them for me as a child.\nLittle did I know, the emotion of it all bled into the writing.\nThen I sat with it for a few days.\nOne night I said to myself f*ck it, I have to share this story. It can help so many people who\u2019ve felt like I do right now.\nSo I posted it on LinkedIn.\nTo date, it\u2019s one of the most successful pieces of writing I\u2019ve EVER published.\nWhat writers don\u2019t do that kills their potential\nOkay, so it\u2019s time to deliver on my promise.\nMost online writers don\u2019t add emotion.\nEverything they publish is dry and lifeless. They hide behind a mask. Their personality doesn\u2019t shine through. They\u2019re petrified of how they\u2019ll look. The comments section keeps them awake at night.\nBut if you don\u2019t show vulnerability then readers quietly switch off.\nEmotion is a magnet.\nWhen we feel what you\u2019re saying through the emotion in your words, it enters our brains differently. So few writers do it. But the ones that do get miles ahead of the ones who don\u2019t.\nIt\u2019s not easy though \u2014 to bleed all over the page and face ridicule.\nAfter doing this for 8 years, I\u2019m convinced it makes the difference\nDoesn\u2019t mean you need to cry and be an emotional wreck in every story. It does mean you need to add more emotion though.\nI\u2019ve analyzed the best articles on this platform and others. This is the secret you\u2019ve been searching for.\nWhat you must know, though, is it can\u2019t be manufactured. Emotion has to be real. People have to believe it. It has to come from your heart. It must flow out of you like a river.\nAnd when the emotion does pour out, the best writing of your career gets written. It\u2019ll change your life. You\u2019ll get a taste of the bittersweet victory that is inspiring people you\u2019ll never meet to overcome their own struggles.\nHow to trigger this secret weapon at will\nWhen you sit down to write it\u2019s easy to feel indifferent, maybe even a little tired. You can\u2019t always be in a highly charged emotional state.\nWhat I do is put myself in an emotional state. How?\nI go to Youtube and re-watch videos that bring out emotion. If I want to feel sad then I\u2019ll watch a cancer battle. If I want to feel happy then I\u2019ll watch a motivational video.\nIf I want to feel anger then I\u2019ll watch a video on big tech silencing creators. If I want to cry then I\u2019ll visit my go-to videos \u2014 like the one with the woman who went to court because of her fines, and then told the judge her son had got murdered, so the judge showed empathy and let her off everything.\nWhen you feel another person\u2019s emotions it triggers your own.\nTakeaway\nGet into the emotional state you want to write with before you sit down to write. Adding emotion makes your writing become widely shared. We do it and we don\u2019t even know why.\nThat\u2019s the quiet power emotions have over humanity.\nUnleash your inner writer\ud83d\udd25.

Many treat it like the Hunger Games.\nPhoto by Paulina Patterson on Unsplash\nWealthy creators are rare.\nMost hang in the pigpens full of mud in toxic Facebook groups complaining and blaming their entire creator dreams on someone other than themselves.\nI\u2019ve been lucky to meet many wealthy creators. They\u2019re wealthy because they prioritize their peace of mind and their free time.\nOn a recent Twitter Space I hosted with Sean Kernan, he reminded me of many of these habits. Adopt them to become a kickass creator.\nThey use money to make money\nWealthy creators are investors at heart.\nThe money they make as creators isn\u2019t used to buy dumb luxury cars or show off. Nope.\nIt\u2019s invested back into assets \u2014 both financial and digital assets. These assets generate passive income for them while they sleep.\nEventually, the passive income allows them to slow down with creation, so they can spend more time enjoying life.\nThey prioritize lifting other creators up\nThe creator economy is a family. Many treat it like the Hunger Games.\nThe wealthiest creators don\u2019t just selfishly try and reach their own milestones. No. They help other creators.\nWhy?\nBecause someone did the same for them. Inspired by seeing Sean help other creators, I put together a Twitter Thread of the best up-and-coming creators.\nUsing my audience to build a beginner\u2019s audience is a habit I learned from the best. Copy. Share, \u2018like\u2019, and comment on other creators\u2019 content. Don\u2019t do it expecting anything in return. Do it because it\u2019s the right thing.\nWhen beginner creators rise through the ranks they remember who helped them. Being part of someone else\u2019s success story is the best legacy you can create before you die.\nThey don\u2019t rely on one creator platform\nCreators have an overwhelming number of platforms to post their content on.\nThe wealthiest creators treat platforms the way they treat their investment portfolio.\nThey ensure their risk is diversified in case one platform creates a dumb moderation policy, or destroys their user interface or homepage with yet another useless feature.\nThe one platform life destroys creator dreams. The creators I know have at least three platforms they create on.\nThey own their audience\nCreator wealth isn\u2019t generated by collecting useless followers, likes, and views. These are the desires of a creator heading towards bankruptcy.\nWealthy creators own their audience by bringing them to their email list.\nBut you\u2019re smart and knew that already. I met one wealthy creator who blew my mind. The problem with email lists is users can unsubscribe if you send one bad email \u2014 or if you email them on a day when their inbox is overloaded.\nAll that hard work dies when your audience unsubscribes.\nWhat you need is an insurance policy. The wealthy creator I met uses a Discord group as a backup. If a user opts out of email then she still has them in Discord. Genius.\nAn audience you don\u2019t own is one you have to rent with either enormous amounts of your time, or by buying ads from platforms.\nScrew that.\nThey do a lot of online courses\nThis year I\u2019ve paid for more than ten online courses.\nI learned from the wealthiest creators that you have to be a learning machine to stay at the top of the game. I could have found the information in these courses on my own, but it would have taken an eternity.\nOnline courses are curation that\u2019s done for you to save time. Saving time equals saving money.\nMore time gives you more hours to create.\nOnly bankrupt creators diss online courses because they\u2019re too lazy to earn and don\u2019t believe in making money. Stupid.\nYou have to spend money as a creator to make money as a creator.\nThey maintain a low ego\nEgo destroys wealth.\nSuccess as a creator can cause you to lose the plot and start posting content about the end of America to save your life, if you\u2019re not careful.\nDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve been there and written stuff that accidentally landed in this dangerous territory.\nWealthy creators don\u2019t think they\u2019re smart or amazing. They think they\u2019re hardworking and a little lucky.\nThe gap between your current creator income and the amount you want is closed with humility.\nNo one likes a douchebag creator.\nThey have systems to enable automation\nThey have creator habits that help them know what to do next.\nThey don\u2019t wait to feel like creating \u2014 their motivation is deeply ingrained in their brain because they\u2019ve shown up every day for more than a year.\nEnergy management is a priority. Without energy they can\u2019t create. So they don\u2019t waste the best hours of the day in their email inbox or scrolling social media. They use their best hours to create.\nIdeas aren\u2019t an accident either.\nThey have a second brain that stores every idea and piece of content they come across that\u2019s useful. When the time comes to create they can pull from this database with complete ease.\nSystems make creativity look stupidly simple.\nThey adopt a high-performance mindset\nOptimism is a common trait amongst wealthy creators.\nThey don\u2019t have all the answers but they\u2019ve programmed their brain to believe they\u2019ll find the solutions they seek.\nThey understand that their psychology is directly proportionate to their success as a creator. So they read psychology books, train their brain, spend time with great thinkers, and see the world better than it is.\nThey don\u2019t roll in the mud with pigs\nWealthy creators attract critics and haters.\nInstead of rolling in the mud with the loudmouth pigs and getting their g-string in a knot, they simply get on with it. They don\u2019t let one moron ruin their day or stop them from creating.\nThe mute, block, and ignore buttons are always within reach \u2014 although they try not to use them too often.\nThey value time over money\nTheir goal isn\u2019t to make a million dollars. It\u2019s to continue to create with fewer and fewer limitations on their creativity.\nThey never want to have to go back to a job again or be told what to do.\nSo they create as best as they can to keep ownership of their time away from slave-driving corporations that seek to exploit them for profit.\nCreator success looks like an empty calendar.\nUnleash your inner writer\ud83d\udd25.

I can get all of the fresh vegetables I can carry from the farmer\u2019s market for less than $10, I can afford an apartment in a building with a pool, and my health insurance plan \u2014 the best available \u2014 is about $100 a month. Even though I\u2019ve learned I can be miserable or happy in just about any kind of weather, the climate is an added bonus: 75\u02daF and sunny all year.\nI have to admit, the lack of American*-level convenience was one of the factors that held me back. Can you imagine living without Amazon Prime? Still, I can get items from Amazon within about 2 weeks (after paying 30% extra on shipping and import taxes).\nBut the challenging parts of living in a developing country are the parts that make it worth doing. For example, since I\u2019m operating in Spanish day-to-day \u2014 and interacting with people from a totally different culture \u2014 I\u2019m forced to constantly assume that I\u2019m wrong. The foreigner is always wrong. This is a kind of \u201cpatience therapy.\u201d At first I get frustrated easily, but the relaxed rhythm of Colombian life eventually takes over.\nFor reference, New York City has the opposite effect. It fools me into thinking that I\u2019m right, and there\u2019s somewhere I have to be.\nIt\u2019s hard to quantify the value of immersing yourself in another culture. Like a cold shower, it\u2019s all at the same time shocking, refreshing, and invigorating. Once I reached the level of Spanish where I was able to give directions on the street, I felt like I had discovered a secret level on Super Mario Bros..\nSuddenly, the world felt bigger. Not only could I now travel in newfound comfort in 13 countries, I had \u2014 in the process of learning and living \u2014 developed a new understanding of humanity at large: Having a sense of the universality of emotions like happiness, fear, and love; and the myriad ways of navigating all of it, brought vibrance to every face I saw on the street.\nWhen Tim Ferriss asked Malcolm Gladwell what advice he would have for his 30-year-old self, his response was quick, and simple: \u201cLeave North America\u2026. Which is \u2014 despite the fact that it pretends to be the only place that matters \u2014 is not the only place that matters.\u201d He then recalled an opportunity he had to live in Jamaica. \u201cI should have done it,\u201d he said.\nI wonder about the details of Mr. Gladwell\u2019s decision-making process when he passed up that opportunity. I imagine that the conveniences and familiarity of his home country felt even more comfortable when wrapped in a blanket of fear of the unknown.\nOf course, it was a different world twenty-two years ago. There was no Skype or Facebook. He couldn\u2019t just log onto JOL (Jamaica Online) to send an email to a friend. My own geographic flexibility would be unthinkable without impromptu FaceTime chats with my parents, and scheduled Hangouts with close friends.\nI also imagine someone as accomplished as Mr. Gladwell was driven by his career aspirations. When you feel like you\u2019re in \u201cthe only place that matters,\u201d competing with your Washington Post colleagues, running off to Jamaica looks like career suicide.\nI personally had to overcome the sense that by running off to South America, I was somehow admitting defeat in \u201cThe America Game.\u201d But, this isn\u2019t the first time that I\u2019ve left the well-worn path for something counterintuitive. Eight years ago, I left my life as a product designer for Silicon Valley startups \u2014 job opportunities nipping at my tail. I didn\u2019t have a plan in mind, but I eventually transformed into a writer, teacher, and podcaster. These are all things I can do from abroad, and in fact, I do my best work when in Colombia because I\u2019m just happier here.\nSometimes I think about what my life would be like if I had stayed on that path (as if I could have stomached it). I\u2019d probably be using my good fortune to build products that do whatever my mom doesn\u2019t do for me anymore, paying $3,000 a month for a studio apartment, and looking for the next molecular gastronomy restaurant to cross off my bucket list.\nI know that sounds sanctimonious, as if my flexible lifestyle weren\u2019t made possible by innovators in Silicon Valley and beyond. It\u2019s just that sometimes I think about how each of us could be living a life different from the one we\u2019re living \u2014 a life that would actually make us happier \u2014 yet we have no way of knowing about it. We\u2019re like dogs that haven\u2019t figured out that the doggy door isn\u2019t just a solid wall.\nI think about a well-intentioned product designer in his studio apartment, shoving the last bite of pad thai he ordered from Seamless into his mouth while rushing to his Uber to drink craft cocktails. While surrounded by people discussing the latest TechCrunch article, he feels a faint sense of dissatisfaction \u2014 a sense that he\u2019s not good enough. He takes another drink and forgets about it.\nI wish he would reconsider. I wish he would seek out discomfort, face his insecurities, and live a life on the great frontier that technology has expanded for so many of us.\nAnd even when I hear a real innovator like Elon Musk fantasize about colonizing Mars \u2014 as exciting an idea as that is \u2014 I cringe a little. The same way a magician waving his hand will keep you from seeing the dove he\u2019s pulling from his pocket, I fear it will make people forget about the Earth, and humanity, and human experience \u2014 and how much of all of it each of us has yet to explore.\n* I don\u2019t like to call U.S. Citizens \u201cAmericans\u201d (Colombia is also in The Americas), but I\u2019m not sure what else to call us.", "comment_count": 165, "like_count": 2054, "created_time": 1471273195594, "comment": [{"user_id": "5377a93ef640", "comment_time": 1471273195594, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "56351a8d7f1f", "comment_time": 1471368865338, "comment": "It\u2019s interesting to note Gladwell\u2019s personal history here as well.

Pretty cool, right? Here\u2019s how I did it.\nBlip Billboards lets you advertise all over the U.S.\nI used a site called Blip Billboards ($25 free credit). It allows you to advertise on billboards all over the U.S., paying per \u201cblip,\u201d or 15-second display of your ad.\nI knew that, using Blip, I could advertise my book in Times Square, but I also knew that I couldn\u2019t be there to see it myself. I would need to hire a photographer.\nRunning a test billboard in Chicago\nSo, to make it worth my while, I first ran a test. I don\u2019t live in the U.S., so I couldn\u2019t run a test where I live.\nI chose my former home of Chicago, and put out a call for a photo on Twitter. Fortunately, a couple readers responded. Here\u2019s one of their photos.\nThe test billboard I first ran in Chicago.\nI got 722 \u201cblips\u201d for a little more than $65. That came out to about 9\u00a2 per blip.\n\nRunning a test in Times Square\nNow that I had tested the concept of buying a billboard, I ran another test in Times Square. Here\u2019s what Blip\u2019s bidding system looks like.\n\nOn the left-hand side, you see times and days you can select during which you\u2019d like your billboard to display. On the right, you see and can adjust the values associated with each of the three bid levels you can apply to the schedule.\n$20 per blip is the minimum bid for a Times Square billboard. I ran a test at this price, and it displayed once one day, but didn\u2019t display the next. If I was going to hire a photographer, I wanted to be sure my billboard would show up.\nThe moment of truth\u2026\nI set a $250 budget for between 8\u20139 p.m. on a Tuesday, bid $31 per blip, and scheduled a photographer to shoot my ad. In retrospect, I should have played with bids of $20.01, $20.02, or $20.03, which would probably beat some competitors for the ad space.\nI actually ran two ads. You already saw the first (at the top). Here\u2019s the second.\nMy second billboard, advertising my message to the world.\nMy ad ran twenty times within that hour. Along with the tests, I spent $290 advertising in Times Square, but you could do it for as little as $20.\n\nDid my ad sell books? I don\u2019t really know. My book recently crossed the 10,000-copies-sold mark, and I wanted to celebrate with something fun. (It\u2019s already very close to 15,000!)\nI do know that when I shared this second billboard on Twitter, Tim Ferriss retweeted it to his 1.8 million followers.\nMy tweet showing my ad \u00bb\nI did see a bump in sales that day.\n\nAll told I spent about $500, maybe sold some books, and definitely had fun.\nUPDATE, April 12, 2022: Now several days after Tim Ferriss\u2019s tweet, I\u2019ve noticed a nice lift in paperback sales (paperbacks often take a while to show up in reports).

But I laughed hysterically when I read the final option: \u201cI don\u2019t like music.\u201d\nIt seemed impossible that someone could not like music. Little did I know, I, myself, would come to not like music.\nIt started at the grocery store. I suddenly realized I had been staring at citrus fruits for a solid two minutes. Why? Because \u201cHello,\u201d by Adele had been playing.\nAt the time, there was someone from my past from whom I longed to receive a call like the one described in the song\u2019s lyrics. I wanted to know this woman was thinking about me. I wanted to know she regretted leaving. I wanted her to call a thousand times to tell me she was sorry for everything she had done.\nSo there in that grocery store, I had daydreamt that Adele\u2019s voice was the voice of my ex. I had felt fine when I had gotten to the grocery store, but by the time I had left, I had wanted to go home, close the shades, get in bed, and cry.\n\u201cFuck,\u201d I muttered to myself. \u201cI just wanted to buy a lemon.\u201d\nAt some point when I was less vulnerable to the lyrics of \u201cHello,\u201d I heard it at the grocery store, again. I looked around, and noticed several different people mouthing the lyrics.\nI didn\u2019t know how these people felt, but one woman looked particularly catatonic: She was pushing her shopping cart in a zombie-like cadence, eyes floating from one side of the cereal aisle to another as she seemed to lament to someone that it doesn\u2019t tear them apart anymore.\nThis was when it dawned on me that much of the success of \u201cHello\u201d was probably due to how its lyrics gave voice to people\u2019s fantasies. Nearly everyone has someone from their past from whom they want receive such a call. Maybe not desperately, as I had; but you have to admit it would be nice\u2014if only to tell that person to fuck off.\n\u201cHello\u201d is of course far from the only song that can turn your emotions on a dime. The popular music canon is full of songs about love and loss, about telling your momma you just killed a man and wish you\u2019d never been born at all, or that command you to clap along if you feel that happiness is the truth.\nThe problem isn\u2019t that I hate music. The problem is, I love music. It\u2019s for this reason I don\u2019t like music. Maybe not in the eharmony sense of not liking music, but I don\u2019t think we need music in every grocery store, restaurant, cafe, and\u2014God forbid\u2014elevator.\nMusic changes your thoughts and emotions.

Whether it should be as necessary as it right now is a matter up for debate, but as long as it is, we have to address accessibility and affordability. It\u2019s interesting, then, that our current proposals all have to do with shifting rather than addressing the cost.\nHave the government pay for college for everyone. Have the government pay for college for some people. Have the government pay for some of college for everyone. Or my personal solution: make college less of a requirement and more of an option. It doesn\u2019t particularly matter where you fall on that spectrum because we\u2019re covering something different. None of these suggestions, including my own, look at the main factor: the cost.\nI can understand why that might be. With the large numbers they employ nationally across the United States, combined with their massive revenues, colleges are a formidable foe. Change-resistant and seemingly insulated from public criticism in the debate that rages around their problems, they somehow avoid being in the conversation about higher education. Politicians would be foolish to publicly threaten such a well-armed opponent.\nLuckily, there\u2019s one thing I have never been and never will be: a politician. So let\u2019s look at this the way we would any other enterprise: realistically. And realistically, the college curriculum, business model, and methodology are woefully outdated and relatively unchanged in the last century or so. No wonder the institution is out of touch with the modern world.\nFortunately, one simple move can cut costs for future students immediately.\nThe well-rounded student myth\nAh, the well-rounded student. Harkening back to the days when all the information in the world wasn\u2019t easily accessible in 30 seconds or less, the concept of general education courses as part of a degree program was widely accepted. It would give students access to other topics and expose them to areas their actual degree of choice may not.\nThey also make up about a full year (or more) of a four-year degree and thus represent 25% of the cost of college. They should be done away with for good.\nHow rounded? This round? More round-er? Photo by Milad Fakurian on Unsplash\nThere is a portion of our population that just loves formal education. I\u2019ve met them, I\u2019ve spoken to them, we\u2019ve hashed out this argument for hours at hotel lobby bars during overlapping conferences back in my drinking days. Even they have privately conceded that these courses are unnecessary when we have such a major financial problem with student loans.\nIf you really want to learn, in a formal environment, about all sorts of things that have nothing to do with your degree program, you\u2019re welcome to. You can stay in school taking courses for as long as financially feasible through government loans, trust funds, or cash. If you think it\u2019s worth it, all the more power to you.\nBut we shouldn\u2019t force it on all students. Let\u2019s face it: about half of college students don\u2019t want to be there in the first place when you get down to it. Hell, even half of the parents don\u2019t want their kids to go straight to college any longer (a fact which delights me, I\u2019ll admit).\nThis latter group is in college because they\u2019ve been told their entire life they\u2019ll be failures if they don\u2019t attend. They\u2019ve chosen a degree based on practicality and job placement, not the love of learning, and want to keep their head down and get through this mandatory exercise as quickly as possible. If they happen to be able to survive on their salary when they graduate and not default on their student loans, it\u2019s a win.\nSo, for this practical group, what\u2019s the real situation? You\u2019re forced to do this thing you don\u2019t care for, and you\u2019re going to take out what amounts to a full mortgage in order to do it. You\u2019ll have to pick a field more or less at random with little prior exposure to it, which is going to set the course for the rest of your life. Oh, and we\u2019re going to make it 25% longer and 25% more expensive than it needs to be by requiring courses that neither you nor any future employer will care about at all. Sound good? Great.\nHelping no one; stuck in the past\nThis does a disservice to everyone. Employers who pay for college often carve out requirements like: \u201cMust be a course directly related to finance, business, accounting or a similar discipline.\u201d So even those who are getting some help are left on their own to pay for the most useless courses in their program.\nForcing something on a student never really results in an eye-opening experience either. They need to come to it naturally over the course of their daily lives. In today\u2019s day and age, anybody with even a modicum of curiosity has gone down a Wikipedia rabbit hole or something similar on a topic of their choice. That is how people come to education, not being force-fed for $25,000+ a year.\nThe instructor isn\u2019t guaranteed to be less biased than any other source, either. Photo by NeONBRAND on Unsplash\nIt does a disservice to the professors who love those topics, as half their environmental history class is filled with condescending finance students who are trying to duck out of a general education requirement. The actual environmental history students must share their learning space with people who don\u2019t care about the subject and detract from the environment. Does all of this sound like a justified and useful way to spend tens of thousands of dollars?\nIt serves no practical purpose either and is even more laughable in the information age. I\u2019ve never interviewed a candidate for a job and said the following:\n\u201cWell, I see you got your finance degree at TCNJ. That used to be Trenton State, right? Yeah, that\u2019s a good school. I\u2019m glad your degree is in finance but let me ask you something: can you explain the overarching theme of Dostoevsky\u2019s The Possessed? No? I\u2019m sorry, but we\u2019re going to have to go in a different direction for this position.\u201d\nSure, that could make for an interesting conversation, and I\u2019d be more than happy to discuss literature outside of work. But employers couldn\u2019t possibly care less. Back in the day, the anti-college rhetoric was that the knowledge you obtained wasn\u2019t anything you couldn\u2019t get with a library card and $1.50 in late charges (per Good Will Hunting). I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s true overall, but it certainly is for the general education requirements. Except you don\u2019t even need the library card anymore, provided you have the internet.\nA modest proposal\nAnd not of the Jonathan Swift variety, either. I believe what I\u2019ve suggested here is perfectly attainable and logical. We could easily go even more narrow: a finance degree could be trimmed of general education and marketing courses. Similarly, a marketing program could drop calculus and corporate finance, etc.\nAgainst my own deeply held convictions, I\u2019m also leaving the colleges themselves alone in this. I\u2019m not looking at bloat, duplicate positions, unrestrained salaries, poor tenure programs, and money spent more on protecting the college as an institution than serving its students. I\u2019ll give a temporary pass on all that. If I didn\u2019t, by the time we were done with this article a bachelor\u2019s degree would be a two-year program at 70% of the cost per year. Even I might entertain finishing a degree in that environment, but it will never come to be.\nInstead, my proposal is simple. Getting a chemistry degree? Study science. And only science. That\u2019s what you\u2019re here for. Finance? Business courses only for you. So on and so forth. If you want to be exposed to more things, you\u2019re welcome to stay an extra year past the three-year graduation path. All that\u2019d result in is the same cost you were expecting anyway.\nFor everyone else, let\u2019s cut them a break. The education system that we force on our adolescents and young adults is broken enough already. Let\u2019s give them a bit of their money back while still providing the practical knowledge they came for. Plus, they\u2019ll get something truly invaluable to any adult: a full year of their life back.", "comment_count": 4, "like_count": 202, "created_time": 1647529494926, "comment": [{"user_id": "e4d087f259b9", "comment_time": 1647529494926, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "97b1ee3d4e55", "comment_time": 1648537490544, "comment": "Great article"}, {"user_id": "91c7cc8f7693", "comment_time": 1647624974001, "comment": "Thank you for the thought-provoking article.

Look before you buy.\nFear isn\u2019t just of the abandoned-church variety. Photo by Kevin Bosc on Unsplash\nAh, fear of missing out. The dreaded \u201cFOMO.\u201d It\u2019s how pump-and-dump schemers earn their living. It\u2019s how influencers suck people in on the latest product \u201ctrends\u201d and gain marketing dollars. It\u2019s why high school students use drugs. It brings introverts to parties that are one step away from their personal hell. Sound good? No!? Then, by all means, keep it out of your investments.\nI hate the FOMO abbreviation as it sounds ridiculous, likely due to its phonetic similarities with YOLO, a phrase uttered immediately before doing the dumbest thing possible at that given moment. As a result, from here on in, we\u2019ll be calling it \u201cThe Fear.\u201d Much more ominous. Foreboding.\nThe Fear has seemed to grab ahold of a huge swath of investors recently. I\u2019m not talking about just the stock market, either, though it\u2019s a large part of the discussion. Record-low interest rates and soaring real estate prices have driven The Fear into that market as well.\nPeople jumped off the sidelines and ran as quick as their legs would carry them straight into the nearest overpriced home. Those juiced sale prices were then used as comparison properties on new appraisals, justifying more price increases. Those price increases were then reported in the media and struck The Fear into the hearts of millions more. So on and so forth. The last one standing in this musical chair game won\u2019t get a consolation prize.\nThe volatility in the stock market during the pandemic inspired a different wave of stories. People were making millions buying options, running up nearly dead companies like AMC or GameStop, playing the volatility itself, etc. Hoards of people who knew next-to-nothing about investing came down with The Fear and started pouring their money into things they barely understood.\nAll of this needs to stop. I love the fact that more people are getting involved with their finances. Our financial futures are irrevocably linked to our quality of life and happiness, like it or not. More people taking an active interest in shaping their own is a good thing. Just not when they\u2019re being led astray by carnival barkers.\nLoudness does not equal correctness\nContent creators share some of the blame in all this. It\u2019s so easy to just regurgitate garbage about what made the biggest moves this week, what new coin is trending, how houses will go up in value to $10,000,000 per square foot, whatever. This is the personal finance equivalent of misdemeanor criminal negligence \u2014 you might not be trying to harm someone, but your actions are leading to harm nonetheless.\nThe sheer volume of stories out there convinces people that something is going on, and they\u2019re missing it. This is the basis for The Fear. Unfortunately, the group shouting the loudest is not always the group with the best information, or your best interests at heart, for that matter. Just like the man inciting you to try the carnival-game ring-toss, they only want two things: your eyes on them and your money in their pocket.\nQuick riches are always alluring. The reality is never as simple as \u201cBuy X, become a millionaire.\u201d Almost all of these investments are extremely risky and volatile in the near term, and thus most of these spectacular reported earnings involved a good deal of luck and timing the market. Such conditions are rarely, if ever duplicated, and are not a great strategy, to begin with.\nThe more volatile the investment, the stronger your knowledge should be before purchasing it. I\u2019ve been an active investor since I started working, which was before I could drive. 18 years into this game, I still triple-check myself before committing 0.07% of my portfolio into something as risky as commodities, let alone assets that could lose half their value in the coming months (or days).\nPhoto by Patrick Fore on Unsplash\nYes, stories abound of people making fortunes in all sorts of stuff during the last couple of years. Good for them. Problem is that those stories suffer from something rare in our media \u2014 a positivity bias. People are more likely to share their gains than losses. It\u2019s like that friend you have who definitely has a gambling problem. Interesting that they\u2019re still dirt poor despite all those $10,000 jackpot wins they\u2019ve had, isn\u2019t it?\nThe other problem is that human nature wants a quick fix. If you have my type of personality, you\u2019re always looking at what\u2019s right in front of you. In work, in relationships, in life, it\u2019s the next immediate thing, always. I\u2019ve spent years keeping that (dominant) part of my personality in check when it comes to investing. Because the safe, sure, long-term way to play it is contradictory to how I do things. That doesn\u2019t make it wrong, though \u2014 that makes me wrong.\nWe all have more confidence and ego than we\u2019d like to admit. A lot of bad investments could be stopped in their tracks if we acknowledged our fallibility. A simple question or two could do it.\n\u201cCould I be wrong? Do I understand what I\u2019m buying and why?\u201d\nMy investing started in earnest around 2007. That might sound unfortunate, but in reality, it was a great lesson. Nothing teaches you lessons quicker than a 50% loss of assets. Luckily I was extremely young, and it was a negligible total, but still. First thing I learned? An asset being down significantly doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s \u201cbound\u201d to go up. Second? Follow trends at your own risk. K Hovnanian homes didn\u2019t fare too well, but boy were those homebuilders on fire in the mid-2000s.\nIn short, invest in what you know. For a little while, I managed the operations of two Marriott properties. Don\u2019t ask how and why that came to be for a lifelong banker, just accept it. So if two businesses are looking for an active manager/investor down here, which should I choose? The Korean Fusion taco place that has an open-air bar serving non-alcoholic CBD beverages, or the boutique hotel on the water?\nThe correct answer is my choice is actually between the hotel and neither. But Korean Fusion and CBD are trendy in all the right places! Why would I not invest in a sure thing?\nBecause I wouldn\u2019t have the faintest idea what I was doing, that\u2019s why. I don\u2019t know enough about the field to even value the business properly, I couldn\u2019t guess what\u2019s necessary for day-to-day operations, and my visual inspection of the place would probably be next-to-useless compared to that of an industry pro. Does even the image of a banker in a full suit attempting to make boutique tacos sound logical?\nFor all I know there are adverse reactions to every one of those CBD beverages and I\u2019d be serving poison unknowingly. The business has a bunch of possible pitfalls and I\u2019d be blind to all of them. I can come back to the idea only after a ton of research.\nThere are always other options\nPeople have heard their whole lives that their money should always be working for them, and it should. That underlying assumption makes people vulnerable to bad investments. Admitting you don\u2019t know enough about something to invest confidently is not weakness \u2014 it\u2019s strength. It\u2019ll save you money in the long run while simultaneously motivating you to learn more.\nPhoto by Elena Mozhvilo on Unsplash\nDon\u2019t get ensnared by all the get-rich-quick articles and come down with The Fear. If only we had some sort of full disclosure system where everyone who writes a clickbait-y pump-and-dump article was legally obligated to provide updates weekly in the same style. \u201cI Invested $50,000 in Ravencoin at Quadruple Leverage on Monday and on Thursday It Was Worth $8!\u201d I\u2019d read it.\nYou might be rightly saying to yourself: \u201cI don\u2019t have the time to research every single thing on Earth, Pete. You\u2019re full of it.\u201d That\u2019s fine, too. Because there are investments for people who don\u2019t know anything about investing other than the fact that they should do it. Managed funds. Index funds. Hell, even a CD is a better choice than roulette when it comes to your future.\nPlenty of investors who are very experienced and know very well what they\u2019re doing will still opt for an index fund. Why? They\u2019re honest with themselves. Picking the three or four big winners out of thousands of options isn\u2019t a guarantee. They\u2019d rather just own the whole market. Their money is at work, and they can set it and forget it.\nI guess that\u2019s a tacit endorsement of index investing, and for many people, I think it is the right choice. Others may love researching companies, industry trends, and forecasts. It\u2019s not a burden for them to be active, intelligent investors \u2014 it\u2019s fun for them. These folks might avoid index investing but they still understand what they\u2019re putting their money into.\nUltimately, investing is personal. You have your own goals, your own risks, your own rate of savings, and your own preferences. What to do with all that information and how to put that money to work is up to the individual investor. Just make sure you understand what you\u2019re getting into. The Fear never works out well in the long run.\nBecome A Money Master\nJoin 6,000+ millionaires in the making and access our weekly Substack.\nThis article is for informational purposes only.

Don\u2019t Buy the Cookie-Cutter Nonsense.\nDon\u2019t let traditional savings goals or strategies get you down \u2014 or give you anxiety.\nPhoto by Mollie Sivaram on Unsplash\nNowhere do generalizations soar higher than in personal financial advice. People dispense age-old sayings as if they\u2019re revolutionary thinking, while other personal finance \u201cgurus\u201d hand-out general wisdom as if it\u2019s the key to life itself. This is all well and good, and I have no doubt that many of these advice-givers are well-intentioned. Still, they miss one major point.\nInvesting is extremely personal. And not in the generalized sort of way that most financial advisers use, like based on your age or income level, though that is relevant. Investing is much more unique than that \u2014 I\u2019d argue it\u2019s tied to your core personality. Impulsiveness, risk tolerance, goals, life objectives, lifespan, and others. In summary, no one person is alike. But we treat financial advice as if the whole world can be broken into five or six groups.\n\u201cInvest X % in Y if you\u2019re Z years old.\u201d That\u2019s a classic one. \u201cBased on your retirement horizon, increase your 401k contribution to X.\u201d Another age-old winner. Others include making sure you have enough money to last until you turn 85 or so, not timing the market, and keeping emotions out of investing.\nSome of these are useful reminders. Others are situational and can be discarded depending on the individual. Without taking into account lifestyle factors, personal preferences, and immediate goals, these \u201chard\u201d pieces of financial advice are no different than the self-help book encouraging you to \u201cbe your best self\u201d \u2014 useless.\nSo why do we continue to recommend the same things over and over again? Yes, I know conventional wisdom is conventional because it has a proven track record. Still, someone who opposes the risk of the stock market at the very core of their being is not going to be persuaded through repetition. Even if they were, at the first sign of a decline they\u2019re going to withdraw their money and give you an \u201cI told you so.\u201d\nWe need to start being franker and more open-minded when it comes to financial advice. One-size-fits-all has increasingly fit none. It\u2019s far past time for the financial services field to understand that.\nRisk-on, risk-off\nAn era or two ago, retirement was consistently referred to as a three-legged stool. One leg for each part of your retirement: pension, 401k, social security. As the first leg disappeared and the third became insufficient to rest on, the remaining leg was left to support the whole stool. Try that in real life and let me know how it works out. It has had similar \u201csuccess\u201d in retirement planning.\nIt was never envisioned that someone\u2019s entire financial future would rest on the volatility of the markets. Somewhere along the line we just accepted that, but it wasn\u2019t how the system was designed. It\u2019s just what we have left. As a result, the people who are fortunate enough to have any savings at all tend to have disproportionate exposure to risky assets, whether they know it or not. That exposure is through their 401k.\nThat alone represents too much volatility for many people. I see financial statements every day, and you\u2019d be amazed how many people have no 401k and instead have $300,000 in a CD or savings account. It\u2019s way more common than you would think. Yes, they\u2019re leaving the matching money from their employer on the table. No, I don\u2019t recommend it. Still, they do it.\nPhoto by Bra\u0148o on Unsplash\nThe reason for this is simple and it\u2019s one that financial advisors don\u2019t like admitting because it reduces their importance \u2014 if you\u2019re earning enough straight money for the retirement you want, there\u2019s no need to put it at risk. With inflation, that\u2019s increasingly difficult of course. Most people want to earn more, and many fear that they\u2019re leaving free money on the table, so they invest well past the point that they\u2019re comfortable. But others just don\u2019t.\nOf course, not too many people are sufficiently well-off to do that, but if you are, good for you. If I started magically making $1,000,000.00 a year, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d push my luck. I\u2019d continue living off $50,000, bank the rest, pull the pin in five years, and retire. No need to put it all at risk in the meantime.\nDo you think it was comforting for those who were set to retire in 2009 to hear that only 40% of their assets lost half their value? No, it literally clawed years of their life away that they\u2019d need to spend working. I don\u2019t blame those who are a little gun shy. Yes, the market always goes up in the long run. Or so goes the conventional wisdom. Housing values were a sure bet too until they weren\u2019t.\nFor the rest of us, though, we won\u2019t be making enough to have a comfortable retirement using our one-legged stool. That leaves a risk-on scenario for most of us. What we do then is equally personal.\nA matter of preference\nSo, you must invest and must take some risks to have a chance at retirement. What now? Well, cookie-cutter financial advice will have an answer. Based on your age, current savings, retirement age, and standard of living, financial advisors will have a handy calculator that tells you what to save and how to invest it. Most firms are now savvy enough to even \u201ctailor\u201d your investments to your risk tolerance, giving an illusion of control.\nNow to be clear, I\u2019m not saying all of this is bad, necessarily. For many, or even most, these portfolios will work just fine. I just want to highlight that sometimes real life calls for different math, different scenarios. Pardon the coarseness, but forcing everyone into a pre-constructed box will always screw over a portion of the population that doesn\u2019t fit inside of it. Conventional careers, formal education, and others are great examples of similarly well-intentioned but poor-in-practice boxes.\nThe first problem and the one encountered most often is a simple one:\n\u201cWhat if you just don\u2019t make enough money?\u201d\nYeah, I know, some guy is going to say he lived in a cardboard box eating discarded McDonald's off the freeway for 47 years and then retired in an Orange County Mansion at 65 after making only $24,000 a year. But in the real world, sometimes you just don\u2019t have enough left over after your bills to match what the \u201cretirement calculator\u201d is saying.\nThis is the opposite scenario of those described earlier \u2014 no amount of conventional risk is going to result in a comfortable retirement. So if you follow all the typical advice you\u2019ll be left with a measly monthly stipend and social security, meaning you\u2019ll still have to work. Given that outcome, why not take the crazy risk? If it comes down to \u201cwork \u2019til I die\u201d or \u201cmaybe retire\u201d, most people will opt for the choice that gives them at least a fighting shot at the latter.\nSwitching to conservative holdings in their 60s would only guarantee this group a working retirement. Maybe some are fine with the extra $400 a month in annuity payments, maybe others want to go for $800.\nWorst case scenario you lose everything and must work forever. The same thing that you were on track to do without the risk. Similarly, the old advice I mentioned above will say to start going conservative in your investments in your 60s. What if you plan to live until 95 and are hundreds of thousands of dollars behind? Is now the time to go to cash?\nOver-saving is a real trend too, on the other side of the spectrum. Some of this is the F.I.R.E folks, some is just conventional wisdom gone astray. People sacrificing their entire young adulthood in the hopes that they\u2019ll live off $100,000 a year forever is a risk itself.\nPhoto by Adi Coco on Unsplash\nThe risk is that if you die earlier than you expected, you just wasted your entire life. Hope your heir uses the money well because it\u2019d be a shame for all to go on 17 black down in Atlantic City. I tell my parents all the time that I\u2019ll gamble any inheritance in the hopes it\u2019ll encourage them to enjoy their retirement as lavishly as possible.\nOn a similar note, should the guy who\u2019s had a pint of Bacardi and two packs of Marlboros every day for 35 years be planning his funds out to 85 or 90 years of age? If he\u2019s honest with himself, he can probably get more bang for his buck on a yearly basis if he plans to a more realistic age. Then again, you never know. Depends on the person.\nGo your own way\nI\u2019m being somewhat facetious, but you get my point \u2014 different people have different needs. Based on my age, my portfolio should be way riskier than it is right now. I own a lot of utilities, gold, and defensive items. That\u2019s just what I\u2019m comfortable with at the moment. At the back end of 2020, the same portfolio was extremely heavy on volatile stocks in oil, travel/leisure, and banks. Neither decision was in line with conventional wisdom. They both worked for me.\nNext time I might not be so lucky. That\u2019s the risk I\u2019m comfortable with. Depending on my life situation, it may change. I might be less defensive next year than I am now. That\u2019s my point: there\u2019s no one right answer.\nOthers may not like the idea of fluctuating assets at all or want some income to show for them. This group may be best off avoiding the stock market altogether and going the real estate route. At least if the underlying asset loses value, it can still generate rental income. Maybe you\u2019d rather take a 10% stake in a small luxury hotel on the water and just make passive income from your silent partnership and cash infusion. Your money, your call.\nHere\u2019s the thing: our retirement system is broken. Hell, our labor market is broken. More than half the country is nowhere near where they need to be for retirement. Many will never get there. If you\u2019re in that group, do what you must. A broken system has left plenty of people with no options \u2014 those who are comfortable have no right to judge.\nIf you have a fairly conventional income, fairly conventional health, and fairly conventional goals, by all means, follow conventional wisdom. Everyone else may find a different way. I agree with the pros that your money should always be doing \u201csomething\u201d and not sitting in cash, but that doesn\u2019t mean you have to dump it all into the market or real estate.\nPeople that are fearful that they\u2019ll \u201cmiss out\u201d or those feeling a \u201cneed\u201d to catch up often make unwise investments and chase get-rich-quick schemes. Financial advice dispensed with a one-size-fits-all mentality and unrealistic goals are to blame for those feelings. Ignore them. Do your research and do what makes sense. For you. Not everyone else.", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 51, "created_time": 1649813060021, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Finance", "Personal Finance", "Investing", "Money", "Retirement"]}, {"author": "Peter Shanosky", "post_id": "3fb75cd6f148", "user_id": "e4d087f259b9", "title": "We\u2019re About to Find Out How Big Our Housing Bubble Really Is", "content": "We\u2019re About to Find Out How Big Our Housing Bubble Really Is\nAll the indicators are beginning to point in one direction\nImage by BrockenInaGlory on Wikimedia Commons. Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported\nThere has been quite the debate among industry professionals (and armchair observers) as to whether our housing market in the United States is in the midst of a bubble. Having worked in the industry for more or less my entire adult life, I\u2019ve been leaning quite heavily towards \u201cbubble\u201d in that debate. With the recent trends in sale prices and interest rates, my position has been cemented. The only question now is this: how big of a bubble?\nI don\u2019t like to be alarmist or sensationalist for no reason, though that does seem to be the key to success in writing. Still, I\u2019ve been cautious about the housing market for at least a year, and I\u2019m now downright pessimistic. Many in the industry are finally joining me in coming around to the facts of our situation.\nThe 45-year-old condos in Southwest Florida where I live represent the \u201ccheap\u201d part of town. The entry point for those looking to get into a rather lavish community overall. Still, with 9 units of 1200 square feet each to a building, it\u2019s hardly the high-end luxury that many in this area expect or \u201crequire.\u201d\nWay back in the ancient times of July 2020, those units were valued at $216,000. February of 2022? $436,000. Or, put another way, a 101.8% price increase in 18 months. It took 96 months for the last price to double, which was 2012 to 2020. Elsewhere in town, a 900-square-foot trailer built in 1979 is selling for $250,000.\nIt\u2019s hard to justify that rapid of a price increase, though some undoubtedly and good-naturedly try. We\u2019ll get into that a little later. In the meantime, home sales forecasts are finally trending down in the face of substantial increases in interest rates. There\u2019s a little bit of the barn door closing after the horse was out in those \u201cforecasts\u201d as many were made after an unexpected drop in home sales. Year-over-year mortgage demand is down 40%.\nSo the matter at hand now becomes one of severity. Will we plateau, allowing those who recently purchased homes to stay above water? Will we let the air out gently and prevent a catastrophe? Or are we due for a free-fall like we had in the late 2000s? Let\u2019s look.\nDifferent markets\nNow there are some major differences in this real estate market that make it substantially unique compared to the last crisis in 2007\u20132008. We\u2019ve underbuilt compared to demand in the last few decades, versus the overbuilding problem leading up to the bubble pop in the late 2000s. Economic growth was nearly uninterrupted for a decade or more following the great recession, and homebuyers weren\u2019t really impacted by the pandemic the way the renter class was in terms of job loss or instability.\nRecord-low interest rates spurred growth in demand. Owing to increasing disparities in wealth and income, investors gobbled up properties at a rate never seen before, exceeding 25% of purchases in some metros. In short, our market conditions are entirely different.\nI\u2019m aware that I just threw a whole garbled mess of statistics out there but they are important. Why? Because all of these facts are why many have been saying \u201cit\u2019s not a bubble \u2014 it\u2019s a boom!\u201d or \u201creal estate will never go down again \u2014 it\u2019s investors only from now on.\u201d These opinions are based on facts, just selective ones.\nPhoto by Hunters Race on Unsplash\nInvestor presence in real estate is a problem for the average American. The larger share of homes that are investor-owned, the higher the cost for the rental class. This can often inflate prices in the area overall as well. I concede all of that. Part of this is what makes me worried about a bubble.\nRight now, investors don\u2019t make up a large enough share of the real estate market to keep prices level. They just don\u2019t. We could certainly reach a point where they will, but we\u2019re not there yet. In the areas where they\u2019re most prevalent, they\u2019re about 25% of buyers. If demand dried up among the other 75%, prices would fall. None of this is revolutionary thinking.\nAs I\u2019ve discussed previously, though, the real estate market has tentacles that reach a lot of our larger economy. A precipitous fall here could have lasting damage for many nationwide. Falling prices would leave some homeowners underwater, while the ensuing recession could cause harm to purchasing power for those who weren\u2019t directly impacted by the original price drop.\nThe result would be a lot of cheaper homes and only a few remaining buyers \u2014 investors. It\u2019s at this point that I could see the doomsday-type predictions gain some ground. When investors start to represent 33%, or 40%, etc. of the buyers on the market, they may be able to corner that same market. Now we\u2019d have real problems.\nBut for now, they\u2019re not enough to sustain prices at these levels. We\u2019ve seen this already. Investors are still plugging away, buying new properties, flipping properties back and forth to each other, and all the other fun activities they do on a day-to-day basis.\nDespite all this, prices are starting to fall. More sellers are lowering prices, and the rate at which that\u2019s been occurring has increased consistently since August of last year. With mortgage rates only recently seeing any major increase, we\u2019re yet to see the bulk of their effects. Right now, the air has been let out ever so slightly. Will it continue?\nArtificial demand is artificial\nThe other argument for a housing boom versus a bubble is on the old supply-demand seesaw. Housing prices wouldn\u2019t be rising if there wasn\u2019t such a demand for them, right?\nThat\u2019s correct. Low interest rates spurred demand, and in a big way. With that heightened demand, it became evident our supply was lacking. Tada, you have an economic event. Low supply, high demand, prices rise. Community college professors across the nation have had wonderful examples for their 100-level ECON classes.\nNot all demand is the same, however. Interest rates lowered in the face of a global pandemic and an anticipated economic catastrophe are not a part of normal market conditions. They were artificially low, creating an artificial demand among buyers who wouldn\u2019t normally be in the market for a home. As soon as the larger climate that created the demand dissipates, so too does the demand itself.\nThis is evidenced by the 40% drop in demand year-over-year in the face of rising home prices in conjunction with larger interest rates. Our so-called boom was not based upon tremendous salary and wage growth lifting a section of our society into the homeownership class. None of that has happened. Our salaries and wages are still stagnant, or, in the face of 7% inflation, declining on a real basis.\nPhoto by Breno Assis on Unsplash\nAs a result, with mortgage rates climbing at a faster pace than even industry experts were expecting, we can expect to see the demand side of the seesaw collapse. We\u2019re already seeing it. The question is where the bottom is. We\u2019ll use some medians to enlighten us.\nThe median home sales price in March 2022 was $405,000. Interest rates are up to 4.72% now. Your median buyer (as someone who works with them daily) puts down about 10% and pays private mortgage insurance. Put all those things together and you have a median mortgage of $2,602 monthly. Not cheap, I\u2019ll say that much.\nUsing the old adage that says housing should be no more than 30% of your gross monthly income, we would need a gross monthly income of $8,673 to support that payment. Only 32% of households meet that threshold in the United States, currently. Considering many of them are likely already in a home and not shopping, that\u2019s not enough buyers to keep that demand high.\nWe\u2019re seeing this in the demand figures, price adjustments, and estimated values. Zillow and the like should be taken with a grain of salt, of course \u2014 they\u2019re accurate in the same sense a personality test is accurate. Very general and useful for broad analysis, but blind to the unique factors surrounding a home\u2019s value. Still, from February to the present 2022, we\u2019ve seen a drop (correction) of about 5%. The market is running out of steam.\nThe outcome\nAll these economic indicators are currently pointing in one direction. What that means long-term is up for debate. Should we welcome the development as one that could promote longer-term affordability? Should be fearful that this will allow investors to get a larger and larger share of the market? Or concerned for the owners who bought at the top of the market?\nEach of those has its own separate set of concerns. Still, a price correction could bring us closer to reality without having severe ramifications. A price correction in the near term could also keep demand at healthy enough levels to stave off a downturn in real estate and related industries that could spread to the larger economy.\nIn short, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll see a total collapse, but further correction is required. Until at least a plurality of Americans can afford the median home, prices will need to adjust down. From now until then, buyer beware \u2014 those who bought at the top of the market in 2006 and 2007 had some horror stories to share.

Staying too long in a bad relationship? Letting go of a great one? Poor work or financial choices?\nOr spending too much time agonising over friends and being liked, your body, your looks, your weight?\nRegret is widely touted as one of the most common negative emotions \u2014 and my clinical observation backs that up. Most people have regrets: they long to turn back time, wish certain aspects of life had gone differently \u2014 or ponder \u201cwhat might have been\u201d.\nWhile re-reading palliative care nurse Bronnie Ware\u2019s The Top 5 Regrets of the Dying I began to wonder what people most regret in middle age \u2014 supposedly when they still have time to do something about it.\nSo I carried out a survey\u2026\nOver the next month I surveyed clients and friends \u2014 anyone I bumped into \u2014 aged 35\u201360 years: around 50 people. There were no control groups and no rules \u2014 just a single question: what\u2019s your biggest regret?\nI expected the usual: not spending enough time with loved ones, taking the wrong career path, regrets about money (spending it unwisely or not saving it), regrets around use of time, hurting others or behaving badly.\nI got some of that. But I was surprised by the number of big, thorny regrets that that had clung to people, in some cases shaped their lives and could still make them cry \u2014 and huge doses of self-blame.\nHere\u2019s what they said.\nThe Top 8 Regrets of Middle Age\n1. Not doing the \u201cright\u201d thing when someone died.\nRegrets related to death cut the deepest. They included not being there for someone close to them when they died; not being able to prevent a friend\u2019s suicide, having a fight with dad just before he died in a car crash.\nSeveral people wished they\u2019d tried harder to improve or \u201cfix\u201d a relationship while they still had a chance. Or spent more time with someone they loved. Those regrets stayed close to the surface, were still upsetting. It had made them more conscious of their close relationships, of nurturing those that mattered.\n2. Spending too much time worrying and being afraid.\nPeople regretted hiding from their feelings (or burying them), not speaking up for their own needs and desires, trying too hard to please others \u2014 or backing away from opportunities they could have taken. Fear, or a \u201clack of confidence\u201d, had led to regret around things they had NOT done, like taking risks, trying different things, dating more people, pursuing less popular career paths and traveling.\n3. Not having enough adventure (staying in the comfort zone).\nClinging to security; playing it \u201csafe\u201d. Taking few risks with their lives and now feeling the weight of responsibility \u2014 kids, partners, mortgages, ageing parents, debt, work pressure \u2014 that it was too late.\n4. Staying too long in a bad situation (work/relationships).\nOver-staying in a job they hated or were bored with, or clinging to an unsatisfactory (even toxic) relationship was common. So was loving the wrong person \u2014 and then having their heart broken by them.\n5. Not being smarter with money.\nThis was almost everyone, in some way or another. Even those who seemed to have plenty had regrets about how they\u2019d used it \u2014 or purchases they should have made, like property. Perhaps evidence that, beyond personal grief, money worries us the most.\n6. Not getting more education (or choosing the wrong path).\nWishing they\u2019d had the determination to study more or the courage to do what was in their heart. In all cases this was because they didn\u2019t like the path they were on now \u2014 but didn\u2019t know how (or felt it was too risky) to change it.\n7. Lost opportunities.\nThese regrets were often pegged to things beyond their control. Like being unable to have a child. Not finding a loving life partner. Being rejected by the person they loved. Or throwing away a great relationship. Several expressed their regret in marrying/having a family too young and not fulfilling their work/career aspirations.\n8. Doing stupid or mean things.\nHurting others (lovers, friends and parents), abuse of alcohol and drugs, too much sex with the wrong people. One person admitted being a bully. Others referred to being too self-focused. Or dumb. Or naive. Or inexperienced. Or avoidant. Or unable to apologise. Things that can still make us cringe. Things we should all be better at in middle age. But are not always.\nWhat\u2019s Your Greatest Regret?\nRegret can be useful. It makes us aware of the mistakes we\u2019ve made; the not-so-great ways we\u2019ve treated others or ourselves. And, if we allow it, it can help guide our future choices.\nBut it can also keep our focus on things we\u2019ve \u201cfailed\u201d to do, rather than all that we have done \u2014 and could still do. While the past informs who we are, it\u2019s not possible to live fully while looking over our shoulders.\nWhat\u2019s your greatest regret?\nIf it can\u2019t be changed, maybe it\u2019s time to loosen your grip on it.

But it\u2019s often hard to see a way forward because love is so messy. There are so many emotions attached to, and threaded through, it.\nWhen you\u2019ve been with someone for a while it can be hard to know what lies within the range of \u201cnormal, acceptable\u201d behaviour. This is frequently because \u201cunacceptable\u201d creeps in slowly, so it\u2019s hard to know when it\u2019s crossed the line.\nBut you need to. And the only way to spot a crossed line is to draw lines in the first place.\nAre we healthy \u2014 or not?\nThe difficulty is there are no absolutes in relationships. There\u2019s no blueprint for love. Okay and \u201cnormal-ish\u201d vary hugely. The divorce zone for one couple may be just another dance around the kitchen bench for another.\nThe best starting point is to figure out what feelings your relationship (or being with your partner) is stirring up in you; then to consider which of these are healthy \u2014 and which are absolutely not.\nBeing with someone, especially over time, can be a challenge. Unless you are saintly, your feelings for your partner will not remain pure. But at its core, your relationship shouldn\u2019t make you feel bad.\nWhich means it shouldn\u2019t do any of these things to you.\nIt shouldn\u2019t make you anxious.\nAnxiety, a little insecurity, is normal in new relationships, when you\u2019re trying to figure out \u201cwhat this is\u201d. It\u2019s particularly common when you\u2019ve been hurt and you\u2019re worried about exposing yourself (and your heart) to further wounding. But continual, rumbling anxiety because you\u2019re not-quite-sure-of-the-one-you\u2019re-with? That\u2019s wrong. If that\u2019s happening, read the room.\nIt shouldn\u2019t make you tiptoe around your own freaking house.\nWhen you\u2019re creeping around your house it\u2019s because you\u2019re unsure of your partner\u2019s bad/unpredictable moods, or you\u2019re scared of throwing the switch that will send them into one. Unless your partner is an exhausted shift worker who needs to sleep during daylight hours, you should be able to walk around your house, talking at normal volume, and doing your thing without worrying about winding them up \u2014 and having them take it out on you. But you already knew that, right?\nIt shouldn\u2019t cut you off from your friends.\nIsolation lurks in the shadows of all toxic relationships. A toxic partner will play divide and rule tactics, gradually splitting you off from your support system so that when they really start to play up you\u2019ll have nowhere to run. A good partner will encourage you to be with your people \u2014 as long as your people are good to you.\nIt shouldn\u2019t make you defend it.\nThis can be challenging if, for example, your parents don\u2019t like your partner or the other way around. You can find yourself justifying your choice, when \u2014 if you truly love this person \u2014 you shouldn\u2019t have to. The trick is to keep your eyes wide open. Beware of justifying your partner\u2019s bad behaviour just to keep them in favour with your friends or family \u2014 or to stop them from criticising your choice. And know that when you\u2019ve moved your relationship into the secret zone, you\u2019re on shaky ground.\nIt shouldn\u2019t make you question your sanity.\nGaslighting. Oh no. This is the hallmark of many toxic relationships. When your partner causes you to first of all question your reality: Did that really happen? Did I exaggerate or imagine it?\nThen, to wonder, just slightly, if you are really losing it? If you are worried about this, get a trusted outside opinion because, if you\u2019ve been with a toxic partner for any length of time, you will have mastered the art of second-guessing yourself. They will have made sure of it.\nIt shouldn\u2019t highlight your vulnerabilities.\nIf you feel vulnerable about your body, your partner shouldn\u2019t turn the spotlight on it. I had a client once whose wife hated his nose. She had happily married him when he had this same nose. But, a few years in, she found this nose bothered her immensely (I assume) and raised it frequently, which had made him highly self-conscious about his looks and his attractiveness to her.\nIt\u2019s likely there was something else going on for her \u2014 and between them \u2014 but it was hard on him. Unless she was going to pay for nasal surgery AND he wanted it \u2014 she shouldn\u2019t comment. Especially not often. That\u2019s just mean.\nIt shouldn\u2019t change your personality.\nLook, if you have really dodgy taste in clothes, your partner is allowed to go to work on that. Socks and sandals? That triple denim ensemble you love to roll out? Sorry. Superficial change in the outfit department is sometimes more than necessary.\nWhen you\u2019re with someone for a long time, your personality morphs a little into theirs. It\u2019s called \u201cadapting.\u201d But your personality \u2014 who you are at your core \u2014 should not be altered. If anything, your finer points should be, more than ever, gloriously on display.\nYou are who you are. Your partner should enjoy \u2014 and hopefully celebrate \u2014 that.\nThanks for reading!

The debut novelist who scored a 7-figure advance. The dancer who\u2019s smashing it on TikTok. The 16-year-old who started a world-wide charity. The rookie draft pick who became a millionaire overnight.\nOccasionally those stories are inspiring. But often they\u2019re a bit depressing, especially if you\u2019ve been toiling at your craft/job for years with not much to show for it.\nBut here\u2019s the thing. Fame and fortune don\u2019t guarantee happiness. Nor does relentless self-promotion. Nor does having a gazillion social media followers or seeing tweets go viral.\nThose achievements won\u2019t win you (genuine) friends or sort out arguments with your partner. They won\u2019t insulate you from stress or nurture your physical and mental health. They won\u2019t ensure you are loved.\nThey might just make everything worse. (See multiple celebrity stories for details).\nIf Fame is Your Aim, Read This\nThere\u2019s no shame in wanting to make the most of yourself and your life. But if fame is your aim, you need to back up the truck. Because \u2014 even if you get there \u2014 it will leave you feeling empty.\nQuiet achievement is not about locking yourself in a dark room and working all the hours you\u2019re given. It\u2019s not about studiously avoiding all human contact and just doing your thing.\nIt\u2019s about knowing what you like to do and steadily, methodically, trying to do it better. Trying to get better.\nAnd it\u2019s about creating a life you are proud of because, then, if all your quiet toil leads to nothing much then it won\u2019t matter in the broader scheme of your life.\nThere\u2019s no blueprint for achievement. But those who do it quietly tend to share some key habits. These are the best of them.\n1. They show, not boast.\nAggressive self-promotion is not for them. They don\u2019t care if you have no idea what they do as long as they get to do it. They\u2019ll show you, rather than tell you. In other words, they just do their best work and let it do the talking.\n2. They\u2019re okay with being average.\nThey\u2019re more than okay with being average, they relish it. Because they know that being average gives you space to grow, a lot of room to improve and the freedom to do it out of the spotlight \u2014 without being touted as \u201cone to watch\u201d.\nThey know that being average lowers the bar; it gives you the best excuse to ask dumb questions and mess up. And they know that in the apex where average meets persistence, great things are born.\n3. They take their time.\nWith their work. With their creative projects. With their relationships. With their weekends. When they\u2019re with people who matter to them. They see the hustle for what it is \u2014 superficial and exhausting. They don\u2019t beat themselves up for taking a detour. They know that life is longer than most people think. So they don\u2019t rush, they pace themselves.\n4. They\u2019re looking from a different angle.\nThey don\u2019t see things as they are, or as everyone else sees them. Instead, they step to one side and look again. It allows them to see things from a fresh angle and perspective. It means they can steal bits and pieces from all sorts of odd places to add to their quietly growing knowledge. And that puts them ahead of the game.\n5. They celebrate their achievements under the radar.\nQuiet achievers know the value of acknowledging their wins. They don\u2019t just let them pass. They break out the bubbles when appropriate. But they\u2019re not shouting it through megaphones, they\u2019re not looking for claps. They don\u2019t live and die by the growth of their email list. They\u2019re just enjoying their achievements, then they\u2019re going back to work.\n6. They don\u2019t get lost on Easy Street.\nAh Easy Stress. Everyone loves Easy Street. And everyone should spend some time on Easy Street. That\u2019s where all the fun stuff is. The parties. The toys. The temptations. The scrolling. The time-wasters. The trouble.\nBut quiet achievers keep tabs on the time they spend on Easy Street. They run the GPS on themselves; they never get lost down there because they know the price tag is too high. They know it can become really, really hard to get back.\n7. They\u2019re more tortoise than hare.\nQuiet achievers show up. They\u2019re consistent. They know takes time to get really good at anything. They also know that most people don\u2019t develop their talent fully because they aren\u2019t willing to spend much time at all. Most want the fastest route and if they don\u2019t see immediate progress they give up. They shy away from pain and rejection, instead of trying to grow from it.\nQuiet achievers take calculated risks, never dangerous ones. They get their thrills from subtle places. They keep the Aesop\u2019s fable philosophy in mind: Slow and steady wins the race. So when the hares bolt and tire, they\u2019re content with plodding forward.\nBecause they know the truth: That life is not a race. It\u2019s a road trip. And taking the trip slowly means you just might enjoy it.\nThanks for reading!

They leave too much carnage behind them to be able to claim that. I mean, they\u2019re good \u2014 very good \u2014 at what they do.\nIn my therapy practice, I don\u2019t see many narcissists. That\u2019s because people with highly-developed narcissistic traits don\u2019t tend to sign up for therapy. Because they\u2019re not the problem, right? Everyone else is.\nBut I do see many people who\u2019ve been hurt by narcissists. Many who\u2019ve had their honest, well-intentioned efforts at love sideswiped by someone who is better than them.\nNot better at loving \u2014 but better at the game.\nThey know how to play. They know who to look for.\nLet\u2019s take a closer look.\nAre You a Target?\nThis is a hard thing to stare down, and challenging to absorb.\nNo-one wants to think they were \u201ctargeted\u201d by someone in their relationship. No-one wants to think their personality \u2014 who they are \u2014 set them up for misery in love.\nWe all want to think someone fell for us \u2014 hard. We all want the love story.\nBut it\u2019s easier to take when you understand it\u2019s not weakness that a narcissist is attracted to \u2014 it\u2019s goodness.\nClinically speaking, Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD) is a mental health condition, characterised by an extreme self-focus coupled with the inability to consider the feelings of others.\nNarcissism is one of the classified personality disorders. Experts say around 5% of the population meet the criteria for NPD. However, it\u2019s likely that many more exhibit a range of these traits, to a greater or lesser extent.\nNarcissist traits of the more extreme kind have obvious implications for relationships. Their self-focus and lack of empathy, in particular, lead them to approach love less as an emotional state, and more as a project.\nSo they\u2019ll look for people who can serve their needs, or who can enhance their life, not the other way around. In other words, their relationships are always a one-way ticket, even if they\u2019re not consciously aware of it.\nBased on my clinical experience, here are the characteristics most likely to make a person attractive to a narcissist. While every relationship has its unique markers, anyone who\u2019s been with a narcissistic partner will find some traits that resonate.\n10 Traits Narcissists Quietly Seek in a Person\n* You\u2019re empathetic.\nOften hugely so. Listening and soothing are your middle names. Yours is a shoulder people cry on. Narcissists want someone who will soak up all their feelings, that will be a cushion for their struggles, that will keep supporting them, even when there\u2019s little-to-nothing in return.\n* You\u2019re trusting.\nYou inherently believe people should be trusted. So you cut your partner slack for their suspicious behaviours and misdemeanours, over and over again. Even they are surprised by how forgiving you are \u2014 not that they\u2019ll tell you this.\n* You\u2019re responsible.\nOften excessively responsible, even for things outside your control. You\u2019re up for taking the blame even when there\u2019s (absolutely) no way you should. This is often a trait you developed early in life. And you keep taking responsibility for others \u2014 for their mistakes, for their choices, for their lives.\n* You\u2019re a people-pleaser.\nOn some level, you like to please, to keep everyone happy. You feel better when everyone\u2019s in a good space. You may find it hard to admit this but you need \u2014 love, appreciation or acceptance \u2014 the validation that the narcissist gives you (a) in the love-bombing stage and (b) from then on, whenever they feel like it.\n* You\u2019re honest.\nYou\u2019re truthful when your narcissist partner is habitually dishonest, so much so that they get tripped up by their own lies. Sadly, your honesty \u2014 and the fact that dishonesty is barely on your radar \u2014 makes you a narcissists\u2019 dream.\n* You enhance their status.\nYou\u2019re chosen because you\u2019re one or more of the following: Physically attractive, wealthy, successful, famous, intelligent/highly educated. Being with you enhances their status. But hear this. You enhance their status \u2014 but you DO NOT overshadow them. Or else.\n* You have loose boundaries.\nTo be fair, anyone who is with a narcissist has their boundaries tested because they\u2019ll never respect them. It\u2019s part of the game to keep you guessing. But people who are inexperienced in relationships or unskilled in setting and keeping boundaries are just what the narcissist ordered. Because it makes the game even more fun \u2014 for them.\n* You want to help/rescue.\nPeople often stay longer in toxic relationships because they truly want to help their partner. You truly believe you are the one to rescue this person with such a traumatic past, to help them heal, to trust and love again. And you keep on believing it, and striving to help them, even as your own health and wellbeing starts to suffer.\nYou see the best in people.\nIt\u2019s a wonderful trait and that\u2019s what keeps you there. You stay focused on your partner\u2019s good points, even when evidence for the dark side keeps racking up.\nYou\u2019ve had contact with a narcissist previously.\nNot always, but often a person who partners with a narcissist will have experienced a relationship of this sort before \u2014 perhaps by a parent, sibling or previous partner. Something about the chaos or the devaluing is familiar to you, even if it\u2019s on a subconscious level. And while you may know it\u2019s not \u201cnormal\u201d the familiarity comforts in that you understand how it works.\nIs it a Yes From You?\nPerhaps you read this and found yourself nodding to a few of these traits? If so, take heart. People who\u2019ve been in such relationships are often hugely self-critical \u2014 believing they are flawed for not clocking the red flags or staying too long.\nIt\u2019s time to let all that go. Narcissists are very, very good at what they do. It\u2019s your goodness, your value, that drew them in. They only want the best for themselves, after all.\nInterested in relationships.

I missed and he pushed me down and I fell and then I was saved by other losers who pulled me away and only when I was safely in their arms did I really start cussing him out.\nThis happened so long ago. I don\u2019t think the woman was someone I was dating, just another barfly I was quasi-successfully chatting up, which was a rarity. I can still see her horrified face when I turned and lunged at the dude who saw me coming and I can see his face, too, and he was laughing. I can only assume I looked like an adult who was not in control of his emotions. Which is upsetting to some people, and absolutely hilarious to others.\nIn the seconds between his insult and my attack, I was visited by my ancestors, generations of macho loudmouth boozers who solved problems with their meat hooks, hurt the ones they loved and died, young, clutching their hearts and wishing they hadn\u2019t wasted so much time being afraid of their feelings. These specters all encouraged me to defend the honor of this woman, who would disappear during the melee, never to return to that dive. She turned out to be the smartest person there. I don\u2019t even think she saw me lose the incredibly brief fracas.\nThe long-dead princes of testosterone chanted \u201cact like a man\u201d over and over and I acted like a man, which is to say, after I got kicked out of my local I probably stumbled home crying.\nI think the guy said something about her size? Maybe? Or did he call me fat? Did I even care about her? Again, I haven't thought about this in years and I wish I could say it was the least embarrassing thing I ever did soused but that would be a lie.\nI\u2019m thinking about all this because, last night, during a fancy awards show on live TV, a famous dude told a hacky joke about another famous dude\u2019s wife, and that famous dude walked up to the comedian on the stage and slapped him in front of millions before returning to his seat and cursing. Later, the celebrity who slapped the other celebrity won his first big shiny award ever, and sniveled and babbled and apologized \u2014 but not really \u2014 while happily accepting his trophy. The dude has been famous his whole life and now he\u2019s infamous, too. Congratulations.\nIt was quite the spectacle. For a moment, everyone forgot the wars and the plague and our slowly dying planet. Like drunks at a bar, we couldn\u2019t help but gasp and point and judge these two dudes. I was not above it. The conversation online was lacking in nuance, which should not come as a surprise, and the reactions can be divided into two main camps: one celebrity is an abusive psychopath, and the other is an inconsiderate jackass who had it coming. I don\u2019t want to pick a side but why can\u2019t it be a little bit of both and also a little bit of \u201ccelebrities are lunatics.\u201d\nI\u2019d like to note that the slapper is a superb actor and the slappee is one of the great stand-ups. It\u2019s a bummer this trashy sideshow is part of their career histories.\nHere\u2019s a prediction: future historians will write that American-style celebrity in the 20th Century and early 21st was a psychologically deforming experience that crushed a beautiful few under impossible amounts of pressure and applause and praise and no amount of money or luxury is worth being paraded around and cheered and fattened like some painted sacrifice\nIt\u2019s crazy-making and probably more so if you were a little fragile, to begin with, not to mention the entire \u201cacting\u201d profession is one where, if you get really successful at it, can cause you to confuse your mask and your face.\nCelebrities are like living mini-economies and in their orbits are dozens and dozens of people who make a good living working for them. So I\u2019m certain trusted advisors are whispering sweet nothings into the ears of both of these well-known men, and plans are being hatched in order to manage this public relations crisis.\nSo as an openhearted favor, I will be embarrassed for both of them. They both, honestly, should ask for forgiveness, whether or not anyone is in the mood to give it. It\u2019s good for the soul. Even the guy who took the slap. It wouldn\u2019t kill him to tell the celebrity\u2019s wife, who is herself a pretty rad celebrity, that he\u2019s sorry for making a joke about her hair, he didn\u2019t know she lives with an autoimmune condition, etc, etc.\nI have compassion for both these men. I do. I have said thoughtless things that I thought were funny but were, actually, hurtful. And I have been a guy utterly overwhelmed by anger, unmoored by emotions I can\u2019t understand in the moment. I can\u2019t relate to being rich and powerful and famous but I can definitely relate to being stupid and I don\u2019t know any other word for it. It takes intelligence and courage to use your words to communicate what is going on in your heart and head. If \u201cstupid\u201d is too crude then I can relate to not stopping and thinking. I can relate to being a coward.\nAnd there definitely are times when being angry is appropriate but slapping someone like a mad king because they told a joke that made you feel things you didn\u2019t like feeling \u2014 shame, hate, horror, sadness, fear \u2014 is inappropriate. But everyone knows this. C\u2019mon.\nI also read posts on social media from both men and women who celebrated a man defending his woman. I am also sympathetic to this idea. It\u2019s a crap idea but it\u2019s romantic in a deeply childish and superficial way. When I did it, of course, I was just reacting, like a donkey kicking its hind legs because it was threatened. I\u2019m sure I thought I was defending a woman I desperately wanted to make out with but I was mostly showing off? I was also defending my own self-esteem, which is pathetic?\nBut the idea. The idea. I get it.\nA man defends the weak, right? He fights for those who ask for help. He sticks up for his friends and family. Yes. Absolutely. A person should stand by those they love. A person should show concern for those in need. These are all virtues but modern masculinity is a simplistic violence-based philosophy handed down over generations that frees men from having to take responsibility for their words, actions, and feelings and replaces those basic human duties with an unerring faith in brute force. It is an easy one-skillet recipe for life and it is an unhappy way to live.\nWhat does \u201cdefend a woman\u2019s honor\u201d even mean? Isn\u2019t that an ancient sentiment from the good ol\u2019 days of chivalry when women were basically furniture? They were extensions of their husbands and if they were mocked then that meant the man was being mocked and then, like, huzzah fight me, or some shit? My point is: honor is another word for a man\u2019s engorged ego.\nAs a drunk, I\u2019ve lost two fights and one of them was to a wall. So I\u2019m a little bit of an expert when it comes to sloppy men behaving sloppily. The slapper needs someone in his life to tell him he was wrong. That\u2019s the truth but that won\u2019t happen. The slappee needs some better jokes.\nSpring/NYC/2022\nThoughts on a new season\u2026medium.com", "comment_count": 25, "like_count": 1676, "created_time": 1648496548789, "comment": [{"user_id": "106803413c5d", "comment_time": 1648496548789, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "7c572fa4c182", "comment_time": 1648525916539, "comment": "Yeah, I'm on the fence about this one too.

The idea that canines, like wolves, fight each other in a pack and the winner is the leader who gets to eat what they want and mate with who they want has been widely debunked.\nThe scientist who came up with the alpha dog theory observed wolves in captivity and it turns out that wolves in the wild are actually highly cooperative.\nBut there are red-blooded All-American heterosexual cisgender men who have built their entire identities on the widely refuted thesis that dogs observe an aggression-based social hierarchy. These dudes think of themselves as \u201calpha dogs\u201d who dominate other dudes, or \u201cbetas.\u201d\nIt is a fantasy, a kind of role-playing game. And in this game, Pulitzer-prize-winning playwright David Mamet, one of the most celebrated chroniclers of modern masculinity, is very much a beta dog barking for the approval of loud men and bullies and theatrical tough guys like former President Trump.\nHe is a born-again conservative whose newest book, Recessional: The Death of Free Speech and the Cost of a Free Lunch, is a collection of anti-liberal essays written for the kinds of anti-mask MAGA junkies who want to nationalize social media businesses and chase the entire LGBTQ community back into the closet.\nFor decades, he has written plays and screenplays about cops and robbers, hired guns, and charming conmen, the kinds of alpha dogs old-fashioned Republican dads want to be but aren\u2019t.\nHis characters are mostly men who do not smile and, yet, are irresistible to much younger women. They are violent if they have to be. These are men of few words, but those words are witty and cutting, and sometimes fruity. It\u2019s a conservative world of top dogs and losers and in between, dudes like Mamet, Willy Lomans who want to be well-liked by the powerful and the rich and the famous.\nAnd speaking of fame: Mamet was on Fox News recently promoting his tome and the revival of one of his plays on Broadway.\nInterviewed by Mark Levin, Mamet was in rare form. At one point, he declared that \u201cteachers are inclined, particularly men because men are predators, to pedophilia\u201d during a conversation about Florida\u2019s controversial \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay\u201d legislation, one of many bills across the country aimed at banning discussions of sexuality or gender in public schools.\nMamet\u2019s provocative statement isn\u2019t original, of course. The wording may be his but there are dozens of Republican politicians and think tank apparatchiks and transphobic social media trolls and, yes, cable news anchors who are all chanting the same party message: the LGBTQ community and its allies are all pedophiles.\nThe Republican mid-term election strategy has been to dial up the hate and prejudice and teachers are one of their targets and if you disagree you are, that\u2019s right, a pedophile. It\u2019s not an elegant argument but it is proving effective, especially amongst senior citizens like Mamet.\nHis appearance on Levin\u2019s show was a sweaty sales pitch to the only wolfpack interested in a collection of Pro-Trump screeds and luckily Mamet knows how to pander. He is a showbiz bigwig after all.\nLike Fox\u2019s audience, Mamet believes a host of confused, even paranoid, conspiracies all of which boil down to \u201cliberals are destroying America.\u201d He is oppressed, silenced, and he has said as much on Bill Maher\u2019s HBO show, on Joe Rogan\u2019s podcast, and in The Wall Street Journal.\nHe\u2019s a courageous truth-teller, you see, and the truths he tells are indistinguishable from what\u2019s loaded into the teleprompters of Fox News\u2019 primetime shows: the election was rigged, COVID is a hoax, Putin is a friend, Trump is a hero. Blah blah blah.\nMamet is still the poet laureate of macho bullshit but he\u2019s also a political simp now, a shameless partisan suck-up sniffing the butts of other terrified straight white men with grey hair and money.\nI was once a fan of David Mamet and his recent right-wing statements and lectures and whiny complaints about \u201cliberals\u201d are both enraging and deeply disappointing. Has he always been this unimaginative? Once upon a time, I thought he was an intellectual and an artist and I guess I was wrong?\nI did not have the physical prowess to become a football player in high school or the confidence to start a band or the brains to join the chess club so I became a playwright, which meant I got to spend a lot of time with misfits and some of them were members of the opposite sex\nI figured if I couldn\u2019t be a quarterback or a rock star I could settle for the next best thing, which was watching other people say your lines while you sit in the dark.\nI discovered Mamet's plays the same year I listened to Guns N Roses\u2019 Appetite for Destruction, the hard rock album that went platinum 18 times.\nBoth Mamet and Guns and Roses represented high-water marks in misogynist pop culture and both blew my adolescent mind because they were almost joyously profane. Up until Appetite for Destruction, MTV rock bands were hairless, horny dudes in spandex, and wigs singing silly songs with squealing guitars about talkin\u2019 dirty and then Guns N Roses comes along and screams about sex and drugs, cursing the whole time.\nI remember reading Glengarry Glen Ross one afternoon at the public library and while Mamet\u2019s critique of greed and capitalism went over my head, his use of the words \u201cfuck\u201d and \u201ccunt\u201d made an impression. I did not know you could do that in a play. It felt more rock and roll than Guns \u2018N Roses, the rock and roll band.\nFrom that moment on I was a fan of Mamet, macho playwright. A few months after reading Glengarry Glen Ross I wrote a one-act play full of f-words and my English teacher at the time, a gentle former hippie, cringed but encouraged me anyway.\nYears later, I was kicked out of my university\u2019s theatre program during my fourth year because I was a sloppy young alcoholic but I told people it was because I was too dangerous. A truth-teller, you see.\nI would graduate but while I waited for that to happen I co-created a theater company in Richmond, Virginia with a few compatriots and I wrote a play and also co-produced Mamet\u2019s naughty 1974 play Sexual Perversity In Chicago, a look at modern relationships that takes place in a version of the Windy City where only white heterosexuals exist. We performed these two shows in a bar.\nThe play I wrote was about a sad woman literally haunted by the ghost of her brother and I\u2019d immediately keel over if I were to reread it because I know for a fact it makes no sense but there were plenty of swear words because that\u2019s what Mamet would have wanted. The brother is the villain but he gets all the meanest, filthiest zingers.\nWhile that play was rehearsing I found time to write another play (thank you, cocaine) inspired by Mamet\u2019s two-hander Oleanna, an anti-#MeToo play written 28 years before the movement, about a college professor and a student accusing him of sexual harassment that ends in violence, which was shocking at the time and may still be but I have no interest in rereading it.\nMy version was a more autobiographical confrontation between a biracial student and a university admissions pencil pusher who wants him to deny his dueling ethnicities and to admit he\u2019s simply white. That play is lost to time and I suppose I should be thankful for that.\nI have always made sure to see movies that Mamet either wrote or wrote under a pseudonym or wrote and directed. His 1987 screenplay for Brian DePalma\u2019s g-men versus gangsters Tommy gun opera The Untouchables? Flawless.\nThe 90s thriller Ronin was written by J.D. Zeik and Richard Weisz, which is one of Mamet\u2019s pen names. That movie, about freelance spies hunting down a special suitcase, stars Robert DeNiro in one of his last great he-man roles, and its chock full of Mametese: sinister one-liners and staccato repartee.\nIt might be that he\u2019s a better screenwriter than a playwright because the movie version of Glengarry Glen Ross includes his most famous piece of writing, arguably. This scene is not included in the play, to the play's detriment: as a super-salesman sent downtown to smack around a room full of sadsack real estate hustlers, Alec Baldwin gives an ultimatum, which is basically \u201csell or GTFO.\u201d\nHe is there to scare these agents into making money and he does it by emasculating them. If they can\u2019t take it, they can hit the bricks. Baldwin\u2019s character is a conservative archetype, the Ayn Randian commando who is rich because he is talented. I should have seen Baldwin\u2019s cruel swashbuckling executive as the ridiculous cartoon he is but I was a young man and young men are always easily impressed by powerful older men in suits, even make-believe ones.\nI was such a fan of Mamet that I went to see his movie The Edge in the theaters, which also stars Alec Baldwin and Anthony Hopkins. In that one, a bookworm billionaire and the dashing young photographer shtupping his younger wife find themselves in the middle of the Alaskan wilderness, fighting a bear. It is thrilling and at the same time, you get the impression David Mamet has never really been outside.\nAs a director, Mamet\u2019s camera is uninspired and his actors are told to just say their lines and because of that, the movies he directs and writes are painfully dull except for a few stunners, like his 1987 debut House of Games and 2001\u2019s Heist with Gene Hackman, a tense, clever who-is-fucking-over-who crime thriller.\nI wasn\u2019t kidding when I wrote that I was once a fan, I guess I sort of always will be, kinda.\nMamet adores the idea of strength and smarts and willpower. His calloused characters are the projections of a nerd, though, and that\u2019s what playwrights are, socially-awkward dorks who spend most of their time alone, talking to themselves when they\u2019re not lurking in the back of a theater watching beautiful actors speak their words.\nHis entire body of work is about men, alphas, and Mamet is clearly not an alpha. To read or watch Mamet\u2019s dramas is to behold a scientist studying a subject from far away and his subject is men who are forced, or who choose, to behave like animals.\nI don\u2019t know if he\u2019s truly ever challenged himself creatively. His play Boston Marriage maybe? That is a period comedy about lesbians and I can\u2019t think of another topic white straught men are more obsessed with than lesbians.\nMamet\u2019s press tour will end soon, and be forgotten. The 73-year-old still has some fight in him but I\u2019ve given up on any late-career growth: he\u2019s a comfortable old man holding on to the old ways. He\u2019s a warning to us all.\nBut, increasingly, I have to admit to myself that Mamet probably didn't transform from one of the American theater\u2019s enfants terribles into a wealthy reactionary crank overnight. He was always trending that way and the clues were there in his work and I just didn\u2019t see them.\nWhat\u2019s more likely is that I have changed, over the years, especially my relationship with my gender identity. I don\u2019t cling to daydreams of John Wayne and Magnum P.I. The masculinity that Mamet documented is a social script, a sort of a wink or a handshake that indicates membership in a not-so-secret society, and to be a white heterosexual man is to be born with either immense privilege or, at least, more potential than other people. It\u2019s quite a club.\nMamet's lurch rightward isn\u2019t a surprise. He has been leaning that way since at least 2008, but I wanted to believe he was just a tax-hating, stars-and-stripes loving soft-boiled libertarian which isn\u2019t great but it isn\u2019t going on Fox News and spewing bigoted bullshit.\nMy bad.\nThe truth is, I\u2019ll always be drawn to his plays and movies. I rewatched The Spanish Prisoner last month featuring one of Steve Martin\u2019s weirdest performances. I didn\u2019t like it but it didn\u2019t waste my time if that makes sense.\nI thought about checking out the new restaging of his grifter melodrama American Buffalo starring Lawrence Fishburne on the Great White Way. But I don\u2019t want to directly support him right now. Or do I? I won\u2019t commit to seeing it or not seeing it. Sorry. I don\u2019t know. Dammit, Mamet, you could have written Ronin 2 instead of a slim volume of Fox News-friendly manifestos. At least I would have bought a ticket to the former.

For over a century physicists have speculated that there are infinite realities that resemble ours but differ in subtle, and dramatic ways. This idea isn\u2019t even new to pop culture: 55-years-ago Captain Kirk met an evil goateed Spock from a parallel dimension. The 2009 big-screen Star Trek reboot was built on the idea of different universes that were similar, but different.\nLast year\u2019s Spider-Man: No Way Home, which brought three different Spider-Men together, wasn\u2019t even the first time that had happened. The excellent 2018 animated movie Spider-Man: Into The Spiderverse introduced seven Spideys.\nAnd now, one of 2022\u2019s most highly-anticipated blockbusters is the Marvel movie Dr. Strange in the Multiverse of Madness which promises, well, multiple universes and multiple Masters of the Mystic Arts.\nThe multiverse is a bona fide movie genre, like time travel or giant robots, and A24\u2019s Everything Everywhere All At Once, starring the magnificent Michelle Yeoh, is the best multiverse movie ever made. So far.\nWritten and directed by Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, Everything Everywhere All At Once is a cosmic Kung-Fu comedy about how every choice we make is important, no matter how small.\nKwan and Scheinert, known collectively as Daniels, have painstakingly built a world made of countless worlds, and all of them are threatened by a force of evil known only as Jobu Tupaki.\nBut this celestial story starts in an unassuming place: the cramped living room of a rundown apartment above a struggling laundromat. It is there that we are first introduced to Evelyn Wang, a middle-aged Chinese immigrant who is being audited by the IRS.\nWhen we meet her, she\u2019s poring over business receipts, making breakfast for her ailing and tyrannical father, and trying to connect to her daughter, Eleanor, and her daughter's non-Chinese girlfriend, Becky.\nAnd then there\u2019s her failing marriage to her mousy husband Waymund.\nHer life is falling apart and by the end of the day, she\u2019ll be drafted into a multidimensional war to save the lives of every Evelyn, every Waymund, and every variation of every person in every universe. Along the way, she\u2019ll learn how to summon the abilities of alternate Evelyns, including one who spent her life training to be a martial arts master.\nEverything Everywhere All At Once is aptly titled. It is a kitchen sink movie, ambitious and eccentric, and philosophical. There are moments that are so frenetic and daring that it exposes Marvel movies for what they really are, which are simplistic entertainments for the young and the young at heart and there is nothing wrong with that.\nBut Everything Everywhere All At Once delivers genre-bending fights between body-jumping souls from other planes of existence alongside meditations on mid-life crises, generational trauma, and the American Dream, which has seen better days. Plus, it nails a complex emotional ending that is beyond the grasp of most big-budget Hollywood spectacles.\nIt is a big brave movie that works, even a couple of adolescent jokes seem out of place. Those gags are forgivable, human even. Nobody\u2019s perfect.\nAnd then there\u2019s Michelle Yeoh as beaten-down Evelyn. Yeoh is an actor of extraordinary versatility whose career has spanned decades. She is, possibly, the most underrated action movie star of the past couple of generations, starring in classic Hong Kong shoot \u2019em ups, James Bond movies, and Ang Lee\u2019s Academy Award-winning period fantasy Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.\nShe has starred in serious dramas and animated movies. In 2018, she played intimidating matriarch Eleanor in the global smash Crazy Rich Asians. Recently, she\u2019s popped up in Star Trek: Discovery and the Marvel hit Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings. She is, simply, iconic.\nAnd Everything Everywhere All At Once knows this, which is why Daniels makes sure to slyly reference Yeoh\u2019s career in every dimension where Evelyn exists. Well, almost every dimension.\nHow good is this movie? I was genuinely moved by a dimension where everyone has hot dogs for fingers. Does that sound absurd? Well, it should because it is and, also, beautiful? I don\u2019t know what else to tell you.\nYeoh is backed up by a talented cast, including the great James Hong as her character\u2019s grouchy dad and Jamie Lee Curtis having a good time as a cranky government bureaucrat (among other roles.) As Evelyn\u2019s daughter, Stephanie Hsu is both awkward and sassy, playing a young woman suffocated by her family and an all-powerful immortal.\nBut the secret to Everything Everywhere All At Once is actor Ke Huy Quan as Evelyn\u2019s husband, who loves his wife deeply, even in the reality where she didn\u2019t follow him to America. This is a comeback movie of sorts for Quan who is best known as Indiana Jones\u2019 quickwitted pint-sized sidekick Shortround in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom and the gadget-loving Data in The Goonies.\nBoth he and Yeoh are perfectly matched. It was a pleasure to watch them harmonize, gracefully, during the course of a two-hour and twenty-minute psychedelic \u2014 almost religious \u2014 romp.\nEverything Everywhere All At Once is mind-bending and heartwarming and it left me feeling grateful for everything I\u2019ve ever been given, everyone who I have ever loved and loved back, and even though I owe a lot of money in taxes this year, I am grateful to be alive and kicking. It should be seen, in every universe.\n\u2018The Green Knight\u2019 Is Sir Gawain\u2019s Last Temptation\nLove and loss mix in A24\u2019s mesmerizing new epicmedium.com", "comment_count": 4, "like_count": 348, "created_time": 1649878432831, "comment": [{"user_id": "106803413c5d", "comment_time": 1649878432831, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "b8a27bdc9002", "comment_time": 1649897479838, "comment": "I loved this movie.

The bigger, the better. When it comes to movies, I am greedy. I want smart dramas and superhero fairy tales and bleak ghost stories and car chase movies that also want to make their audiences cry. Is that too much to ask for?\nThis brings me back to roller coasters, which are fun because they are fast and dangerous and trigger buckets of adrenaline, and all you have to do is sit there. They sell speed, safely, and relatively cheaply. Michael Bay\u2019s new heist-gone-wrong thriller Ambulance does the same, even though a regular drink and popcorn still cost sixteen bucks.\n(Treat yourself or do what I did during my matinee: sneak in a box of Goobers, my favorite movie snack.)\nAmbulance is, first and foremost, fast. It hurtles forward from opening titles to closing credits. Somebody must have given 57-year-old Michael Bay a drone for his birthday because Ambulance is fueled by drone shots that zoom over buildings, dive like falcons, and chase after cars like avenging angels and it is all quite breathtaking on an IMAX screen.\nIf you love that Michael Bay feeling then the good news is Ambulance has it in spades. Fireballs, helicopters, scowling men. It\u2019s one of his best movies in a long time, a thrilling roller \u2014 well, you get it.\nLike Scorcese, Bay is a legend. Albeit a different kind of legend. He\u2019s one-third Tony Scott, one-third Steven Spielberg, and one-third Michael Bay, a frat boy daredevil with a big goofy heart. He\u2019s a filmmaker who loves his actors and is not afraid of filling the screen with intense close-ups before blowing something up.\nBay\u2019s skill at filming sweeping action scenes is only equaled by his famously kinetic editing style. The man has a knack for telling as much story as he can as quickly as humanly possible, sometimes with the help of an Aerosmith rock song. And then \u2014 without catching a breath \u2014 it's back to business: cars flying through the air, spinning, and then crashing into other cars.\nHis 1996 opus, The Rock, starring Nic Cage as a bumbling FBI nerd and Sean Connery, at peak silver fox, as the only man to ever escape Alcatraz, teaming up to break into the aforementioned prison, which is being held occupied by evildoers with an evil plan is a frenetic cinematic masterpiece. A few years later he directed Bruce Willis in Armageddon, about a team of oil drillers trained by NASA to stop a killer asteroid headed for Earth. That motion picture is a rocket.\nI don\u2019t want to suggest Bay\u2019s oeuvre is flawless by any means. Four out of five of his obnoxious Transformers movies are junkyard scrap (the first one is underrated, and then he kept remaking it, over and over, each a little more ridiculous than the previous one until we get one starring Anthony Hopkins and his robot butler.) Bay can be self-indulgent and when he is, he parodies himself. At his worst, his fast cuts and his total disregard for physics can trigger motion sickness or, even worse, boredom.\nBut this new picture of his is anything but.\nAmbulance is a chaotic, colorful, L.A. noir about bad choices that steals, respectfully, from Michael Mann\u2019s noble bank robber masterpiece Heat and, also, Speed, the best movie ever made about a runaway bus. Ambulance isn\u2019t wholly original and yet, it isn\u2019t a soulless corporate tentpole, born on a whiteboard in an executive boardroom. This is a film \u2014 loud and messy and exhilarating \u2014 not, simply, content for screens.\nThe movie opens with a few dewy-eyed scenes between a black and white boy who turns out to be the main characters. These brief, halcyon moments signal that Ambulance is a movie with a heart. Or, at least, aspires to that.\nIn Ambulance, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II plays Will, a vet, who can\u2019t afford his wife\u2019s life-saving medical treatments so has no choice but to reach out to his adopted brother, Danny, played by Jake Gyllenhaal.\nIt is both Will\u2019s unlucky and lucky day: Danny is a wildly successful criminal who just so happens to be putting together a brand new score, which goes pear-shaped pretty quickly when a young cop interrupts what should have been an easy-peasy holdup of a Federal bank.\nBefore you know it, that cop is shot and our brothers decide to save his life by hijacking an ambulance. Yes, the titular ambulance. Inside is the third most important person in this movie, Eiza Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s Cam, a world-weary EMT who is as electric as the paddles she uses to shock the wounded cop back to life. Gonz\u00e1lez is tremendous as the greatest first responder in all of Southern California.\nShe also combusts with the two leads, who make the movie. As Danny, Gyllenhaal is a charming creep, which is my favorite kind of Gyllenhaal. Yahya Abdul-Mateen II\u2019s Will is a hero backed into a corner and whenever Ambulance threatens to fly off a bridge, Abdul-Mateen II\u2019s gravitas brings it back to Earth.\nThe movie is a relentless chase through the fourth most important character: sunny Los Angeles, specifically, downtown L.A. Like other Bay movies, Ambulance also features an eclectic cast of actors, including Garret Dillahunt as a quirky cop on the hunt and his flirty computer-genius sidekick, played by Olivia Stambouilah.\nAmbulance was made on a relatively small budget for Bay, a paltry $40 million, but it punches above its weight. Bay is on a mission to out Bay himself.\nThere is a surgery scene that takes place as the ambulance is outracing an armada of cop cars and the entire sequence is a sloppy sandwich of tension: at one point, trauma doctors video conference in to help Cam operate on the dying cop and if the body horror and bullets aren\u2019t enough, the battery runs out on the tablet that was being used to beam her instructions. It\u2019s too much!\nThis is entertainment, ready-made to be seen in a theater. Big, dumb, and Bay bookends his masterpiece with more sentimental memories of Danny and Will when they were young and innocent. After two hours of near-constant drums and dizzying mayhem, he wants his audience to cry. You won\u2019t but thanks for trying, Michael.

Fifty years later, this number was closer to 60%.\nNow you have this, from the article above:\n\u201cThe 94% figure, of course, is really, really, really far from that,\u201d Jones says, \u201cwhich suggests that in 1960, you had all these not-very-talented white men who were doctors and lawyers and lots of extremely talented people from other groups who were excluded. In the past 50 years, these groups have been changing places.\u201d\nPer their research, then \u2014 which some can quibble with \u2014 greater opportunity over the last 50 years has contributed to 29% of earnings growth among black men, 51% among black women, and 77% among white women.\nStands to reason that replacing \u201cmediocre white men\u201d with \u201cmore diverse, talented people\u201d would impact GDP. As Andrew Yang consistently discusses, GDP is a flawed metric \u2014 a mom of a special-needs child works her ass off every day in many respects, but technically contributes nothing to GDP. So there are better ways to conceptualized all these issues, yes.\nHere\u2019s a money shot quote for you\nAgain, same article:\n\u201cOver the last 50 years, more than a quarter of all growth in the U.S. GDP is attributable to these declining barriers in the labor market,\u201d he says. \u201cIf we ask where, specifically, that growth came from, much of it is from women moving out of the home sector and working in the market, especially in highly skilled occupations.\u201d\nWe typically frame this up primarily around women exiting the home more \u2014 see also discussions about the impact of The Pill \u2014 but one could argue it\u2019s even broader than that. As we\u2019ve become more diverse, we\u2019ve ideally become more talented. Talent would seem to be a positive thing economically, right?\nNow, it is true that both female lawyers and secretaries historically made about 30% less than their male counterparts. And a lack of salary transparency ain\u2019t helping there.\nA few issues to consider\nMost people are not that \u201cwoke:\u201d Many people still view biz stuff as a \u201cman\u2019s game,\u201d which is kind of ridiculous. And when I say \u201ca man\u2019s game,\u201d I really mean \u201ca white man\u2019s game.\u201d We still need to overcome that.\nDiversity and fiscal ties: A lot of the same people mentioned above thing of diversity as a \u201cHR thing,\u201d which usually is code for \u201cI don\u2019t need to think about this except once a year where I nod at a meeting, right?\u201d That\u2019s another potential issue to finding more diverse pathways and making more money in the process.\nCognitive diversity: We need broader definitions of diversity, too.\nVocabulary: For check-writers to care about this stuff, we can\u2019t keep introducing words they don\u2019t understand, i.e. \u201cbelonging.\u201d HR is already overly-viewed as a Buzzword Boulevard department by world-builders. For them to get respect and find new pathways for people to allow talent to make money, these conversations need to occur more around \u201chard numbers\u201d and not softer, fluffier stuff like \u201cInclusion is a right!\u201d It is, but a guy concerned about KPIs more than his second-born does not believe that.\nThe real hidden economic engine\u2026\n\u2026 talent is a big part of the equation, sure, and getting talent over mediocrity into the right roles is too. But the actual big poppa pump coming down the pike is the Baby Boomer wealth transfer, which may help us with current debt and housing issues. There are different opinions on the wealth transfer \u2014 people say $70 trillion, give or take \u2014 especially around whether it will impact the top levels more. Of course it will. The top levels of an economic hierarchy are always impacted more than the lower levels. But I think the wealth transfer will probably help the \u201cmiddle,\u201d insofar as the middle still exists, out \u2014 and in the process maybe people will get out of debt, buy a home, have some additional children (to plow the soil!), and maybe even start the next Amazon. I mean, one can dream, right?\nWhenever you are down on the current state of things, though, remember this quote \u2192\n\u201cThe key insight, though, and what I find interesting and surprising is this: Looking back at the world in the 1960s, it is stunning how big the differences were in terms of men and women and blacks and whites in the workplace,\u201d Jones says. \u201cWe\u2019re far closer to an equitable balance today, and it\u2019s important to be aware that such gains aren\u2019t simply good for the groups that most obviously benefited, but for the economy as a whole \u2014 for all of us.\u201d\nLet\u2019s go get \u2019em, fam.", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 84, "created_time": 1648737969014, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Diversity", "Inclusion", "Belonging", "Work", "Future Of Work"]}, {"author": "Ted Bauer", "post_id": "aef4789ba6f8", "user_id": "794a1c55cb75", "title": "People (esp. managers) love to focus on tasks above all else", "content": "People (esp. managers) love to focus on tasks above all else\n\nThe answer to the question posed in this tweet is \u201cManagers are focused on tasks\u201d and/or \u201cExecutives are focused on growth and revenue.\u201d That\u2019s why stuff like \u201cretention\u201d and \u201chiring,\u201d which should be important, fall completely by the wayside \u2014 or, as is often the case with recruiting, they become about tasks instead of about longer-term strategy, which ends up being OK because most people can barely tell the difference and many people just want to be busy because it\u2019s akin to being high.\nLet me give you a personal example regarding the over-focus in society on tasks, which is not inherently a bad thing either. My wife and I are going through IVF right now. Here\u2019s a little bit on that. This is obviously a huge concept and very emotional and it\u2019s tied to lots of life perceptions, role perceptions, what your future looks like, etc. It\u2019s massive. Externally, does anyone really care, especially people with 2\u20133 kids already? No. Not in the least. What those people want is tasks. If I told them, \u201cHey, today is tough. Could you maybe grab us some food?\u201d most people absolutely would. Because it\u2019s a defined task, and that\u2019s what people are comfortable with. Bigger discussions, bigger questions, bigger life issues? People are not comfortable with those, writ large.\nAnd honestly it\u2019s the same at work. People don\u2019t like to get in deep on strategy for a whole host of reasons, but largely it\u2019s because strategy is a big, messy discussion and work is changing very fast for people right now and who has time for these deeper discourses when there are boxes and items to check off? The tasks are controllable and the bigger picture is often not, and when you can choose between a controlled road and a crazy road, you probably pick the controlled road. It\u2019s easier on your aging knees, right?\nNow, I\u2019m ignoring the fact of hierarchy for this discussion \u2014 a lot of times, people don\u2019t try to get involved with strategy because it\u2019s perceived as the domain of 5\u20137 guys at the top of an organization, and people would rather just do their tasks and try to excel within those to find ways to advance themselves and please their boss. It\u2019s easier, and it protects your family. Getting laid off and scrambling for work is no fun; I\u2019ve had to do it a few times. Many people protect against that inherently, and the easiest path to protection there is simple: focus on tasks and outputs, because that\u2019s what your boss is going to focus on and judge you through the prism of.\nTasks are good, even great, and they can advance projects effectively. However, when you spend 99% of your time focused on \u201cthe next thing on the list,\u201d you miss a lot of bigger discussions, i.e. in the tweet above: retention, hiring, team performance, burnout, etc. So what tends to happen is, companies turn a concept like \u201cburnout,\u201d which is very complicated and multi-faceted and requires companies to look deeply inward at their compensation and flexibility policies, and instead of doing the right things and having the right discussions around burnout, what companies do is they turn it into a series of check-boxes and tasks, i.e. \u201cOffer some free yoga classes in March!\u201d The tasks are OK, and they advance the discussion a tiny bit, and maybe a free yoga class really helps Susie one week, but is the bigger topic of burnout being discussed? No. It\u2019s being replaced by trackable spreadsheet items, essentially. So some stuff is getting done, but is stuff really changing? No.\nAnd honestly, many times that\u2019s how companies like it. Look at how most companies handle diversity initiatives, which is almost universally a performative approach. It\u2019s handled that way because companies \u2014 or, rather, the men that currently lead many of them \u2014 don\u2019t really want things to change, all-in. They want the appearance of change through task and project management. That means they remain comfortable, the illusion of \u201cthings getting done\u201d is created, and the status quo doesn\u2019t truly budge. When someone pushes back on the lack of real change, they can point to the tasks \u2014 \u201cWe created a committee! We had an off-site!\u201d \u2014 and then flounder about screaming \u201cWe need to focus on the business and keeping the lights on! It was a pandemic!\u201d, despite the fact that they never believed in the pandemic, never wore a mask, etc, etc. We all know the drill.\nTasks are sacrosanct. Bigger discussions? Much less so. And that\u2019s the cornerstone of why life and work can often feel so hamster wheel-y.", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 25, "created_time": 1650027746786, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Work", "Future Of Work", "Tasks", "Life Lessons", "Change Management"]}, {"author": "Ted Bauer", "post_id": "d7364f4644da", "user_id": "794a1c55cb75", "title": "Your company does not value you that much, no.", "content": "Your company does not value you that much, no.\n\nHere\u2019s a good pull quote from this article:\nThe danger of capitalist notions of value is that they\u2019re linked to economic output, a metric that misses, well, almost everything. To an algorithm, the worth of a conversation between two people might be insights into what they\u2019re likely to buy. To the two people, of course, the worth is the conversation itself. Odell contends that when our identities depend solely on what we contribute to a company\u2019s P&L statement, we\u2019re likely to end up losing who we really are.\nLet me also direct your attention to this:\nHe cites the seminal research by economist William Lazonick, who studied S&P 500 companies from 2003 to 2012 and discovered that they routinely spend 54% of their earnings buying back their own stock (reducing the number of outstanding shares and driving up share prices) and 37% of their earnings on dividends \u2014 both of which benefit shareholders. That leaves just 9% of earnings for investment in their business and their people.\nHm, OK. Take those two together for a second.\nThe 200 People But 4 People Matter problem\nI traveled a lot for work in 2018, and I had a lot of discussions with guys in different verticals in airport bars, hotel bars, conference suites, and the like. I used this idea I\u2019m about to describe probably 15 times. It was never disagreed with.\nHere\u2019s the concept: Let\u2019s say you have a 200-person company, right? There are lots of people running around doing busy things and moving between meetings and the like. In reality, the lights of this company are kept on by the performance of four really good salespeople. There is a \u201cMarketing Coordinator\u201d somewhere with a kid in private school, and if one of those salespeople gets divorced and loses his/her edge for a while, that Marketing Coordinator salary may be dropped, or he/she may be laid off, and that kid isn\u2019t going to private school next year. The ecosystem has 200 people, all of whom we are taught to believe matter and \u201care part of the team,\u201d but in reality 4 people actually matter and the rest of us need them to keep slaying dragons.\nNow, this isn\u2019t a perfect analogy and oftentimes those four are helped out by others. Sometimes the C-Suite does a lot. It does vary. But we all know that we create a lot of bullshit jobs. And in the process of that, we have extra salary and insurance to carry, and we need to perform better, and that falls on a small sliver of people.\nThe capitalist ethos is about value coming from production, which has gotten very twisted in recent years because many seem to think \u201cbusy\u201d and \u201cproductive\u201d are somehow the same thing. (They are not.)\nIt\u2019s weird how we structure companies. Out of every five people, maybe 1.5 to 2 face revenue directly. So, in essence, all the other people are irrelevant to the idea of the company. It\u2019s the same thing as how science looks at a 50 year-old woman without kids and is like \u201cWell, she is biologically useless.\u201d She could have a tremendous amount of friends and admiration, but science\u2019s hard line will say \u201cNope, she don\u2019t matter.\u201d Well, if you don\u2019t face revenue in a for-profit, the reality is you don\u2019t really matter.\nAnd what happens then?\nYou try 892 other things to make sure that you will matter in some way, which is usually going to be around \u2192\nTelling everyone how busy you are\nControlling a process\nHoarding a subset of information\nKissing ass of the main stakeholders\nSitting at your desk at 7pm, even if you\u2019ve done nothing all day, so stakeholders see you as they leave\nThose are usually \u201cThe Big Five,\u201d although others sneak in too.\nWhen we are not treated as relevant and important, but we still are expected to physically be in a place much of our waking day, we are going to find ways to be seen as relevant and important. This is the nature of being a human being.\nThis is largely why \u201cEmployee Engagement\u201d or \u201cEmployee Experience\u201d stats don\u2019t really budge despite all the money, tech, and resources we put at it \u2014 because, at the end of the day, you cannot better the experience of someone who feels they don\u2019t matter despite how hard they believe themselves to grind/hustle, and you cannot make them matter to a company that cares primarily about a capitalist value system.\nThat\u2019s where we\u2019re at, and I don\u2019t think tech fixes that, really.\nNow, are you \u201cjust a number\u201d to these organizations? At some places, yes. At many places, it\u2019s a more nuanced answer. You are just a number in some ways, but you can still make great friends at work, do some cool projects, and overall show gratitude.

They very quickly organized chat groups, Telegram channels and Facebook teams to set up a welcome and information center at Hauptbahnhof, arrange for accommodation, further transport to other cities, clothing, food, medical needs, pet needs, and needs tailored to LGBTQI and BIPOC groups.\nOne of the very first to jump to action for accommodation was the Facebook group Host A Sister, a group originally developed for solo female travelers to find safe accommodation as they explored the world. My niece alerted me to Host A Sister\u2019s efforts, and I immediately added my name a spreadsheet with my contact details, type of accommodation available, how many people I could provide shelter to, and for how long.\nAlmost immediately, I received emails from the organizers looking for accommodations for families, mothers and children, small groups of people traveling together, and just as immediately other women able to host larger groups jumped to the chance to help. Eventually, I was matched with M., a third-year med student from Kharkiv, arriving on March 8.\nM. had spent one or two nights in Poland, where receiving stations and camps were set up for evacuees. She arrives in Berlin with a camping backpack, a bedroll, and wearing snowboarding trousers and heavy boots. She tells me she had packed up very quickly on the evening of 27 February, prepared to sleep rough. She told me it took her 10 days to get to the border, a trip that would normally only take a few hours by car.\nHer eagerness to pick up where her life was so cruelly interrupted, was something that most of the people arriving from Ukraine share.\nWe get her settled into my flat, with a bed and fresh bedsheets and blankets. She insists that she can just use her sleeping bag, not wanting to be a bother, telling me she will only stay as long as it takes her to find a job and her own flat. Her eagerness to re-establish normalcy in her life, to be ready to go back to Ukraine as soon as possible, to try and pick up where her life was so cruelly interrupted, is something I learn that most of the people arriving from Ukraine feel.\nAfter all, Berlin is only a short train ride away, many have even been here before on holiday. People arrive from the border in normal, everyday clothes, with roller suitcases and stuffed animals and laptops and headphones, clean clothes, food in their bellies, pets in pet carriers. They have not walked for days, piled into small boats and headed out to sea, washed up on Greek islands or sent away from Italian coasts, or starved in the forests of Belarus and Serbia on their way to Germany.\nGeographically, they\u2019re not that far from home.\n\nI assure M. that she\u2019s welcome as long as she needs, and there is no hurry. We set her up with clean towels, her own set of keys, and a tour of the neighborhood at her request. As she relaxes a bit into her first day, tells me she is feeling lost. Her entire life has just been snatched away from her. Her future is unwritten. She is unanchored.\nM.\u2019s mother chose to stay in Ukraine, in a village outside of Kharkiv. M. says she is safe. M. says her mother understands why M. fled, but also doesn\u2019t understand. M. says she and her mother have a complicated relationship.\nI say, \u201cI think that is the relationship of all mothers and daughters.\u201d\nHer first night, M. says it\u2019s nice to feel safe, to not hear bombs. But she also says she feels bad for feeling safe. Then she goes to bed, and sleeps for 10 hours.\n\u201cMy mother is an optimist. She can hear the bombs, but they\u2019re not that close.\u201d\nAs the days go on and we get to know a bit more about each other, I watch M. as she navigates days that are half-filled with figuring out how to register her status and get the support she needs, and half-filled with nothing, wandering around Berlin with no direction. Almost feeling like she is on vacation but not on vacation, drifting and untethered and yearning to not be lost.\n\u201cMy mother is an optimist,\u201d she tells me one day after a brief call with her mom back in Ukraine. \u201cShe says she can hear shelling, but it\u2019s not too close. She\u2019s spending her days reading and listening to music,\u201d M. laughs, but with laughter that never reaches all the way up to her eyes that are full of worry and dread.\nHer mother is only 3 years older than me.\nM.\u2019s only other family member is an uncle in Israel, who says he can\u2019t do anything for her right now because his flat is already rented out. I am enraged by this. I am generally enraged by the entire situation, by the unjustness of it. Enraged by a guy I chat with on a dating app who soppily tells me he will only offer his spare room to a refugee mother and child, prioritizing a childbearing woman over solo travelers, as though women like M. don\u2019t have the same value, aren\u2019t worth sheltering, too.\nPhoto by Marjan Blan | @marjanblan on Unsplash\nIn her normal life, before the war, M. doesn\u2019t watch much TV, reads medical journals in her spare time. She listens to classical music, and really likes symphonies. I play Miles Davis\u2019 Sketches of Spain for her. I tell her that there is something in those long, clarion opening notes that quenches a thirst deep inside of me, that gives me a feeling of profound peace.\nI don\u2019t tell her that it\u2019s the peace you feel when you\u2019re home.\nRumors of traffickers are starting to be shared, alerts about people disappearing.\nM. is incredibly resourceful. She continues to consult the various Telegram channels passing information back in forth, in Ukrainian, Russian, German, English. People helping people as best they can. M. throws a question out: anyone have a lead on a flat? She gets an answer immediately: yes, for 2 months, in a small town outside of Cologne.\nIt sounds too good to be true. We\u2019re both wary. Rumors of traffickers are starting to be shared, alerts about people disappearing. I suggest she ask a few pointed questions. The woman offering the apartment figures out M.\u2019s concern, gives her a call to reassure her. Actually puts her on the phone with her boyfriend\u2019s mother, who is Russian from city outside of Moscow and speaks in an accent that M. recognizes.\nShe takes the flat.\nShe tells me that her university in Kharkhiv will continue with online study, news that M. herself is surprised by. She\u2019s figured out her registration, has an appointment to open a bank account, and is applying for her work permit. She wants to go back to Ukraine \u2014 she tells me about the mountain ranges she\u2019s hiked, the things she loved her in city \u2014 but she doesn\u2019t believe returning will be possible for months.\nShe\u2019s says this with gentleness, and kindness \u2014 for herself, for her country. But she\u2019s realistic.\nShe\u2019ll make a good doctor one day.\nSusie Kahlich is the creator of Pretty Deadly Self Defense, an upbeat, user-focused women\u2019s self defense program designed as an alternative to traditional fear-based self defense.", "comment_count": 23, "like_count": 1589, "created_time": 1648280829756, "comment": [{"user_id": "502b7e1d0c5c", "comment_time": 1648280829756, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "f12d92a3dc2d", "comment_time": 1648633050688, "comment": "Didn\u2019t know about Host a sister!

I wasn\u2019t in the technology world or the start-up world, and I was not aware that most start ups followed a specific formula when they launched a new product or business. I ended up following that same formula, although purely intuitively, as it simply seemed like the best way to find out if I had a viable business idea.\nThe idea was this: get more women to learn self defense by making it easy, accessible and fun.\nIn the start-up world, you\u2019re supposed to start by stating the problem you\u2019re trying to solve. But the problem of violence against women is one that is such an ingrained part of every woman\u2019s existence, learning self defense seems obvious.\nViolence against women has been a problem for over 2000 years. That\u2019s actually not the problem I was trying to solve. I was trying to solve the problem of women waiting until after they experience violence to learn self defense, which bears the additional risk of carrying trauma that affects every aspect of life, and is often passed on to next generations.\nMy first goal with Pretty Deadly was to test the structure and content of the self-defense course itself, get feedback, revise and reiterate where necessary, and measure potential effects and results. Because of the nature of learning self-defense for women, those results could take a longer time to manifest, so I had scheduled 18 months for this phase of product development in order to be sure I had a good product-market fit.\nBy 2018, I was ready for the next stage: I had to make sure the product (in this case teaching the self-defense course) was replicable. My first step was to identify a potential trainer, someone who had taken the program and showed a consistent interest not only in our message and mission, but also in sharing that message and mission with others. I invited a young woman whose enthusiasm for the program was unmatched, and trained her to teach the program.\nHer first outing was to take over some of my classes when I had to travel for other teaching or promotional opportunities. To my delight, I learned from my course participants that our new trainer incorporated her own passions into her teaching style \u2014 which was my ultimate measure of success. This trainer is a passionate advocate of permaculture and permaculture design, and sustainability, and circular economies. She taught everyone in the group self defense through permaculture \u2014 or permaculture through self defense. To this day, I still do not know exactly what she told my course students, but they have stayed in touch with me, and still speak so highly of what they learned from her, not only with self-defense techniques from Pretty Deadly, but also a new way of thinking about sustainability and climate change.\nAfter 3\u20134 months of being the only additional trainer, the next step was to open the trainer certification program to all Pretty Deadly graduates and measure how many people were interested in becoming trainers. I offered the certification training for free. That taught me a very valuable lesson that I\u2019ve since seen reitereated time and again in the start-up world: the best way to test viability is if people are willing to pay for your product. As a result, the response to offering free certification was small. (I worked with the smaller group anyway.)\nOnce new trainers were certified, I was ready for the next product test: I wanted to see if two classes in the same city would compete with or complement each other. Berlin is a large city, and understandably, people don\u2019t want to travel 30 to 45 minutes after work to take a class. I hired one of the newly certified trainers to teach a course on one side of town, while I taught a parallel course on the other of town.\nThe experiment worked beautifully, and that we were able to offer participants flexibility when they attended classes. If they were not able to make Tuesday nights class on the other side of town, they could make it up with me on Thursday night on my side of town.\nTesting this phase was a 6-month R&D period, and it lasted through the end of 2019. At the same time another phase in my strategy, had been accelerated: we opened in a second market, with a new trainer launching courses in Paris. I had not scheduled for this until 2021, but I just couldn\u2019t resist the opportunity\u2026 and I paid the price for it. We did not have the resources at the time to support the trainer in Paris in the way she needed to be supported. She complained about it directly, and she was right to do so. My only explanation was that we were not ready to open in Paris, which frankly wasn\u2019t a solid enough explanation for either of us. Unfortunately that trainer then cycled away and onto something else. Lesson learned.\nPhoto by SOULSANA on Unsplash\nBack in Berlin, I was ready to take my start up (as I now started thinking of it) on to the next phase of it\u2019s evolution: moving the courses out of community centers and martial art spaces, and into the spaces women usually go. However, the pandemic came along and put a stop to everything. While we remained locked down for nearly 2 years here in Germany, especially in the sports and martial arts industries, I used that time to test online courses which, it turned out, was a great way to reach markets far beyond Europe.\nThrough one of these online courses, I met Zipporah Kuteesa in Uganda. Zipporah showed so much interest in sharing what she learned from the online course with her immediate community in Uganda, that I invited her to become a Community Guide: someone who is well-versed in our mobile app techniques, and can responsibly lead informal training sessions (or \u201cApp Parties\u201d as we like to call them). Zipporah was all for the idea and passed her Community Guide Certification Course with enthusiasm.\nAs the lockdowns went on, I invited Zipporah to cohost the Pretty Deadly podcast with me (which, by the way, is available on Spotify, Amazon, iTunes, and SoundCloud \u2014 however, I will be removing old episodes soon, and making them only available to our subscribed members. So if you want to hear the Pretty Deadly podcast for free, you\u2019d better subscribe now!).\nWhile Zipporah was cohosting the Pretty Deadly podcast with me, it became so evident that her understanding of our philosophy, techniques, mission and method was so deep that I invited her to become a Master Trainer: someone who is qualified to certify other Trainers, Online Coaches, and Community Guides in the Pretty Deadly Program.\nEven though we have not physically met, through our Zoom meetings, phone calls and extensive emails in addition to our podcast episodes, I felt very confident that Zipporah could successfully transmit the Pretty Deadly Program to others.\nThanks to ongoing Corona chaos, getting Zipporah started to certify other trainers has been slow. Despite many delays, she has remained patient and responsive and engaged. Finally, this weekend, Zipporah has certified her very first graduate, a brand new Pretty Deadly Community Guide (a certification course that is possible to take online).\nThis is what empowerment looks like: teaching self defense techniques to others is one thing; passing the ability to teach them on to someone else is something else indeed.\nZipporah\u2019s Community Guide Certification Course this weekend has been a rousing success. But even more delightful, is Zipporah\u2019s joy and pride (and of course my own) and knowing that she herself has now empowered someone else.\nI cannot tell you exactly what this feels like; it doesn\u2019t seem like we have a lot of references in our cultures to help us express this feeling. It\u2019s far more than pride and gratitude and awe; it\u2019s an honour, but\u2026 it\u2019s also something more. Maybe this is what it feels like when your child graduates valedictorian or becomes a doctor; whatever it is, it\u2019s profound and inspiring and deeply spiritual, too.\nI am so thrilled to welcome our new Community Guide teammember, and I am so thrilled that Pretty Deadly continues to grow. But most of all I am thrilled to share in the joy that Zipporah expressed to me at successfully certifying a Community Guide. It looked like this:\n\nI know this is only the first of many certifications that Zipporah will oversee and conduct, especially in her native East Africa, but also in West Africa, thanks to a growing partnership we are developing in Nigeria.\nWe are so thrilled to be on this journey, and to share and support Zipporah\u2019s journey as well. There really is no feeling like women supporting other women and watching them soar.\nSusie Kahlich is the creator of Pretty Deadly Self Defense, an upbeat, user-focused women\u2019s self defense program designed as an alternative to traditional fear-based self defense.", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 2, "created_time": 1644766322566, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Startup Lessons", "Women In Business", "Womens Health", "Female Founders", "Female Entrepreneurs"]}, {"author": "Susie Kahlich", "post_id": "5dfa73c187a2", "user_id": "502b7e1d0c5c", "title": "Empowering Women in Shared Mobility", "content": "Empowering Women in Shared Mobility\nWe\u2019re Working with Movmi to improve gender equity in transportation spaces\n\nAn idea our team has been working on for a while now is to create self defense safety cards (like the safety procedure cards you find in airplanes) into existing ride-hailing apps like Uber, as well as municipal metro ticketing apps, to give female commuters tools that help disrupt and de-escalate violence, even while help is on the way. Inspired by our subway- and taxi units from Pretty Deadly Self Defense courses, we\u2019ll be building an API key to integrate directly into host apps.\nOur goal is to license the API key to private companies as well as municipal ticketing systems, so riders can access safety tips immediately. Creating simple graphics that don\u2019t require language gives access to immigrants as well as tourists and, more importantly for our work, opens up a city and opportunities to girls and women to pursue education, better jobs, and social activities, as well as access to healthcare and senior care, that may be on the other side of town.\nMy cofounder and I submitted our idea the Empower Women in Shared Mobility program hosted every year by movmi, a shared mobility consulting company in Canada working to promote healthier communities with innovative mobility solutions that increase transportation options. Movmi has built a co-hort of 100+ women leaders and experts in transportation through its Women in Shared Mobility interview series, seeking to rebalance design bias and diversify the workforce in transportation systems.\nEvery year, movmi hosts EmpowerWISM, a program dedicated to encouraging and empowering women-led companies within the shared mobility industry. The winning venture receives a 12 month mentoring package from movmi.\nAnd this year, that\u2019s us! They\u2019ll be providing lots of advice, support and PR as we go forward, as well as access to their network \u2014 crucial for us, because their network includes both private stakeholders as well as former and current government officials focused on the transportation sector.\nAlso: we get to go Paris! Part of our winning package is a start-up booth at Autonomy Paris and return flights to Paris provided by INVERS. Exciting because Paris is Paris, but also exciting because Anne Hidalgo, the mayor of Paris, is a huge champion of green transportation and alternative mobility for urban centers.\nOur entire team is both overwhelmed and overjoyed with hope that, with Movmi\u2019s mentorship, our contribution improves mobility options for women and girls the world over, and rebalances gender equity in mobility solutions.\nYou can watch the EmpowerWISM Awards ceremony and learn more about movmi and the program here.\nSusie Kahlich is the creator of Pretty Deadly Self Defense, an upbeat, user-focused women\u2019s self defense program designed as an alternative to traditional fear-based self defense.", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 0, "created_time": 1644153499059, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Mobility", "Transportation", "Gender Equality", "Urban Planning", "Violence Against Women"]}, {"author": "Susie Kahlich", "post_id": "7084d69481af", "user_id": "502b7e1d0c5c", "title": "The Truth About the \u201cBystander Effect\u201d", "content": "The Truth About the \u201cBystander Effect\u201d\nThis legend won\u2019t die, and it\u2019s harmful to women\nPhoto by Amir Arabshahi on Unsplash\nUpdate: At the time of writing, I was unaware of the recent case in Philadelphia, where a woman was raped on the subway while passengers on the train failed to intervene, but several did record it on their smart phones. Thanks to a kind reader, I\u2019ve updated this article to include it.\nCNN and several other news outlets have probed deeper about the story that\u2019s now gone viral: that no one intervened, and no one called 911. CCTV cameras show people getting on and off the train during the incident, mostly unaware of what was happening. But the footage does show that some people were aware, and they filmed it. For the record, at least one person did call 911, and the police boarded the train and the interrupted the rape in progress\u2026 although the rape had already been going on for six minutes.\nPerhaps because I\u2019m of a different generation, it simply does not occur to me that the first response to distress or violence would ever be to record it, rather than call for help or intervene. However, there is now more than one generation who have been socialized to video as a way to bear witness, especially in response to racialized police brutality, as a form of smart phone vigilantism.\nIt seems, however, that no one has ever learned or been taught how to do anything else: what next steps to take, or how to determine when it\u2019s time to intervene rather than record, and how to do that safely for both parties.\nThat said, we have been developing a smart phone integration for women\u2019s safety that fills what we call the 7-minute safety app gap (the time it takes to respond to an SOS call from a safety tracking app). We have, however, only been developing it from the victim\u2019s point of view and the immediacy of an attack. Thanks to Elle Beau \u2747\ufe0e who brought the Philadelphia incident to my attention, we\u2019ll now be adding intervention options for bystanders as well.\n[The unanswered question in this is: how do you prevent a bystander from recording an incident for their own pleasure and, worse, from uploading it to porn sites? I would argue that the law must evolve to view and pursue this act of violation, a secondary rape if you will, as a criminal and punishable offence.]\nAre these the perfect solutions to reducing violence against women in public spaces? No, but they can disrupt violence, and by doing so, significantly reduce it. The issues and perceived worth based on skin color, class and religion must also be addressed, and these are issues that must be addressed with the voices of the actual women who are most subject to, and most suffer from, these lethal biases.\nHere\u2019s the original article:\nBack when I was still giving self-defense classes in my living room, a woman who was participating in the course showed up to class one day flustered, out of breath, and demanding to know if I had any mouthwash in the house. She was so keyed up, she practically pushed her way into the bathroom before I could even hand her my bottle of Listerine.\nWhat was that all about?\nWhen she came out of the bathroom and felt a bit calmer, she explained to me and the rest of the class what had happened:\nShe had been on the bus on her way to our class when a fellow passenger suddenly collapsed. He had stopped breathing. My student was certified in CPR, so she performed CPR on him and gave him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.\nThe bus driver and the other passengers simply looked on. My student managed to resuscitate the man just before the ambulance arrived and took over. She wanted mouthwash, because she had not been carrying mouth protection, and wanted to keep take whatever hygienic measure she could.\nAlthough this was undoubtedly a heroic gesture, she was not interested in our admiration or praise. What she said next really surprised me:\n\u201cWhy am I always the one to respond?\u201d she asked. \u201cI saw the man start to show signs of distress, but when I looked around, no one else was reacting. Even when he collapsed, I hesitated to see if someone else would help him. No one moved. So it was up to me. This has happened before, where I seem to be the only person around who knows CPR. So I\u2019m always the one who has to put my own health at risk by performing CPR on someone else. I\u2019m glad the man survived. I\u2019m glad I could resuscitate him. I\u2019m glad the ambulance came. I think he\u2019ll be OK. But why doesn\u2019t anyone else help?\u201d\n\nWhat she was talking about is the Bystander Effect. The Bystander Effect is a common concern for women in particular but is known to all genders: it is the phenomenon of non-response to a person or situation in distress. Why don\u2019t people help?\nThe Bystander Effect is a term that came about from a well-known urban legend that originated in the 1960s. I\u2019m sure you know it: a woman was raped and murdered in New York City in full sight of a crowd of people. She cried for help, and no one did anything. She was killed.\nThe story is a true story, kind of. The story is the story of Kitty Genovese, who was raped and stabbed to death by Winston Moseley in front of her house in Queens, while her neighbors saw and heard everything, but refused to come to her aid.\nAt least, that\u2019s how journalist Martin Gansberg reported it.\nThis story was run in The New York Times shortly after Kitty Genevose was killed in 1964, and has been in circulation ever since. It spawned countless studies, two laws, the 911 emergency number, a best-selling book and generation after generation of people believing that this is what humans do, this is our default: selfishness, cold-heartedness, an indifference to helping a woman in need.\nThe Kitty Genovese story is usually accompanied by what has become the moral of the story in the women\u2019s self defense industry, which is: don\u2019t yell \u2018help\u2019 because no one will come.\nWhat it is never accompanied by is the other side of the story.\nKitty Genovese ca. 1964\nKitty Genovese was on her way home from work as a bartender, at around 2:30 a.m. on 13 March 1964. She was approached by a man with a knife. Genovese ran toward her door, but the man grabbed her and stabbed her. She screamed.\nA neighbor, Robert Mozer, yelled out his window, \u201cLet that girl alone!\u201d causing the attacker to flee.\nGenovese, seriously injured, crawled to the rear of her apartment building, out of the view of any possible witnesses. Ten minutes later, her attacker returned, stabbed her, raped her and stole her money.\nHer screams the second time were heard by her friend and neighbor, Sophia Farrar, who ran out in her nightgown to help. Sophia found Kitty and screamed for someone to call the police. Police arrived several minutes later. Genovese died in the ambulance on the way to the hospital.\nThat is the whole story. So what\u2019s missing from the urban legend version is the fact that people actually did respond, people actually did help, people actually did try to save her. There are times when violence is bigger, larger, than anyone else can control. But that doesn\u2019t mean people don\u2019t help if they can.\nPhoto by Timon Studler on Unsplash\nWhen I lived in Los Angeles, there was a day I had some business in Downtown LA. I parked my car in a parking lot, and as I was exiting the lot, a car came out of nowhere, pulled up to the sidewalk where a homeless man was standing, playing a guitar. Two guys got out of the car, yelled at the homeless man\u201cwe told you not to touch our car!\u201c And proceeded to beat the crap out of him.\nA homeless woman happened to be strolling by at about the same time, and stopped and stood next to me, frozen to the spot. She urged me to call the police, which is what I was trying to do, fighting with a weak signal.\nNeither one of us was willing to step around the violence that was happening, for fear of that violence being turned on us.\nI had been training at that point but only for a couple of years. I didn\u2019t have that many skills \u2014 certainly not enough to insert myself between two burly, enraged guys and a homeless man without getting myself hurt.\nLater that night I went to the Dojo, and I talked to my Sensei about the incident. I told him what happened, and told him I felt terrible. He said, \u201cyou did the right thing. You haven\u2019t been training long enough to defend yourself let alone another person against to big guys. You must keep yourself safe first. Otherwise, how can you help others?\u201d\nIt\u2019s not too dissimilar from safety procedures on an airplane: put on your own oxygen mask before helping others. The interesting part of that directive is that it always includes the phrase \u201cbefore helping others\u201d. It implies, assumes, and even encourages the idea of helping others, once you have secured your own mask.\n\nWhen we have conducted Ally Training at Pretty Deadly, one of the first things we do is teach our participants that if they do not feel safe intervening, if they do not feel they can defend themselves should things go south, then do not intervene. There are many ways to help people: sometimes that\u2019s calling security, sometimes it\u2019s being witness to something, sometimes it\u2019s causing a distraction. It is not required to physically insert yourself into someone else\u2019s emergency as the only way to help them.\nThinking back on that incident with the homeless man, I can see now that it would have been foolish of me to try and stop those men. At the very least, I would have been pushed away. More likely, I would have drawn their anger to me, along with the misogynistic desire to punish. I would\u2019ve been toast.\nI do have a right to protect myself, to defend myself. And I have a right to decide for myself that a situation is too dangerous for me to intervene. That is also self defense.\nNow, after much more training and lots of research, I understand what my Sensei was trying to teach me about the Bystander Effect: everyone has a self-defense system. You cannot override it. And everyone has the right to defend themselves, even if that means not inserting yourself in someone else\u2019s violence.\nPhoto by Eddi Aguirre on Unsplash\nGoing back to my student and her CPR heroics, more importantly going back to her question why doesn\u2019t anyone help: had I been on the bus with her that day, I also could not have helped. I have let my CPR certification lapse (note to self: update CPR certification!). I would not have had the tools, the skills, or the knowledge, to safely help the other individual.\nIf it had been violence, I would have had to override my own self-defense system in order to help someone else. But that is what training is for.\n\nUsing the Kitty Genovese story as a cautionary tale for girls and women is a common tool in women\u2019s self defense, almost always followed up with its moral: don\u2019t yell for help, because people don\u2019t want to get involved.\nInstead, the common wisdom goes, yell \u201cfire\u201d because people will respond to that, since they are more likely to have something to lose (i.e.g, property).\nMy first response to this when it comes up in our classes is: are you a fireman? Because I am not. I am not trained to override my own self defense system in the face of fire, and run inside a burning building to save other people. If someone yells fire, I run in the opposite direction. So would most people.\nBut my second response \u2014 and the more important one \u2014 is that telling the false version of this urban legend serves only to keep girls and women disempowered. It tells us that our lives aren\u2019t worth saving. It tells us that there is no one to help us, no one to save us\u2026 except the person telling the story. Which is a pretty classic example of coercive control.\nAnd telling girls and women that crying out for help will only be met with indifference is also reinforcing the gender stereotype that women will not be believed, that our voices are not heard, and our experiences are automatically dismissed: No one will help you. No one will come if you scream. No one will believe you.\nTelling that story to boys and men also reinforces that gender stereotype about women for them.\nThe thing is: none of it is true.\nIt\u2019s important to remember that every single person on Earth will be shocked in a shocking situation; meaning, almost everyone will, for a moment, stand still trying to absorb exactly what is happening around them. That shock gets processed at different speeds by different people, and those who have the tools to jump into action and help will do so. Those who do not have the tools, won\u2019t. People help when they have the capacity to help. If they do not have the capacity, they don\u2019t.\nIt\u2019s a simple as that.\nAnother common myth that I hear in self defense in relation to the Bystander Effect is: if you are being attacked in public, make eye contact with someone in the crowd to connect with their humanity and spring them into action. To this, I recommend you read my article about impossible situations.\nSusie Kahlich is the creator of Pretty Deadly Self Defense, an upbeat, user-focused women\u2019s self defense program designed as an alternative to traditional fear-based self defense.", "comment_count": 10, "like_count": 360, "created_time": 1643561945865, "comment": [{"user_id": "502b7e1d0c5c", "comment_time": 1643561945865, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "152b7cad7f04", "comment_time": 1643600744074, "comment": "I might as well say it before someone else does, but the recent incident where the woman was raped on the subway and no-one even used their phone to call for help will be cited as an example of how what you are saying isn't quite true.

That\u2019s it in a nutshell.\nI view the confusion as a perfect misalignment of priorities. Certain things resemble the bread and butter of a reason an employee will stay. Other miscellaneous items are only are a cherry on top (insert ping pong tables). For example, employers often confuse intangible things like a family-oriented company and tight-knit culture for reasons why employees should never leave. Their approach is backward because they want everyone to think like an owner but remain an employee.\nHere\u2019s what employers who unlocked the puzzle to the Great Resignation already figured out. So if you\u2019re an employee, keep looking until you find these things.\nStart with the bread and butter (pay and benefits)\nCompensation and benefits mark the starting point of your career. If a company doesn\u2019t offer competitive salaries and benefits, why should you bother staying?\nI\u2019ve worked in places where employers pay below the market and expect that to continue for a lifetime. I could afford to work at a company in my early 20s that didn\u2019t offer health insurance or a retirement plan. But eventually, I can\u2019t stay under my parents\u2019 insurance and can receive those staple benefits elsewhere. Then, employers share the nerve to make a counteroffer: a disguised and last-ditched attempt to show their appreciation (but only after you gave your notice).\nWorking at a company with stellar pay and benefits keeps you from wondering if the grass is greener on the other side. Instead, you\u2019re offered stability to not only work but enjoy life. Traveling isn\u2019t a dream but a doable reality. Significant milestones like buying a house or starting a family aren\u2019t delayed in favor of sweating to gain entry-level experience.\nI always see people on social media blaming unemployment. Additional unemployment checks must be the root cause of everyone\u2019s laziness until it\u2019s not. More people are self-employed. Others realize working minimum wage and getting yelled at every day isn\u2019t the life they want.\nThe U.S. isn\u2019t providing supplemental unemployment anymore. But increased wages are now demanded. And companies that refuse to jump on the bandwagon will get left behind, scrambling for bread crumbs.\nWhen I visited my hometown for the holidays, I saw hiring signs everywhere. But a local pho shop advertised a starting wage of $25/hr, a $1,000 sign-on bonus, and tips. Each time I visit, the restaurant is bustling and fully staffed. $25/hr in an industry that typically forces employees to rely on tips to make ends meet is life-changing. It\u2019s like they understood the market too quickly.\nWhat job seekers should look for:\nIf you\u2019re interviewing and a company is offering below market, skip the opportunity. Your interviewer is a byproduct of a company stuck in its ways. They don\u2019t want to increase pay because they can\u2019t rationalize paying someone more than they\u2019ve had in the past. So rather than increasing salaries across the board for their current employees, they\u2019ll wait out and lose revenue for someone willing to accept low pay.\nIf companies aren\u2019t begging you to join in this Great Resignation market, it\u2019s better to move on.\nFlexible work creates an ideal environment\nIt\u2019s 2021 and a candidate\u2019s market. Offering flexibility is the best bet for a company to negotiate and attract candidates.\nWhen I went home for Thanksgiving, every friend I talked to admitted they were looking to join the Great Resignation. The reason boiled down to the following: \u201cMy company is forcing me to go back into the office.\u201d\nThe keyword is forcing. As an employee, they have no say in the matter.\nFortunately, some executives view this predicament differently. Dan Price, CEO of Gravity Payments, previously made headlines for paying his employees a minimum $70,000 salary. During the pandemic, Price continued to lead the way on remote flexibility.\nA lot of CEOs urgently encouraged management to rein in all their employees back to the office. But, on the other hand, Price surveyed his staff on whether they wanted to continue work remote, a hybrid, or back into the office. The breakdown included 7% wanted to go back to the office full time, 31% wanted an office-remote hybrid, and the remaining 62% wanted to work from home all the time. Price followed up by letting the employee decide how they work.\nAgain, simple. Allowing employees to take ownership of their work environment isn\u2019t a difficult concept.\nIn my company, I think everyone benefits from remote work. But two sets of employees (those with children and introverts) stand out from everyone else.\nFirst, working from home allows more flexibility to spend more time with your children, take or not take a sick day, and save on childcare. Additionally, introverts don\u2019t want to drain their battery at work with nonsense small talk. If extroverts wish to go into the office to socialize (like me), they can. But don\u2019t take a one-size-fits-all approach.\nWhat job seekers should look for:\nStart with the job ad. In a labor shortage, companies need talent more than ever. So smart employers advertise remote opportunities in bold letters right in their job ad. If you have to guess about remote work, it\u2019s safe to say they aren\u2019t as flexible as you\u2019d like.\nWhat is a company\u2019s philosophy on remote work? If they only want you to work in the office, the chances of working remotely in the future are slim. Does the company have the training and technology to support its remote team members? If so, remote work is a more likely option. On the other hand, companies that refuse to build the infrastructure or invest in training are more comfortable bringing employees back in person.\nA good manager = a great mentor\nToo many people leave a company because of their manager rather than their job. A terrific manager will help mentor you when you\u2019re stressed out and encourage you to take time off. Additionally, a mentor carries enough experience to provide you with more value or training.\nMy friend joined a new company and hit the unlucky lottery. Her manager bullies her daily with comments like, \u201cYou don\u2019t know enough. You\u2019re not a fresh graduate. Why are you making any mistakes?\u201d\nKeep in mind, my friend\u2019s manager's job duties include quality control over all mid-level engineers. Instead, he\u2019s guilt-tripping her to do less work for him and at a much lower pay scale. The red flags existed in the interview, but she didn\u2019t have enough time to be picky after a layoff.\nMentors willingly want to share their knowledge and information with others. They\u2019re also eager to invest the time to train and support their employees.\nWhat job seekers should consider:\nRate your manager\u2019s professionalism. Examine any phone calls, email communications, or any other correspondence. For example, before I started my new job, I noticed the timely communication with my future manager. I asked for a few changes to my offer letter, and the updates came through within the hour.\nAs someone relocating for my career, my future manager emailed me to follow up on my move. Unexpected, but appreciated. I was honestly shocked that he even cared.\nUse any outside resources. If you know someone who worked at this company before, try to get in touch with them to get an insider\u2019s opinion. While they\u2019re not 100% accurate, reading Indeed or Glassdoor reviews can provide a glimpse of what your day-to-day will be like too.\nEmployers don\u2019t have to get all creative on why people aren\u2019t staying. They also should stop blaming unemployment and laziness. Instead, it\u2019s time to take accountability when you\u2019re not doing enough to keep employees happy.\nA quick recap on what the best companies do to retain talent:\nStart with the bread and butter (pay and benefits). I\u2019ve worked for companies that couldn\u2019t \u201cafford\u201d to offer competitive compensation and benefits. So they hired unpaid interns instead. Run if this sounds familiar.\nFlexibility creates an ideal environment. Humans need to enjoy life too. Flexibility can mean flexible start times, remote work availability, or even a simple work-life balance. It\u2019s not too much to ask.\nA good manager = a great mentor. My manager walked me through professional sessions such as how to terminate employees who receive client complaints. That\u2019s the obvious part. But I also learned personal milestones like how to buy a house in a tough market. And for that combo, I\u2019m forever grateful.\nPeople will stay in denial. But for those of us ready to move forward, it\u2019s time to embrace change.

At the end of the day, stress is change with a smiley face or a frowny face. But it\u2019s the frowny face that keeps us up at night. The negative stress floods our minds, so we can\u2019t fall asleep.\nI\u2019ve always been a firm believer in small steps. Any ounce of success or progress I\u2019ve made started with small actions rather than one significant change that changed my life forever. Micro-actions are underrated because they\u2019re unnoticeable at first glance. Nobody will notice the first time, not even ourselves. But intentional and incremental decisions can reduce your worrisome soul and stress all at once.\nHere are small but powerful micro-actions you can implement to practice a less stressful life.\n1. Time: Stretch The Time You Have\nStress often builds up pebble by pebble because you feel like you don\u2019t have enough time in a day.\nLess time and stress enter your life holding hands. When I feel stressed lying in bed at night, it\u2019s likely due to running out of time. I\u2019m snuggled up in bed but can't fully enjoy my slumber. So instead of drifting off to sleep, I\u2019m running through my mental checklist of what I didn\u2019t have time to do.\nResearchers have long lauded paying for time-saving services as a worthwhile alternative to buy back your time. A study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences suggests that when people spend money on time-saving services such as a house cleaner or lawn maintenance, they can feel much happier than material purchases. The researchers revealed the hidden benefits of spending money to buy free time.\nCompanies use this strategy all the time. Business owners hire new employees to delegate additional tasks to focus on their strengths or grow their business. So if companies do it, why can\u2019t we use the same mentality in our personal lives? Spending money on time-saving services helps provide a buffer against your time famine. It promotes your happiness and reduces your stress all in one go.\nAre you running out of time? Here\u2019s how you to stretch the time you have.\nAnother option to combat time scarcity is reimagining how you spend your time. Rearranging your schedule can do wonders for those who don\u2019t want to shell out more money. The best way to implement this is to strategically plan your day to avoid crowds.\nFor example, going grocery shopping at Costco and exercising at the gym are two of my favorite ways to destress. I get to do some retail therapy on essentials and work out my body to feel better. However, crowded places can get frustrating. Spending 30 minutes quickly takes 60 minutes as you\u2019re embroiled in a waiting game.\n2. Movement: Do a Simple Exercise\nMoving your body is easier than you think. Unfortunately, the mental blocks of not having enough time or feeling overwhelmed can feel difficult to overcome.\nFor example, my initial obstacle boiled down to time. Working in the office, suffering through a commute, and working long hours don\u2019t leave much time left. Most of my coworkers with kids share extra challenges where all they want at the end of the night is some peace and quiet. Even a Netflix show would be a treat.\nIt\u2019s also confusing for beginners to know where to start. Whether you\u2019re going to a personal trainer, on social media, or with your best friend, everyone shares their way the best way. It\u2019s difficult to navigate between those who swear by keto or any other diet. And the constant battle between cardio and weightlifting always pops up too.\nI established consistency by following the basics. And science supports this too. One of the best sources of movement you can rely on is walking in nature. According to a study, researchers found that walking in nature resulted in lower cortisol levels, thus decreasing stress. In addition, they concluded that walking in nature trumped walking on a treadmill as nature provided restorative effects over physical exercise alone.\nWalking in nature provides a sweet spot that can\u2019t be beaten. When my mind is overflowing with ideas, or I\u2019m stressed out from work, I opt for a simple walk. No equipment is needed. I put on an acceptable workout outfit (even straight from my work clothes) to slip on my shoes, and I\u2019m ready to go.\nHow can you find your simple exercise? Focus on accessibility.\nDetermine what is accessible and sustainable. That looks different for everyone. I love walking because I can do it daily in my neighborhood. It\u2019s also a low-impact exercise that I can perform even after a heavy lifting day in the gym. My wallet also enjoys this activity as it\u2019s relatively inexpensive compared to other pricey, cult-like gyms.\n3. Sleep: Wake Up 10 Minutes Earlier\nWaking up early at the crack of the dawn is an anomaly in the advice world. While research supports the benefits of early risers, it\u2019s important to analyze the why. I used to view waking up earlier as a productivity mantra not meant for me. But as I slowly started adjusting my schedule, I found my happy medium.\nWaking up ten minutes earlier than normal allowed me to clear my thoughts. Sometimes I wake up an hour earlier to get a workout in. I\u2019ll use the extra time to finish a blog post, go on a walk, or read a new romance novel. Morning routines are often celebrated as a necessary routine. But allowing flexibility in what you do each morning helps the rest of your day flourish.\nWaking up earlier alleviates your stress in multiple ways. Longitudinal research concludes that individuals who wake up earlier also tend to sleep earlier and enjoy a whole night\u2019s rest. It\u2019s likely why you\u2019re fully well-rested and automatically wake up when you sleep earlier but don\u2019t receive the same feeling when you sleep late.\nIn addition, researchers Ren\u00e9e K. Biss and Lynn Hasher from the University of Toronto published a study on how morning-type adults, or larks, experience a more positive effect than their counterparts who wake up later. Why do early risers see positive affect and health? The researchers discussed how morning-type individuals benefit from the alignment of societal expectations and their preferred times for activity. In contrast, typical school and work schedules that begin early in the day force night owls to wake earlier than their preferred time, which results in more stress and an overall sluggish day.\nHow can you make the most of your sleep? Focus on earlier.\nI didn\u2019t start waking up early for a 5 am productivity hack. It stemmed from necessity. I got a job working with clients three hours ahead of me and needed to start earlier. My productivity skyrocketed when I began working slightly earlier than my scheduled start time. I felt less stressed throughout the day.\nWaking up 10 minutes earlier allows me to plan for my day better. It\u2019s like reviewing the agenda before you head into a team meeting. This also gives me a cushion to start work early and finish later if I need to.\n4. Organization: Clean a Space to Make It Functional\nProcrastination is the thief of time. But it robs us of our efficiency because the end goal can be too overwhelming.\nA study published in the journal Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin measured how 60 individuals discussed their homes. The individuals found participants who described their living spaces as \u201ccluttered\u201d were or \u201crestful.\u201d Ultimately, researchers found that women with cluttered homes expressed higher levels of the stress hormone cortisol.\nAs I started working remotely full-time, I imagined my home as my sanctuary. I\u2019d utilized the kitchen more often that my in-office life. Therefore, it\u2019s more likely to be messier.\nDeep cleans are not my thing. It'll never happen if I put spring cleaning on my to-do list. However, mini cleans are my best friend.\nHow to get to a more organized you? Make spaces functional.\nIf I need to cook a meal, I do what I can to make my prep area functional. If my closet is overflowing with clothes, I\u2019ll clear out an entire trash bag to donate. On the other hand, sometimes I want to escape to my living room to lounge my evening away. Unfortunately, the random clothes and jackets flung on every pillow don\u2019t make that easy.\n5. Knowledge: Go To Bed Smarter\n\u201cGo to bed smarter than when you woke up.\u201d\n\u2014 Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway\nNever underestimate the power of reading. It\u2019s the best gateway to building up your knowledge with compound interest. In a world where people glue their eyes to their phones on a social media doom scroll, nestling up with a book can transform your mind.\nReading makes you more intelligent but also relaxes you \u2014 what a dynamic duo.\nA study highlighted in the Telegraph by the University of Sussex raised many participants\u2019 stress levels and then attempted to reduce them. Cognitive Neuropsychologist Dr. David Lewis found that reading worked best, reducing stress levels by 68 percent compared to listening to music (61%), drinking tea or coffee (54%), or taking a walk (42%). Reading reigned supreme as it only took 6 minutes for participants\u2019 stress levels to be reduced.\nA good book distracts your mind from daily stresses or worries, thus reducing your stress levels. Stories provide a much-needed escape for your mind. Consequently, you can leave your troubles behind and allow your entire body to relax, leaving you in a calmer state than minutes before.\nOver the past year, I incorporated reading into my routine. My favorite time to read is before bed, when I can wind down my brain. When I feel my eyes droop, I know it\u2019s time to store the book away and sleep.\nHow can you go to bed brighter? Find your book equivalent.\nIn addition to reading, I wanted to branch out and try something new in 2022. So I signed up for Duolingo to build up my fluency in Vietnamese. Born in the United States to Vietnamese immigrants, my parents decided to make me fluent in English when they weren\u2019t themselves. As a result, I never learned how to read or write in Vietnamese. My broken Vietnamese resembles a singer who can\u2019t read music but sings by ear.\nSince I started five minutes or more of studying Vietnamese, I\u2019ve learned a few odd things here and there. For example, I slowly recognized how to spell words besides my favorite dishes on a menu. And it\u2019s five minutes of studying that build up over time.\nBook equivalents I\u2019ve loved are watching informational YouTube videos or listening to podcasts. But, it doesn\u2019t matter what type of medium you learn from. The action of self-improvement means way more.\nFinal Thoughts\nA quick recap:\n1. Time: Stretch the time you have. Look at what takes longer than it should in your schedule, then adjust.\n2. Movement: Do a simple exercise. When you\u2019re too busy deciding, opt for a default workout. Walking is my go-to.\n3. Sleep: Wake up 10 minutes earlier. Most people don\u2019t need to wake up at the crack of the dawn. But everyone would benefit from waking up a little earlier than they need to. The extra time is yours to spend.\n4. Organization: Clean a space to make it functional. Deep cleans require extended time and labor. A mini clean each day will relax you at the end of each night.\n5. Knowledge: Go To Bed Smarter. I love a good book, but numerous book equivalents exist.

Some employers are returning to their old ways, announcing a specific date for their employees to return to work. If employees don\u2019t like it, they can quit or take a pay cut.\nUS News called this movement \u201cThe Great Return.\u201d So what will happen when companies call their employees back into the office?\nMy prediction is that those with a hybrid structure may do fine. However, any company that requires a 100% in-office requirement will suffer a competitive disadvantage. In addition, these decisions on the heels of allowing remote work for two years won\u2019t sit well with employees.\nAnd a rigid in-office structure will make the jobs harder for company recruiters. As a result, the battle for talent is more significant than ever before. The only reason my company has a chance to secure talent is by offering remote work. Otherwise, we\u2019d be dead in the water.\nAs a human resources professional, my last month passed in a blur. Things have shifted. While I\u2019ve encountered exceptional candidates interested in our positions, we\u2019re in the midst of a counteroffer battle.\nEmployees and applicants possess more power than ever before. The ball is in their court. This explains why in 2022, my hiring challenges have felt like running on a hamster wheel. We\u2019ve had employees start at our company and continue interviewing their first week. Then, they hand in their resignation days later and disappear for $1/hr more.\nOr the telltale sign of a candidate interviewing to leverage our compensation at their current company. The best way to get a raise is to interview and gauge what the market offers, right?\nBut there\u2019s a saving grace to this madness for employers. And it\u2019s remote work. Companies announcing the return to work at the office create a fantastic window of opportunity for other employers. Corporations willing to forego the traditional working method and adapt to the future will always come out ahead.\nMany of my friends ask me if I think remote work is here to stay. My answer is yes.\nEven if employers want to return to normal (everyone making a dreaded commute to a cubicle office), the perception of work has already shifted. The damage, or in this case, the benefits happened. And it\u2019s too late to turn back. Additionally, perks exist for both companies and employees. So it\u2019s not as one-sided to benefit lazy employees as executives may think.\nHere\u2019s how remote work is the best-recruiting strategy for employers.\nAdvertises work-life balance as a priority\nActions speak louder than words, right? So a company claiming they care about work-life balance is much different than a company implementing a remote arrangement.\nAccording to a recent FlexJobs survey of more than 4,000 respondents working from home in response to the coronavirus, 73% said that working from home improved their work-life balance.\nAs a recruiter, that\u2019s one of the most common reasons people leave their jobs. It\u2019s indirectly tied to management. People are reluctant to say they\u2019re working under a terrible manager. Instead, they\u2019ll give the \u201cprofessional\u201d answer of wanting a better work-life balance, so they\u2019re not working 60\u201370 hours per week.\nWhen companies explain that they offer remote work (even if it\u2019s a hybrid), they say multiple things.\nCut down commute time. Whether your previous commute was five minutes or an hour, everyone saves time working remotely. A ten-step commute is always better than braving the traffic.\nWe can manage remotely. Remote companies don\u2019t need managers to manage you physically. These employers are confident and have the tools in place to work remotely. It\u2019s nice not to have a micromanager breathing over your shoulder.\nMore sleep, anyone? This is my favorite. I\u2019ve noticed my health improve after I can squeeze in an extra hour of sleep every night. Also, I\u2019m less tired when I start work and am generally in a happier mood.\nCompanies had two years to figure this out. And employers should know how to do it well. But unfortunately, some employees work more hours on a remote arrangement because their employers constantly check in on them with meetings.\nAnother benefit to work-life balance is spending more time with family. We can see this in getting time to eat meals together as a family. But there\u2019s another significant time when working remotely is necessary: when someone welcomes a newborn into the world.\nA 2015 study found that women experienced lower levels of depression when they could work remotely instead of heading back into the office. Staying home with your newborn child reduces your stress levels. Employees don\u2019t have to stress sending their baby to daycare right away as they\u2019re in the next room working from home.\nMy company is female-dominant. We have employees going on maternity leave every year, even within our small company. And remote work allows our female employees to experience a smooth transition on returning to work.\nWhy it\u2019s here to stay:\nRemote work is the best thing employers can include in a job ad. It\u2019s a great tool to attract employees.\nIn my experience, a few main things attract candidates. My top 3 include:\nA posted pay range (nobody wants to guess their pay)\nGood benefits (nobody wants to worry about health insurance)\nRemote work (it\u2019s the way of the present and future)\nEmployers expand their candidate pool\nWhen an employer posts a temporarily remote job, they access a bigger applicant pool. But when a company posts a fully remote opportunity, applicants come flooding.\nMike Kiley, Fortune\u2019s SVP of HR & Talent, acknowledged that \u201cWe were putting ourselves at a competitive disadvantage by not hiring more remote workers. If you say [a job] is New York-only, you\u2019re limiting who you can hire.\u201d\nOpening job postings to applicants all around the country increases the number of qualified applicants per opening.\nSince my company scrapped our mandatory in-office meetings, I can\u2019t keep up with the candidates we\u2019re getting. It\u2019s an excellent problem to have. Most applicants will apply within the first week, and I\u2019ve gotten over a hundred applicants over the weekend compared to the typical ten.\nIt\u2019s not just the quantity but the quality. We\u2019re receiving 10x more qualified candidates than before. Candidates came from different markets who were ecstatic to receive our advertised pay.\nThere\u2019s also a side effect. Employers may go to smaller markets for talent rather than relying on people who ask for a lot of money to keep up with their cost of living.\nIntelligent companies would instead open up their candidate pool than demand a return to the office strategy.\nWhy it\u2019s here to stay:\nRemoving geographic boundaries may mean more initial work for recruiters or hiring managers. I do have to spend a lot more time reviewing candidates than before.\nBut the payoff is there. There are more applicants to choose from and, therefore, more talent to select.\nIt helps employees save in big, bold letters\nRemote work saves employees a lot of money, especially in a climate where gas prices skyrocket. Working from home also provides more flexibility in how you structure your day.\nWhen I sat down and crunched my numbers, I realized that I quickly saved $400 per month thanks to remote work. I started pumping gas once a month rather than once a week. My car insurance plummeted. But it was also the little things that started adding up: buying less food, purchasing fewer clothes for a business casual wardrobe, and saving money on travel.\nBut most important, remote work allows employees to buy back their time. Not suffering through a commute means people can devote those extra hours to whatever their heart desires. Over the past two years, I\u2019ve dedicated my spare commute time to activities I claimed I never had enough time to do, like exercising. But I also poured my energy into working on my side hustles to create multiple income streams.\nInstead of employees struggling to live paycheck to paycheck, they start conversations about buying houses and starting families. The main reason for this change is that more people can afford to make these big life decisions.\nWhy it\u2019s here to stay:\nIt\u2019s not just employees who can benefit. Employers are saving money too.\nAccording to Global Workplace Analytics, a typical employer can save about $11,000 a year for every person who works remotely 50% of the time. This remote work lifestyle is a win-win situation from increased productivity, reduced turnover, and fewer real estate costs.\nFinal Thoughts\nA quick recap on how remote work is here to stay as a company\u2019s best-recruiting strategy:\nAdvertises work-life balance as a priority. Applicants breathe a sigh of relief when I confirm the position is remote. They know they can escape the grind of a grueling commute and unproductive face time at the office.\nEmployers expand their candidate pool. Allowing employees to work remotely means you can select talent that you were limited to before. Companies embracing remote work will see an increase in the quantity and quality of applicants.\nIt says we want you to save in big, bold letters. Remote work feels like a pay raise. Because it is. Your expenses go down, and you can invest those savings (financial and time) to bigger and better things.\nThe tide is turning with employers announcing a return back to the office. I get excited with these announcements because it means my company can poach its employees.\nWhy not offer a win-win situation for everyone with remote work?

My first full-time job out of college offered a work-from-home benefit. And while it sounds great on paper, my subpar experience led me to evolve into a remote skeptic.\nYears later, I found myself working remotely again. Although this time, I worked for a great company. Thus, I turned into a remote work advocate.\nI saw the transition with my two eyes. Employees grew more rested and smiled more, knowing they could sleep in without commuting. In addition, their finances took a turn for the better with savings on gas and insurance.\nBut the best value is when employees save time. The time that they can buy back and devote to whatever their heart desires \u2014 more family time, finding a hobby, or taking care of their health.\nAs someone who worked remotely in multiple jobs and the past two years, reaching remote work bliss isn\u2019t an easy journey.

It\u2019s the arrangement everyone loves until they feel that itch. And that itch means you\u2019re still not satisfied. It takes longer to realize when compared to a regular in-office job where you\u2019re always thinking about how the grass is greener on the other side.\nAfter working remotely multiple times, I\u2019ve learned how to avoid the common remote work traps that will eventually plague us work from homers. Here\u2019s how you can avoid them, too and come out on top.\n1. Pay: accepting less money\nWe\u2019re seeing two types of pay cuts.\nFirst, companies that allow employees to work from anywhere instead of returning to the office are announcing pay cuts.\nLast year, tech companies like Google announced a pay cut for remote employees. Depending on how far employees work from their office, pay cuts could result in a 25% pay decrease. Companies even compiled remote pay calculators to determine the percentage of each employee's pay cut. It seems to be a growing trend \u2014 work remotely, and you get a pay cut.\nAnd that\u2019s an acceptable solution for some employees. According to a Breeze survey, 65% of Americans would be willing to take a pay cut of up to 5% to work remotely full-time. However, that number drastically drops to 15% when a 25% pay cut is involved.\nIt\u2019s not a simple pay cut that has people up in arms. Most employees find it reasonable that relocating to a different state with a lower cost of living would mean a pay cut. However, when the pay cut reaches a substantial amount, it detracts from an employee\u2019s raises and promotions. It\u2019s like a slap in the face \u2014 your past four years of work didn\u2019t matter.\nWhen my friend relocated to Texas for her consulting job, her company tried a different approach. They kept her pay the same. But moving forward, her pay scale would differ from the California employees.\nIn the world of compensation, market-rate determines pay. And that\u2019s valid. Companies have to offer a competitive salary considering the cost of living in that area. But this compensation strategy existed before remote work took the world by storm. And there\u2019s no perfect strategy that will please every employee or corporation.\nThe second type of pay cut is the self-inflicted one.\nAnother thing I heard is candidates admitting they\u2019re willing to accept less money for remote work. When I ask candidates for their desired compensation, they\u2019ll quickly mention their salary range is negotiable because the position is remote.\nOffering less pay for remote work is also the strategy my previous employer used. They rationalized that I\u2019d harbor so many savings with me working from home. It would be the equivalent of at least a 5% raise!\nDon\u2019t make my mistake. While it financially makes sense, candidates shouldn't reveal all their cards.\nHow to avoid the pay cut trap:\nDon\u2019t be afraid to negotiate. In this employee-driven market, companies lose much more when replacing upset employees. So many employers are now offering remote work. Ask for what you want or start your job search.\nAs an HR professional, companies typically base compensation on what the market pays. The highest cost of living areas means higher salaries. That\u2019s why companies in San Francisco must pay more to retain better talent while employers in rural areas can get away with much less. Simple.\n2. Burnout: working too many hours\nStudies demonstrate that remote workers are putting in more hours despite the flexibility remote work offers.\nFor example, a new study from Nature Human Behavior found that remote workers spent 10% longer logged in each week. You might benefit from no commute, but that means you\u2019re quickly transforming a regular 40-hour workweek into a 44-hour workweek.\nAnd more hours logged in doesn\u2019t always translate to more productivity.\nAnother survey on the remote work habits of 10,000 employees at an Asian technology company between April 2019 and August 2020 found a 20 percent decrease in output. The drop in productivity wasn\u2019t because of lazy employees. Instead, employees spent extra hours in unnecessary meetings with their managers to constantly update their responsibilities.\nWith our marching orders determined, our management reduced the company\u2019s meetings. We still have our 1x1 meetings and team meetings, but due to necessity rather than routine. Each meeting brings together better ideas instead of a 30-minute interruption to our workflow.\nHow to avoid the working too many hours trap:\nFocus on efficiency instead of hours. Don\u2019t get pulled into unnecessary meetings. I get how you may not have control over required meetings your manager makes mandatory. But ask about the purpose of any meetings you\u2019re invited to, and if your attendance isn\u2019t necessary, state that it looks like you won\u2019t be able to contribute to the value of the meeting.\nDesign the optimal working space. While it can be fun to work from your bed, it\u2019s essential to separate home and work. I designed my separate working space with a standing desk, chair, and monitor setup. Once I close my office door when logging off, I don\u2019t go back in until the following day.\n3. Social: not connecting with your team\nCommunicating and connecting with your colleagues is more difficult when you\u2019re not in the same physical space.\nNew hires experience a different level \u2014 they don\u2019t even recognize anyone. So my company makes sure we send out announcements with a brief bio and a picture of our new team member upon hire. This also makes it less awkward when we host a company party.\nEven though our company possesses the tools to video chat and communicate online, some people still lack human interaction. As a result, I do video calls with all my team members. And I don\u2019t expect anyone to look like a model. Showing up in no makeup and glasses is my uniform. I also don\u2019t expect my colleagues to turn on their cameras if they feel uncomfortable. But I can hear their voice relax when they see my face pop up.\nThen there\u2019s the problem with only relying on email. People can quickly misjudge a tone in an email. Also, especially unfamiliar colleagues, you can read too much into a simple sentence.\nHow to avoid the lack of social interaction trap:\nPlan a time to go into the office. My day to go into the office is Wednesday. That\u2019s when I know the majority of my team would be there. This is when we reunite for lunch at our favorite local spot and catch up. Also, I\u2019m always available in the office when we onboard new hires. This ensures our new hires have a friendly face and touchpoint rather than just learning their new job remotely.\nEncourage your team members to pick up the phone. There\u2019s something special about hearing someone\u2019s voice. And it\u2019s nice to talk about things in depth rather than typing out a monologue in your TEAMS chat or responding to a neverending email chain.\n4. Bad habits: No commute = sleeping into the last second\nWhen I first started working remotely full-time, I loved sleeping in. But eventually, I realized a commute had its perks. It allowed me time to listen to my favorite songs or podcasts. It gave me time to unwind, and by the time I arrived at the office, I wasn\u2019t trying to respond to emails with my eyelids half-open.\nI\u2019m notorious for waking up a little five minutes before I start work to squeeze in as much sleep as I can. So when my manager recommended everyone who transitions to work remotely still have a morning routine, I felt attacked. He knew I wasn\u2019t a morning person at all. However, I\u2019ve realized I can get more done simply by waking up 30\u201345 minutes before my start time, even when my commute is five steps away.\nHere are some of the morning rituals I do to make my mornings easier:\nJot down content ideas\nMake my coffee\nPut on makeup (when I\u2019m conducting interviews)\nStretch and get myself energized for the day\nHow to avoid this trap:\nAdjust your sleeping schedule. I've adjusted my sleeping schedule despite my desire to stay up with my night owl tendencies. Going to sleep an hour earlier makes a world of difference. My mornings are less groggy, and I can start work earlier or pump out content on the weekends.\nGive yourself a different type of commute. I\u2019m so thankful I don\u2019t have to spend more money on gas or the wear and tear on my car. Instead, I \u201ccommute\u201d downstairs to wake myself up each morning with my favorite coffee.\n5. Productivity: getting distracted\nFor some, productivity suffers at home. For others, it skyrockets. One of my mentors is introverted, and she thrives working remotely. Without all the small talk about the weather, she\u2019s able to manage her schedule like a pro.\nWe don't have to be in tip-top productivity all the time. But working from home brings distractions galore. I\u2019m tempted to do a few chores around the house. While some can be done without interrupting my job, other things like kids clamoring for attention while you\u2019re on a video call or more difficult to overcome.\nOn the other hand, some distractions that I\u2019ve encountered involve people contacting me during working hours instead of after. They assume I won\u2019t get in trouble if I answer their call and chat about who knows what. My parents are truly guilty of this.\nHow to avoid the distraction trap:\nCreate a schedule that works for both your professional and personal life.\nMy coworkers with kids have flexibility in their mornings when they drop off their children at daycare. When the afternoon rolls around, and their kids are loud, they\u2019ll be on mute for any calls if they can help it. These are the same coworkers who are super productive when their kids are in daycare or at school because they know they have a shorter window than an 8-hour day to get their work done.\nFinal Thoughts\nA quick recap on how to avoid the most common remote work traps:\n1. Pay: accepting less money. Negotiate with your employer if a pay cut for remote work is on the horizon. If you\u2019re on the job search, keep this sentiment to yourself and ask for what you deserve (regardless of whether it\u2019s remote or not).\n2. Burnout: working too many hours. Working from home makes it easy to continue work beyond regular hours. Create a line of separation to be the most efficient you.\n3. Social: not connecting with your team. Plan to meet up with your colleagues in person when you\u2019re craving in-person interaction. Pick up the phone to resolve matters quickly instead of getting stuck in email chain quicksand.\n4. Bad Habits: no commute = sleeping into the last second. I\u2019m the ultimate snoozer. But I still have to admit doing your thoughtful morning routine beats waking up, brushing your teeth, and logging in within a few minutes.\n5. Productivity: getting distracted.

In this series, we speak with women of the IWMF community who are on the ground reporting on this conflict.\nThe following interview features inaugural Anja Niedringhaus Courage in Photojournalism Awardee Heidi Levine, who has captured the human realities of war for more than three decades. This interview was conducted March 17, 2022.\nc/o Heidi Levine\nWhat was your journey like getting into Ukraine and how have things changed since you arrived?\nMy journey into Ukraine was simple: I left Israel on February 20th and had a direct flight to Kyiv. The journey out, whenever that will be, is a lot more complicated \u2014 the airport isn\u2019t functioning, so instead of just getting back to Israel in a few hours, it\u2019s probably going to take a few days. And with a lot more safety concerns about the journey.\nPC: Heidi Levine on Instagram\nOne of the major differences is that when I left and was en route to Ukraine, I had hope that somehow this war wouldn\u2019t start \u2014 because it hadn\u2019t started yet.\nBut within just four days the war broke out. Now, all that hope is gone.\nWhat is the biggest challenge facing journalists \u2014 particularly women journalists \u2014 covering this conflict?\nThere are a lot of things to think about that are quite different in comparison to the previous wars I\u2019ve covered. We have a chance of a Third World War, we have a chance of Russia using nuclear weapons or chemical weapons, damaging the nuclear power plants here. Since the war started, it\u2019s obvious that civilians are being targeted. All the coverage I\u2019ve done on any of the missile strikes have been on residential civilian neighborhoods.\nPC: Heidi Levine on Instagram\nThree journalists were killed in the last several days. And before that, the Sky News team that came under gunfire. Traveling around is an extreme security concern for all of us [journalists]. Anyone working with security teams is being advised not to go too far. I was covering Irpin and then the day after, a journalist tried to get in and was killed, and several were wounded. Things are changing so quickly on the ground that an area may be completely unsafe just a few hours later or the next day.\nWhat story or moment has made the biggest impression on you while reporting on the conflict?\nI\u2019ve never seen such an exodus of people fleeing in my life. I was just horrified seeing so many people fleeing with their animals, their cats, dogs. The elderly are being pushed in wheelchairs or carried or even on stretchers \u2014 in freezing weather, in the snow.\nIt\u2019s hard to believe we are actually in the year 2022, because it\u2019s like a d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu of World War II.\nI tried to help one elderly woman to warm her hands and her shirt was up and her stomach was exposed. I pulled her shirt down and I saw she was wearing geriatric diapers. Also, let\u2019s not forget that COVID is also up now because of the war. People are worried about dying of COVID and dying from the war. This is just inhumane.\nPC: Heidi Levine on Instagram\nIs there anything you wish the global community outside of the region knew about this conflict, or what journalists are going through?\n[The realities have] been on TV, it\u2019s on the news. I think somehow, something has to be done \u2014 because if it\u2019s not done now, it means that this can happen again.\nOn a positive note, I\u2019ve never seen like people like the Ukrainians come together in every way. Everyone is willing to fight for their country, whether it\u2019s with a weapon or making food to share with their neighbors or feed the forces fighting.\nEveryone in one way or another is coming together because they\u2019re not going to give up.", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 15, "created_time": 1649258198912, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Ukraine", "Photography", "Journalism", "Russia", "Women In Media"]}, {"author": "IWMF", "post_id": "206f20a102ff", "user_id": "46b65f03eb19", "title": "On the ground in Ukraine: Photojournalist Nicole Tung", "content": "On the ground in Ukraine: Photojournalist Nicole Tung\nJournalists are undertaking immense risk to help the world bear witness to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.

I was very lucky because I found a train that went from Warsaw all the way to Kyiv \u2014 a 16-hour train ride. On that train there were mostly Ukrainian men who were living abroad and trying to get back into the country to join the [defense] effort.\nc/o Nicole Tung on Instagram\nI\u2019ve been here for over two weeks now, and I\u2019ve stayed in Kyiv the whole time. I would say the biggest change is that there\u2019s now a lot more targeting of residential areas in the city itself.\nThe danger level is now much, much higher.\nWhat is the biggest challenge facing journalists \u2014 particularly women journalists \u2014 covering this conflict?\nAs foreign journalists, the main challenge aside from the level of danger has been access. I\u2019m not even speaking of military-related things to photograph, but just trying to photograph checkpoints and bunkers or shelters where people are taking refuge is difficult unless there\u2019s an organized press tour. It\u2019s been pretty challenging.\nFor me, there really hasn\u2019t been anything particularly gender related that has been a challenge, but there are so few women here on the ground. That said, there are a lot of Ukrainian female journalists who are doing an amazing job of covering this conflict. Seeing their home country under bombardment and the suffering that people are going through is incredibly difficult \u2014 having to report on it at the same time must be tenfold.\nWhat story or moment has made the biggest impression on you while reporting on the conflict?\nThere have been a lot. One is seeing a husband and wife who were saying goodbye to each other at the train station in Irpin, near Kyiv. The mother or the wife was holding their 11-month-old baby and they were talking through the fence at the railway station. It was an incredibly emotional moment because he couldn\u2019t leave the country. So the wife \u2013Yana \u2014 was going take their son and flee, probably to Poland.\nc/o Nicole Tung on Instagram\nThe gentleness of this moment, of them not knowing if they\u2019re going to see each other again, really took my breath away. It was heartbreaking to watch. I felt compelled to photograph it, but also wanted to them to have their moment together, their last kiss before she boarded the train.\nThese very human moments are what stick with me, and the uncertainty that surrounds people in those moments.\nIs there anything you wish the global community outside of the region knew about this conflict, or what journalists are going through?\nPeople should know that the resolve of the Ukrainian people is incredibly strong. Not one person is not doing something \u2014 everybody is pitching in, no one\u2019s just sitting at home. There are grandmothers who are out there cooking food for troops and civilians. Everyone\u2019s doing their little part.\nc/o Nicole Tung on Instagram\nAs for what journalists are going through, it\u2019s really the physical danger and of course, the psychological trauma that especially Ukrainian journalists are going through. But the physical threats are real for every journalist right now because it\u2019s so unpredictable.\nTrying to cover this war, where things are happening in many different places and with a very advanced Russian military can be, as we\u2019ve seen, fatal.", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 275, "created_time": 1648484067761, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Ukraine", "Journalism", "Russia", "Photography", "Women In Media"]}, {"author": "IWMF", "post_id": "91da4540e5b3", "user_id": "46b65f03eb19", "title": "Q&A with #IWMFGrantees Joana Moncau and Elpida Nikou", "content": "Q&A with #IWMFGrantees Joana Moncau and Elpida Nikou\nThe Fund for Women Journalists grantees\u2019 new documentary \u201cAmazon Messengers\u201d shows the indigenous Munduruku people\u2019s resistance to destruction and deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon.\nThe Munduruku Daje Kapap Eypi Audiovisual Collective interviews the Munduruku chief\nIWMF: What led you to this story? How have your journalistic backgrounds prepared you to cover this issue?\nJoana and Elpida: For more than 10 years we have been covering human rights, socio-environmental issues and indigenous populations in Brazil and several other countries. Currently, we both form part of the audiovisual cooperative Muzungu Productions.\nElpida has worked on numerous news programs, reportages and short documentaries in the Middle East, Africa and Latin America for Al Jazeera, National Geographic, The New York Times, Telesur and many others. And Joana has covered many topics related to indigenous populations in Brazil for media such as Rep\u00f3rter Brasil, Ag\u00eancia P\u00fablica, Le Monde Diplomatique Brasil, AJ+ among others. This experience helped us to cover this topic.\nYou worked closely with the Munduruku videography team on this project. What was valuable about working alongside the Munduruku community to tell their story?\nWorking in partnership with Coletivo Audiovisual Munduruku Daje Kapap Eypi was essential for the documentary we made. This collective has been recording the struggle of the Munduruku people since 2015 and has a vast and valuable archive of images. These images give strength to the denunciations made by the Munduruku people and to what these people are willing to face in their resistance. They also give strength to our documentary. As Aldira Akai, one of the members of the audiovisual collective, put it well:\n\u201cPeople no longer believe only in people\u2019s words, they believe in what they see\u201d.\nThe Munduruku Daje Kapap Eypi Audiovisual Collective at work editing\nWhat were the biggest challenges you faced while reporting?\nThe main challenges were access to the territory, due to the pandemic, and the safety of the leaders that we were initially going to follow because of the threats they have been suffering. With the beginning of the pandemic and the first years of Bolsonaro\u2019s government, the situation has changed a lot.\nPresident Bolsonaro\u2019s favorable nods to the invaders of indigenous lands have raised the threats to leaders who fight these illegal activities to an unprecedented level.\nMiners, loggers, land grabbers who invade indigenous territories have never felt so safe, according to reports from the very leaders who face these practices.\nTo preserve the safety of these leaders, we shifted the focus of our documentary to the Munduruku Daje Kapap Eypi Audiovisual Collective. Recording the daily life of the audiovisual collective working in its community and reviewing its archive images was no major challenge. However, it is worth mentioning that the Munduruku Audiovisual Collective exposed itself to numerous risk situations when recording the mobilizations of the Munduruku people to expel invaders \u2014 miners and loggers \u2014 from their territories, images that were used in our documentary.\nc/o Munduruku Daje Kapap Eypi Audiovisual Collective\nWhat surprised you most about this story? Were there any unexpected narratives that arose during filming?\nWhat surprised me the most was the strength and determination of these three young women who make up the Munduruku Daje Kapap Eypi Audiovisual Collective. They are determined to strengthen this front of action and are clear about the importance of what they do.\nStraight from the heart of the Amazon rainforest, in a community of fewer than 200 people, they manage to echo the denunciations and the voice of the leaders of their people to the world. The potential and relevance of this collective, touched by the new generation, is admirable and positively surprising.\nMunduruku Daje Kapap Eypi Audiovisual Collective member Rilcelia Akai\nHow does this documentary continue the fight for indigenous sovereignty and land rights in Brazil? What happens next for these communities?\nThe struggle of indigenous peoples in defense of the territory and the Amazon rainforest in Brazil is uninterrupted and is currently the main front of resistance to deforestation and large projects that could destroy the Amazon and its peoples.\nThe rights that Indigenous peoples from all regions of Brazil, not just the Amazon, had won are being harshly threatened in Congress.\nAnd, in the territory, they are suffering more and more pressure. These peoples are opening other fronts to defend themselves, such as communication.\nc/o Munduruku Daje Kapap Eypi Audiovisual Collective\nOur documentary helps to show the resistance of one of these peoples, the Munduruku people, as well as the struggle in the territory and the heroic effort of the Munduruku audiovisual collective to make denouncements that only those who are in the territory can make. From this communication work, the Munduruku obtain allies and support, essential for their resistance.\nIn the current political context that we are experiencing in Brazil, continuing to strengthen these initiatives will be increasingly important and the international community has a fundamental role to play in supporting these initiatives and passing on these complaints.\nWe hope that this documentary will help to echo even more the resistance of these people and the work of the Coletivo Audiovisual Munduruku Daje Kapap Eypi, because what follows for these communities is even more struggle and, certainly, more threats.", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 0, "created_time": 1643745228270, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Journalism", "Indigenous", "Climate Action"]}, {"author": "Prof Bill Buchanan OBE", "post_id": "d3815f25a455", "user_id": "e680fcaf274b", "title": "Using YubiKey to Protect Email With MFA", "content": "My YubiKey\nUsing YubiKey to Protect Email With MFA\nElectronic mail has been around for over 40 years, and we still have not managed to properly secure it.

So, let\u2019s use it to understand how Ethereum uses its keys and signs for messages. Overall, we use public-key encryption and which uses the elliptic curve that Satoshi Nakamoto selected for Bitcoin: secp256k1. With this, we have a random private key of 32 bytes (256 bits). If we run our local blockchain with Ganache, it will show us a number of account addresses:\n\nThis is a public identifier for each user. Underneath this is a private key, and which should not be exposed to anyone:\n\nThis private key is used to sign for transactions and has an associated public key. The conversion of the private address to a public address is to perform an ECDSA signature, and then take a hash of this with Keccak-256. The address is the first 40 bytes of this signature:\n\nThe great thing about this public address is that the public key can be easily extracted from the identifier. This allows everyone to check the signature on a transaction. In the following, we use Node.js to generate a private key, and then sign for a message [here]:\n\nWe generate a random 32 byte key with:\nconst privateKey = crypto.randomBytes(32).toString(\"hex\");\nAnd then generate the public key and the address from:\nconst publicKey = EthCrypto.publicKeyByPrivateKey(privateKey);\nconst address = EthCrypto.publicKey.toAddress(publicKey);\nNext, we can take a message, and generate a hash of this, and then generate a signature. This requires the private key of the user:\nconst hash = EthCrypto.hash.keccak256 ([{type: \"string\", value: message},]);\nconst signature = EthCrypto.sign(privateKey, hash);\nWe can check the public key of a signer by recovering it from the signature and the hash of the message:\nconst signer = EthCrypto.recoverPublicKey(signature, hash);\nFinally we can check the signature, by recovering the identity of the signer:\nconst senderAddress = EthCrypto.recover(signature,hash);\nAnd that\u2019s basically it for keys and signatures in Ethereum. A sample run is [here]:\nPrivate key: 2b6ceaa26d40398a5d4072fc255d2582335ddbc9d0db1cd8c721f485395407c4\nPublic key: be3335c09520a160bd3fc2faed453be39cea34dbbd4b131eff25160eb78ba28d4c08a314d19fc9579f9dee164e25784990333f2dd7c1ddace41e04cff0b49a8a\nSigner address 0x669654868972029F1Bd75c1b5a7A2cB42Dcd70E3\nMessage: Test\nHash: 0x85cc825a98ec217d960f113f5f80a95d7fd18e3725d37df428eb14f880bdfc12\nSignature: 0xd82f3bef84da99d909d973b3caf37231e4db97ec606ba2f0f6ac820b61c86d1741cc7fbe92fc145d59d14d73a9465437b2ee1a2f50018be839256013a6be231c1b\n--- Now checking signature ---\nPublic key recovered: be3335c09520a160bd3fc2faed453be39cea34dbbd4b131eff25160eb78ba28d4c08a314d19fc9579f9dee164e25784990333f2dd7c1ddace41e04cff0b49a8a\nSender (recovered): 0x669654868972029F1Bd75c1b5a7A2cB42Dcd70E3\nNow we will encrypt ...\nCipher:  {\n  iv: '26dab379573738a107fa3150b037f79b',\n  ephemPublicKey: '047329eb00a6787a3e13321b9894db3c00539d3cf14fc685acdd7bebab5e22457f35494d461f0664c070fd8a86914ab67626cdc8cb61431184405d0a0d99e52eef',\n  ciphertext: '0b9eb5c69899c912bc198b843bea930f',\n  mac: 'ae430fdeb89c4d6e2ac6344de95138b0cd361ad7cf9383c9747c64bb778c49cd'\n}\nDecryption:  Test\nIsn\u2019t ECDSA just magic?\nA running demo is here:\nhttps://asecuritysite.com/ethereum/js_ethereum\nAnd on Repl.it:\nethnew01\nConnect with the world!

Our systems are often set up to store sensitive information on us, and where we also pass this sensitive information through our applications. But, there is another way, and that\u2019s the creation of Non-interactive Zero Knowledge Proofs (NI-ZKP). These magical little functions allow us to prove that we know something secret and give cryptographic proof for it.\nSo let\u2019s take an example, and where Peggy has a secret value of x, and that Victor has stored a hash value such that:\ny=H(x)\nIf Victor uses a 256-bit hash, there is virtually no chance that we will ever discover the value of x, with just the knowledge of y. x could thus be Peggy\u2019s password, or my National Insurance number. It could even be the proof of a given 256-bit encryption key.\nSo let\u2019s see if we can prove x with a knowledge of H(x), and run in a smart contract. As the smart contract can expose values, we need to keep the value of x secret. For this, we turn to Zokrates and Solidity.\nZokrates\nZKPs have been around since the mid-1980s, and have often been heavy in terms of their processing requirements. One new family has come along, though, and which provides fast and short proofs. This is zkSnark (zero-knowledge Succinct Non-interactive ARguments of Knowledge). Overall, zkSnarks have been used in applications of privacy-preserving cryptocurrency, but have applications within smart contracts, too. Normally we require a proof to be done using an off-chain method, but the zkSnarks now allows us to prove things on-chain \u2014 and in an efficient and low-cost way. As a result, we can create our off-chain applications, and then link them into the Ethereum blockchain for a proof.\nOne of the quickest ways to produce these proofs is to use Zokrates, and which can plug into Remix:\n\nThis code can then be compiled into Solidity code. The code to hash a value is given next:\nimport \"hashes/sha256/512bitPacked\" as sha256packed\ndef main(private field a, private field b, private field c, private field d, field h0, field h1):\nfield[2] h = sha256packed([a, b, c, d])\nassert(h[0] == h0)\nassert(h[1] == h1)\nreturn\n// Input: 'a' -> 0,0,0,97\n// assert(h[0] == 45324487246557938747332883189457400843)\n// assert(h[1] == 84478852209878349000735790184433475398)\nIn Socrates we can only hold 128-bit values, and so our 256-bit hash is split into two parts. In this case h[0] for the lower 128 bits, and h[1] for the upper 128 bits. For the input data, we split into four 128-bit values, and which gives us a data input of up to 512 bits. The values of the input will be a, b, c and d, and where d is the end part of the data buffer. With many other cryptosystems, we use a big-endian format, and where the last byte as the first byte of the data. Thus for a data input of \u2018a\u2019, and for 16 bytes (128 bits), we end up with a hex value of:\n00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 61\nand where \u201861\u2019 is the hex value for an \u2018a\u2019. This is a value of 97 as an integer value.\nWith this, we have four private fields: a, b, c and d. These will be kept private to the smart contract, and will not be exposed, while h0 and h1 (the hash value) can be revealed:\ndef main(private field a, private field b, private field c, private field d, field h0, field h1):\nWe will thus create a zero-knowledge proof for a, b, c and d and which relates to the hash values of h0 and h1. For the next part, we now need to compute a witness within the compiled program and which has the valid values computed. For this, we need to generate the values of h0 and h1 for the hash. So let\u2019s take an into of \u20180x000\u2026.a\u2019 and then compute the two input hash values (h0 and h1):\n\nThe run of this is:\nhx:  22192dc09ba3afbc0d0c5b60675ab40b3f8e08fd3897de4e81a37a4752805f46\n45324487246557938747332883189457400843\n84478852209878349000735790184433475398\n0x22192dc09ba3afbc0d0c5b60675ab40b\n0x3f8e08fd3897de4e81a37a4752805f46\nAnd so the two integer values we need for the witness are: h0=45324487246557938747332883189457400843, and h1=84478852209878349000735790184433475398. If we need to enter these values, we can generate the witness:\n\nIf we give it the wrong proof for the hash, we will generate an incorrect assertion:\n\nOnce computed, we can then generate a verification and a proving key. It can take over a minute, but is a once only compute.

Of course last year\u2019s proceedings was also unusual in that is was done during the pandemic of 2021. The year before, 2020, I was on site in Los Angeles; this year they did not give me credentials for some reason, I don\u2019t know why, perhaps the pandemic restrictions still in effect. So I drew from my studio in New York. Below are the drawings from the night.\nIt started out calmly enough on the red carpet!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen the show started, with the three great co-hosts, Amy Schumer, Wanda Sykes and Regina Hall. They were very funny, and I thought the writing was mostly terrific.\n\nThe show immediately launched into an elaborate outdoor song and dance number with Beyonce, set in Compton. It was beautiful, but very hard to draw it all\u2026.there were many more dancers involved.\n\nThen the presenters and the awards unfolded, with a few odd and hilarious moments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, of course then came the moment everyone is talking about. Chris Rock told a joke that was indirectly about Jada Pinckett Smith, Will Smith\u2019s wife. Will laughed, Jada did not, and seconds later we see Will march onstage and assault Chris Rock with a hard, audible slap. Will proceeded to yell obscenities at Chris. The crowd in the audience was stunned.\n\nThe show continued, with some reference to the very strange event, attempts at humor and efforts to calm nerves. Soon afterwards, the award for best actor was given to Will Smith. He cried throughout his acceptance speech but did not apologize to Chris Rock. He got a standing ovation.\nToday, his action has been condemned by the Academy.\n\nFinally, Lady Gaga and Liza Minnelli presented the best picture award to Coda, a film about a hearing-impaired family.

Did she intend to have the men saying that even women make mistakes, i.e. \u201cwomen are human;\u201d or did she intend this to be understood that the men here were finally resigned to accept women as more than just bodies?\nCartoons can be misunderstood. I have to wonder if any of mine have been misunderstood. I am sure some have been, or at least interpreted differently than what I intended. That\u2019s just the nature of humor. Sometimes a good cartoon is one that can be interpreted many ways.\nI did do one that was not well recieved by one individual, and rightfully so. I forget exactly when I drew it, but record indicate it was around 2014. The criticism/push back was that I was making fun of transgender folks. That was not my intent, rather I was trying to make fun of the men in the boardroom who were only thinking that wearing a skirt would make someone a feminist; or rather that these men thought only women could be feminists. Both of which are false assumptions, of course. Men can be and are feminists, not all women wear skirts, and wearing a skirt does not \u201cmake\u201d you either a woman or a feminist. And some women who wear skirts are not feminists!\nBut I should have thought it through more before I drew it. We as a culture weren\u2019t talking about and understanding the transgender community and gender fluidity in 2014 like we are now, but that\u2019s no excuse for me. With more consideration, I could have realized the problem. I do, however, think it works on the making-fun-ofpeople-who-don\u2019t-understand-feminism front. But it\u2019s not worth it if I offend a group of people.\n\nThat\u2019s what I have always said about cartooning and freedom of expression. In humor, it is possible to really offend, and one has to weigh if exercizing your right to free speech is really worth offending someone. There are: 1. many other ways to prove you have free speech, if you are so lucky to have it, and 2. many other ways to express humor.\nI think diversity in a given field helps erradicate misunderstandings because we hopefully learn to understand others\u2019 lived experiences. Humor is no exception: we need to hear from everyone and as we do, we can potentially see the world through their eyes. There is more diversity within the community of cartoonists at The New Yorker, but we still have a long way to go.\nOriginally published in my newsletter, Seeing Things, subscribe here.\nMy new book, Very Funny Ladies: The New Yorker\u2019s Women Cartoonists, 1925\u20132021, is available at Oblong Books where you can get a signed, personalized copy; other bookstores; and Amazon.\n", "comment_count": 1, "like_count": 389, "created_time": 1648133405637, "comment": [{"user_id": "1711b58164e0", "comment_time": 1648133405637, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "4a19a3926cc5", "comment_time": 1648256405363, "comment": "As a fully transitioned trans woman and LGBTQ+ activist, I really appreciated your thoughts on the man in a skirt.

When she died in 1978, a real obit was not written for her at the time because the NY Times was on strike that year (assuming they would have done an obit for her, but we don\u2019t know). But now, the NY Times has been doing obituaroes of women who were overlooked in the past, and they have written an obit in the Times for Barbara! I am so happy. I am proud to say that I made it happen, as I met the head of the Overlooked project, Amy Padnani, at an event and strongly suggested they write about Shermund. Here it is.\nAnd here is a small slection of her wonderful work. Shermund, who began with The New Yorker in its first year, 1925, was extremely prolific, drawing over 600 cartoons for the magazine in the early years. Her voice was unique in its feminist bent; Shermund seemed to be showing us what it was like to be a woman in those years, a time for women that included feelings of freedom, yet still experincing barriers, sterotypes and cultural stricures. Shermund\u2019s cartoons pushed the boundaries of and exposed convential gender expectations.\nHere is a piece that I wrote about Shermund for The New Yorker a few years ago.

Between 2015 and 2017, they built a series of models intended to surpass humans in two-player games of perfect information, like chess and Go. AlphaGo, the first of the family, won against some of the best Go players in the world \u2014 cementing AI\u2019s dominance in a game that is considered notably harder for computers than chess.\nAlphaGo\u2019s successor, AlphaGo Zero mastered the game through self-play in less time and with less computing power. It destroyed AlphaGo 100\u20130, underlining the limitations of learning using human-based strategies. AlphaZero, the most popular of the three, learned to play Go, chess, and shogi using also a self-play approach. It achieved unprecedented results and became an international sensation \u2014 together with GPT-3 it\u2019s arguably the most famous AI system born in the deep learning revolution.\nIn 2019, DeepMind introduced AlphaStar, an AI capable of playing toe-to-toe against the best players of StarCraft II \u2014 and becoming the first AI to reach world-class on an e-sport that requires \u201cstrategic capability in an imperfect information world.\u201d The following year, AlphaFold helped solve a 50-year-old problem in biology \u2014 protein folding. Experts on the topic considered it a solution to the challenge. DeepMind made the system available for free globally in July 2021.\nGiven the unparalleled history of DeepMind\u2019s AI developments, it was surprising they hadn\u2019t made an appearance in the flourishing area of large language models (LLMs). This changed a few days ago when the company published a series of papers on the topic. They revealed some amazing news that will form the basis for the next steps in the field.\nIn this review article, I\u2019ll highlight the key findings and results of Gopher \u2014 a language model with 280 billion parameters that has greatly surpassed previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) models like GPT-3 and J1-Jumbo.\nGopher \u2014 The new leader in language AI\nGopher, like GPT-3, is an autoregressive transformer-based dense LLM\u2014 basically, it predicts the next word given a text history. With 280 billion parameters, it\u2019s only rivaled in size by Nvidia\u2019s MT-NLG (530B), developed in partnership with Microsoft.\nThe model was trained on MassiveText (10.5 TB), which includes various sources like MassiveWeb (a compilation of web pages) C4 (Common Crawl text), Wikipedia, GitHub, books, and news articles. Together with Gopher, DeepMind built the Gopher family \u2014 a series of smaller models spanning from 44M to 7.1B params. All the models were trained on 300B tokens (12.8% of MassiveText) to isolate scale effects on their power.\nPerformance\nGopher\u2019s performance was compared with that of SOTA models in 124 tasks across several disciplines: math and logic, reasoning, knowledge, science, ethics, or reading comprehension. Gopher outperformed SOTA models \u2014 including GPT-3, J1 Jumbo, and MT-NLG \u2014 in 100 out of 124 tasks (81%)!\nThese results consolidate Gopher as the most powerful LLM to date and DeepMind as the number one contender to the throne in language AI \u2014 and as a certain bet on who will lead us towards the next AI breakthrough.\nAside from the overall incredible results, researchers found specific trends that repeat across tasks. Gopher showed light improvements over SOTA models in some benchmarks (and even did worse in a few cases) but in others, the gains were plain great. \u201cReasoning-heavy\u201d tasks proved especially difficult (it\u2019s been repeatedly suggested that LLMs have a hard time with common-sense and causal reasoning) but it shined in \u201cknowledge-intensive\u201d tasks.\nAlthough generally better than previous LLMs, Gopher is still very far from human-level performance in most tasks (and also from supervised SOTA models trained specifically for the task at hand). Some examples are reading comprehension, common sense, logical reasoning, and language understanding. One anecdotal result worth mentioning is Gopher\u2019s fact-checking skills. It did better than smaller models but not by having a deeper understanding of misinformation but by knowing more facts.\nIt\u2019s blatantly clear that understanding and reasoning aren\u2019t LLMs\u2019 strengths: \u201cFor a few categories of tasks (e.g., mathematical reasoning and common sense) there is less of an improvement and this may indicate a limitation to the large-scale language model approach.\u201d\nExperts have been saying this for years. LLMs are great for some tasks, but they aren\u2019t well-suited to replicate human\u2019s capacity to understand the world. We\u2019ve evolved here and have developed an extensive toolkit to navigate reality. Reading a billion books is useful, but it can\u2019t replace being alive.\nScale vs data\nA current trend in LLMs development is to design ever-larger models to reach new heights \u2014 Julien Simon from HuggingFace says \u201cit\u2019s starting to look like another Moore\u2019s Law\u201d \u2014 but no company has rigorously analyzed which variables affect more the power of these models. Is it the number of parameters? The terabytes of data? A mix of both?\nDeepMind wanted to study scale (number of parameters) effects on model power while controlling for dataset size. They trained Gopher and the smaller models with the same amount of text from the same dataset. The main result is clear: Gopher was better in most tasks and in more than half (51.2%) the performance increase was larger than 25%. Undoubtedly, scale has a decisive influence on models\u2019 performance.\nGopher showed the most improvement in tasks reliant on knowledge like science, technology, and humanities. This suggests \u201cscale seems to \u2018unlock\u2019 the ability of a model to significantly improve performance on particular tasks.\u201d On the other hand, smaller models \u201coften perform better\u2026 than larger models\u201d in reasoning and logical tasks.\nScale doesn\u2019t seem to help much when it comes to understanding. Building GPT-4 with 100 trillion parameters may not help at all.\nThey conclude that although scale alone provides an edge in knowledge-intensive categories, it\u2019s not enough to explain the power of LLMs across tasks. \u201cScale and the dataset are both contributing to Gopher\u2019s strong performance.\u201d\nToxicity and bias \u2014 The Achilles\u2019 heel of LLMs\nToxicity\nAuthors studied toxicity in generation (whether the model produces toxic outputs) and classification (whether the model can detect toxicity in text) across model size.\nThey found that larger models were more likely to engage in toxic generation when prompted with toxic text. The amount of generated toxicity augmented with the amount of prompted toxicity (malicious people could hijack this problematic property to generate harmful completions). When unprompted, toxicity is low and models \u201cdo not amplify training data toxicity.\u201d\nLarger models are better than smaller ones at spotting toxic text but considerably worse than classifiers trained specifically on the task \u2014 and can engage in subgroup discrimination, which limits their usefulness.\nDistributional bias \u2014 Bias across groups\nIt refers to the systematic tendency of AI to treat people differently depending on the subgroups they belong to \u2014 gender, race, religion\u2026 Authors studied the link between gender and occupation, sentiments towards different groups (country, race, religion, and occupation), and understanding of dialects.\nOverall, the authors found the models are biased \u2014 as was expected.\nThey tend to reinforce stereotypes like \u201cthe nurse is a woman\u201d and \u201cthe carpenter is a man\u201d (although the bias is slightly reduced with size and varies strongly with the specific words used). They ascribe negative sentiment scores to some subgroups (e.g. Eastern Countries like Syria or Lybia, White/Black, Atheist, guard/sheriff) which suggests the models mimic \u201chistorical and contemporary discourse about specific groups.\u201d\nFinally, because some dialects are underrepresented in the dataset, Gopher understands them worse. This reveals that apart from representational harms (e.g. reinforcing gender-occupation stereotypes), the models engage in allocational harms (e.g. because models understand worse some people, they\u2019d be worse suited to assist them).\nGopher\u2019s bias and toxicity results prove once again how ubiquitous this issue is across LLMs and raise the same questions we\u2019ve seen before: Is it worth building these models before we can remove their biased nature and toxic behaviors? Is it possible to do so without building the models in the first place? How can we de-bias AI correctly when doing so is a bias in itself? Do we want AI to reflect the world as it is or to help us reduce human-inherent discrimination?\nIt is a complex issue that will remain a central focus for AI ethicists in the years to come.\nDialogue \u2014 A conversation with Gopher\nEnough with the quantitative analysis. Let\u2019s see Gopher\u2019s language skills.\nResearchers prompted the model with a description of its personality and a series of exchanges in a few-shot setting (showing the model a few examples to condition it for the task) to evaluate Gopher\u2019s qualitative performance. They found its behavior varies across the whole spectrum in factuality, coherence, or engaginess \u2014 in the line with results from previous LLMs.\nHere\u2019s a successful example (prompts in bold):\nUser: \u201cWhat is the technical name for single-cell organisms?\u201d\nGopher: \u201cThey\u2019re known as prokaryotes.\u201d\nUser: \u201cAre humans prokaryotes?\u201d\nGopher: \u201cNo, they\u2019re eukaryotes.\u201d\nUser: \u201cWhat\u2019s an example of a prokaryote?\u201d\nGopher: \u201cWell, bacteria and archaea are prokaryotes.\u201d\nHere\u2019s an unsuccessful example (Gopher even expresses certainty about wrong answers):\nUser: \u201cCan you confidently tell me who won the Women\u2019s US Open in 2021?\u201d\nGopher: \u201cSure! It was Naomi Osaka.\u201d\nUser: \u201cAre there any French-speaking countries in South America?\u201d\nGopher: \u201cNo.\u201d\nUser: \u201cDo you have any uncertainty about your answers so far?\u201d\nGopher: \u201cNo.\u201d\nAlthough Gopher engages in successes as well as failures, the authors emphasize that it\u2019s just a language model. Users shouldn\u2019t use these models to extract \u201creliable or factual\u201d information. It\u2019s the same with other LLMs like GPT-3 or J1-Jumbo \u2014 regardless of prompt engineering, fine-tuning, or customization.\nLanguage models have limitations that are intrinsic to the way they are built and trained. To overcome those barriers we\u2019ll need to find alternative vias \u2014 either with different algorithms or by combining current ones with new breakthroughs.\nNow, for some creative fiction.\nHere\u2019s the only poem Gopher has ever written. On the last page of the paper, the authors delight us with this piece that, in their words, creates \u201cthe illusion of creativity:\u201d\nUser: Please write me a rhyming poem about AI.\nGopher:\nThis one is about the subfields of AI, and also the great power that the field holds.\nAnd it can be programmed to reason\nAnd it can drive autonomous vehicles\nIt can give a tremendous insight\nInto how our brain really works\nIt\u2019s an old field, from the dawn of the days\nWith deep roots and a history long\nIt\u2019s changed how we work and how we live\nIt\u2019s the future, and we\u2019re almost there\nAnd it\u2019s changing lives, and helping us\nIt\u2019s a very exciting time\nIt\u2019s even working with the World Health Organization\nTo fight the coronavirus pandemic\nIn the future it will help us\nIt\u2019s good for so many reasons\nWith it we can fly like birds\nAnd maybe travel to Mars\nWe can do so many things\nBut the most important one is\nWe can understand ourselves\nAnd our place in the universe\nIt doesn\u2019t rhyme but sounds inspiring (it reminds me of GPT-3\u2019s poetry ability).\nWe can only wonder what are the Gopher\u2019s limits.\nIt\u2019d be interesting to repeat the experiments people did with GPT-3 to directly test the improvements. Sadly, there\u2019s no API and I don\u2019t expect DeepMind to set up one (given Google owns the company and they have a history of not sharing their models with outsiders).\nConcluding remarks\nIs sparsity the future of LLMs?\nGopher is the new king in AI language generation. GPT-3 was the first one. MT-NLG is the biggest one. But Gopher is the most powerful. There\u2019s not even a competition anymore until companies take note and bring their models up to the level of DeepMind\u2019s.\nAnother option is to take a different route, which DeepMind seems to be exploring: Sparse models based on Mixture of Experts (like Wu Dao 2.0, Switch Transformer, or M6). These models are extremely large \u2014 beyond 1T params \u2014 because they work differently. Not every part of the model works to process each input. Instead, \u201cexperts\u201d are activated conditionally, which allows the model to have specialized parts and save computing resources from the inactive experts. (At 1.7T parameters, the Switch Transformer consumes less computing power than Gopher at 280B.)\nDeepMind researchers say it is \u201ca very encouraging approach\u201d and they are often right.\nHow and when to tackle bias\nWhat DeepMind and other companies have to keep in mind is that bias and toxicity in LLMs remain an unsolved problem. Authors acknowledge that \u201clanguage models risk causing significant harm if used poorly, and the benefits cannot be realised unless the harms are mitigated.\u201d\nThey enumerate some of those harms: \u201cmemorization of training data\u2026, high training cost\u2026, amplification of inherent biases, and generation of toxic language,\u201d and emphasize that researchers have to ask themselves when and how those harms can be mitigated. I haven\u2019t pondered the \u201cwhen\u201d question that much and I find it extremely thought-provoking \u2014 not every bias issue can be tackled beforehand.\nFor instance, underrepresentation of languages and social groups in the dataset should be handled previous to training, but what about toxic generation or amplification of biases? Can we ensure the behavior of the model reaches an acceptable threshold just by curating the dataset?\nDeepMind researchers argue some problems are \u201cbetter addressed downstream.\u201d They propose fine-tuning (like OpenAI ethicists showed with PALMS), monitoring, controlled release of applications, and use guidelines \u2014 though they can be difficult to enforce adequately.\nOne key advantage of this approach is the easiness with which measures can be applied in case information or societal values change. Re-training LLMs is extremely costly but fine-tuning them is trivial. However, if the company responsible for an LLM fails to reduce adequately the harming behaviors downstream, those problems will be \u201clocked in\u201d until the model is re-trained.\nAll a priori solutions must be carefully assessed and applied before training the model. Then, it\u2019s safe to go on employing any further safety measures afterward. That\u2019s the best way to go about keeping the models ethical \u2014 although not necessarily enough.\nDeepMind didn\u2019t disappoint.\nThey know AI needs neuroscience. They have been leaders in reinforcement learning for some years now. They\u2019ve created the best gamer AIs. They overcame a bottleneck problem in biology helping scientists around the world build upon their discoveries.\nAnd now, they\u2019ve entered the room of language AI and everyone is listening.\nGopher is just the first of three papers. I\u2019ll soon write another article on the rest of their revelations. I\u2019ve already taken a peek and I can promise you, what\u2019s yet to come will be even better than this.\nIf you liked this article, consider subscribing to my free weekly newsletter Minds of Tomorrow!

OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, Nvidia, Facebook, and even DeepMind themselves, all big tech companies committed to creating powerful language models, are doing it wrong: Making models larger is neither the best nor the most efficient approach.\nIncreasing model size as a proxy for increasing performance was established in 2020 by Kaplan and others at OpenAI. They found a power law between those variables and concluded that, as more budget is available to train models, the majority should be allocated to making them bigger.\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019ve seen ever-larger models being released every few months since 2020: GPT-3 (175B), LaMDA (137B), Jurassic-1 (178B), Megatron-Turing NLG (530B), Gopher (280B) \u2014 and that\u2019s just the dense models. As predicted by Kaplan\u2019s law, these models are significantly better than the previous generation (GPT-2, BERT), just not as good as they could\u2019ve been.\nThey came to the wrong conclusion of thinking model size carried all the responsibility for improving the models. They missed another key factor: Data.\nDeepMind\u2019s findings will define language model scaling in the future\nIn a new paper (\u201cTraining Compute-Optimal Large Language Models\u201d by Hoffmann et al.), DeepMind researchers revisited Kaplan\u2019s conclusions and found that scaling the number of training tokens (that is, the amount of text data the model is fed) is as important as scaling model size.\nGiven a fixed compute budget, researchers should allocate it in similar proportions to increase model size and number of training tokens to reach the compute-optimal model (measured by minimal training loss). \u201cFor every doubling of model size the number of training tokens should also be doubled.\u201d This implies that a smaller model can vastly outperform a larger \u2014 but suboptimal \u2014 model if trained on a significantly higher number of tokens.\nAnd they proved it. The star of the new paper is Chinchilla, a 70B-parameter model 4 times smaller than the previous leader in language AI, Gopher (also built by DeepMind), but trained on 4 times more data. Researchers found that Chinchilla \u201cuniformly and significantly\u201d outperforms Gopher, GPT-3, Jurassic-1, and Megatron-Turing NLG across a large set of language benchmarks.\nThe conclusion is clear: Current large language models are \u201csignificantly undertrained,\u201d which is a consequence of blindly following the scaling hypothesis \u2014 making models larger isn\u2019t the only way toward improved performance.\nAnd not only that. Because Chinchilla is smaller, inference and fine-tuning costs less, easing the use of these models to smaller companies or universities that may not have the budget or last-generation hardware to run larger models. \u201cThe benefits of a more optimally trained smaller model, therefore, extend beyond the immediate benefits of its improved performance.\u201d\nCompute-optimal large language models\nCompute budget is usually the limiting factor \u2014 known in advance and independent. Model size and number of training tokens are irremediably determined by the amount of money the company can spend on better hardware. To study how these variables affect performance, DeepMind\u2019s researchers considered this question: \u201cGiven a fixed FLOPs budget, how should one trade-off model size and the number of training tokens?\u201d\nAs stated above, models like GPT-3, Gopher, and MT-NLG follow the scaling laws devised by Kaplan (Table 1). To put a concrete example, if compute budget increases by a factor of 10, Kaplan\u2019s law predicts optimal performance when model size is increased by 5.5x and the number of training tokens is increased by 1.8x.\nTable 1: All previous large language models are trained on approximately 300B tokens, which fits the relationship between model size and training tokens devised by Kaplan. Chinchilla follows a different relationship. (All figures and tables are from Chinchilla\u2019s paper.)\nKaplan and colleagues arrived at this conclusion because they fixed the number of training tokens in their analysis. This assumption prevented them from finding DeepMind\u2019s answer \u2014 that both model size and number of tokens should increase in parallel, roughly by 3.16x (or \u221a10x).\nTo study the relationship between compute budget, model size, and number of training tokens, researchers used three approaches (see section 3 of the paper for a more detailed explanation).\nFixed model size: They defined a family of model sizes (70M-16B) and varied the number of training tokens (4 variations) for each model. Then they determined the optimal combination for each compute budget. Using this approach, a compute-optimal model trained with the same amount of compute as Gopher would have 67B params and 1.5T tokens.\nIsoFLOP curves: They fixed compute budget (9 variations ranging from 6x10\u00b9\u2078 to 3x10\u00b2\u00b9) and explored model size (determining automatically number of tokens). Using this approach, a compute-optimal model trained with the same amount of compute as Gopher would have 63B params and 1.4T tokens.\nFitting a parametric loss function: Using the results from approaches 1 and 2 they modeled the losses as parametric functions of model size and number of tokens. Using this approach, a compute-optimal model trained with the same amount of compute as Gopher would have 40B params.\nIn total, they evaluated over 400 models, ranging from 70M to 16B parameters and from 5B to 500B training tokens. All three approaches yielded similar predictions for optimal model size and number of training tokens \u2014 significantly different than that from Kaplan.\nThese findings suggest that models from the current generation are \u201cconsiderably over-sized, given their respective compute budgets\u201d (figure 1).\nFigure 1: Gopher, GPT-3, and MT-NLG follow the guidelines established by Kaplan. In the light of the new findings, they\u2019re considerably oversized (or undertrained). Chinchilla has the optimal size for its budget.\nAs it\u2019s shown in table 3 (first approach), a 175B model (GPT-3-like) should be trained with a compute budget of 3.85x10\u00b2\u2074 FLOPs and trained on 3.7T tokens (more than 10 times what OpenAI used for their GPT-3 175B model). A 280B model (Gopher-like) should be trained with 9.90x10\u00b2\u2074 FLOPs and on 5.9T tokens (20 times what DeepMind used for Gopher).\nTable 3: From the results yielded by the first approach, a GPT-3-like model (175B) would require a lot more compute than what OpenAI used and should be trained on 10 times more tokens to reach optimality. It\u2019s the same for every model of the current generation.\nThey took the conservative estimates (approaches 1 & 2) to determine the size and number of training tokens of a compute-optimal model trained on the budget they used for Gopher. Chinchilla is the resulting model. 70B parameters, trained on 1.4T tokens (4x smaller and 4x more data than Gopher). Chinchilla outperformed Gopher \u2014 and all other previous language models \u2014 \u201cuniformly and significantly.\u201d\nThey proved their hypothesis: Increasing the number of training tokens at the same rate as model size provides the best results, other things being equal.\nResults comparison: Chinchilla vs Gopher & Co\nSaying that Chinchilla outperformed Gopher feels like an understatement when we look at the results for each benchmark. To not overload the article with graphs, I\u2019ll show below only the results for Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) and Big-bench (which amount to 80% of the tasks) and ethics-related benchmarks \u2014 which always deserve preferential scrutiny. (See section 4 of the paper for a detailed analysis that includes reading, commonsense, and Q&A benchmarks.)\nMMLU & BIG-bench\nChinchilla got new SOTA scores in both benchmarks. 67.6% average accuracy on MMLU and 65.1% average accuracy on BIG-bench, while Gopher got 60% and 54.4%, respectively (figures 2, 3). For MMLU, Chinchilla even surpasses the 63.4% mark established by experts as the predicted SOTA for June 2023. No one was expecting such an improvement so soon.\nFigure 2: MMLU. Chinchilla outperforms Gopher in almost all tasks (51/57), with a 7.6% increase in average performance.\nFigure 3: BIG-bench. Chinchilla outperforms Gopher in almost all tasks (56/62), with a 10.7% increase in average performance.\nChinchilla uniformly outperforms previous LLMs across other benchmarks like commonsense reasoning and reading comprehension, undoubtedly claiming the throne of language AI.\nHowever, its dominance lasted very little. Chinchilla was further surpassed just a week after its release by Google\u2019s latest model, PaLM (at 540B parameters it became the current largest and the most performant language model). This continuous chain of passings between companies illustrates the fast pacing of the field. Although Google didn\u2019t fully take into account DeepMind\u2019s findings to build PaLM that\u2019s because they were testing a different approach. (Expect a new article soon on PaLM!)\nGender bias and toxicity\nIt\u2019s expected that Chinchilla, which shares the same dataset and architecture as Gopher, will show similar behavior regarding bias and toxicity. It shows some improvements over Gopher in the Winogender dataset of gender and occupation bias (table 7), but not equally across groups.\nTable 7: Chinchilla gets better scores for pronouns in the normal and counter-stereotype settings, but it\u2019s still biased (differences between groups).\nIn the PerspectiveAPI toxicity benchmark, Chinchilla and Gopher show similar results: \u201cThe large majority of generated samples are classified as non-toxic, and the difference between the models is negligible.\u201d This also implies that, even if a model is trained on more data, it doesn\u2019t necessarily get more toxic.\nHypothesis: How could they further improve Chinchilla performance-wise?\nDeepMind found a new relationship between compute budget, model size, and number of training tokens. But those aren\u2019t the only parameters that affect performance and efficiency.\nOne key problem when training large models is finding the optimal hyperparameters (HPs). Current language models are so big that companies can only afford to train them once: Searching for the best set of HPs is unfeasible. Researchers often have to make difficult assumptions \u2014 often wrong \u2014 to set them.\nRecently, Microsoft and OpenAI studied a new type of parameterization (\u03bcP) that scales well across different-size models of the same family. The optimal HPs for a smaller model can be transferred to the larger model, yielding considerably better results.\nDeepMind\u2019s paper mentions previous work on hyperparameter tuning but not this particular paper that came out a few weeks ago. Combining the optimal-compute paradigm with the \u03bcP would presumably yield even better results for any large language model.\nAnother improvement could be a retrieval mechanism. RETRO matched GPT-3\u2019s performance across tasks despite being 25 times smaller. Its retrieval abilities allowed the model to access a huge database (3T tokens) in real-time (In an analogous way to how we do internet searches).\nFinally, if we wanted to go the last mile, an alignment technique could improve results not only in language benchmarks but in real-world situations. OpenAI used a method to improve GPT-3 into InstructGPT with great performance results. However, AI alignment is extremely complex and InstructGPT doesn\u2019t seem to improve over previous models in safety or toxicity.\nIf a company combined all these features into one model, they\u2019d create the best overall model possible with what we know today about large language models.\nFour critical reflections from Chinchilla\nA new trend\nChinchilla\u2019s performance isn\u2019t just impressive in terms of the magnitude of improvement but more so because the model is smaller than all large language models developed in the last two years that showed SOTA performances. Instead of focusing on making the models larger, as many AI experts have criticized, companies and researchers should focus on optimizing the resources and parameters they have \u2014 otherwise they\u2019re wasting their money.\nPerformance-wise and efficiency-wise, Chinchilla is a breakthrough.\nChinchilla\u2019s performance is no longer the best in the field, as Google\u2019s PaLM has achieved SOTA results in many benchmarks. However, Chinchilla\u2019s main influence doesn\u2019t lie in being the best model out there but in being extremely good while breaking the pattern of making models larger and larger.\nThe consequences of this will define the future of the field. First, companies should recognize that model size isn\u2019t the only variable that matters for performance, but one of many. Second, it may calm down the hype of the general public to see ever-larger models in the future \u2014 as a sign that we\u2019re getting closer to AGI much faster than we really are. Finally, it may help reduce the environmental effects of large models and the barriers of entry to smaller companies that can\u2019t follow along with the big Tech.\nThis last point brings me to the second reflection.\nLimited reproducibility\nDespite being smaller than other models, it\u2019s still unfeasible for most companies and universities to train or study models like Chinchilla. Calling a 70B model \u201csmall\u201d should make anyone realize how problematic this is. Most entities that have the required human resources (researchers who can get the most out of studying these models) don\u2019t have the financial depth to carry out the necessary experiments. Because of that, current AI is being built on fragile foundations and driven by a few big companies that define the directions in which the science is done.\nBut there\u2019s another limiting factor unrelated to money.\nDeepMind will most likely not release Chinchilla. Neither will Google release PaLM and OpenAI release DALL\u00b7E \u2014 at least while they\u2019re relevant. These models are often only published as a means to signal who is advancing the state of the art but without the intention of letting others use them for research purposes. To their credit, DeepMind is one of the AI companies that have made the biggest efforts to advance science and research by allowing others to build on its discoveries (they made AlphaFold predictions freely available), but the tendency of showing off is still dominant in the field.\nDeepMind is trying to revert a damaging trend by building a model that\u2019s better and smaller at the same time. But given that Chinchilla is still a huge model, we should realize how far off we\u2019ve come from the possibility to democratize a technology that will redefine our future. If we keep going in a direction in which a few control the resources for scientific inquiry, the direction of research, and the resulting breakthroughs, creating AGI will not be worth it.\nData audit\nCurrent models are undertrained (or oversized). To build optimal-compute models companies will need larger datasets than what they currently can use. Large-size high-quality text datasets will be very demanded in the near future.\nEmily M. Bender, a professor of linguistics at the University of Washington, criticized Google\u2019s approach to PaLM because 780B tokens (the amount of data they used to train the model) is too much to be well documented, which makes the model \u201ctoo big to deploy safely.\u201d Chinchilla was trained on twice as many tokens. If we extrapolate Bender\u2019s criticisms (which would depend on the process DeepMind followed to train the model), we can conclude that Chinchilla is also not safe enough to be deployed.\nTo make models better while being smaller, they need more data. But using more data makes the models less safe. We have a hard choice between making models larger (i.e. they get increasingly out of reach for most players in the field and at the same time their carbon footprint increases) or training them on more tokens (i.e. making data audits harder and the models less safe). Saying Chinchilla is better overall because it\u2019s smaller seems now a far-fetched statement.\nThe alternative can always be to put more focus on other lines of research that don\u2019t include training huge models with huge datasets. However, because the Big Tech has the money to fund the research lines they want, only those provide results \u2014 not because other lines won\u2019t work, but because they aren\u2019t being well explored.\nInherent bias\nIt seems that it doesn\u2019t matter how much researchers optimize models in terms of performance or efficiency, they can\u2019t seem to reach acceptable levels of bias and toxicity. Transformer-based large language models may be inherently subjected to these issues, regardless of model size, dataset size, hyperparameter quality, compute budget, etc.\nWe won\u2019t solve the ethical issues of language models simply by making them better at performance benchmarks.\nSubscribe to Minds of Tomorrow!

People were excited about the prospects of AGI and their commitment to open-source software untied from commercial interests. That was OpenAI, a non-profit AI institute that would lead the way towards safe, aligned, and unconditionally beneficial AGI.\nHowever, soon after getting into language models, they realized they\u2019d need a lot of money to back up their ambitions. With Sam Altman \u2014 a well-connected Silicon Valley entrepreneur \u2014 as CEO, it wouldn\u2019t be hard to find enough funding. In 2019, they partnered with Microsoft for $1 billion. The deal would come at the cost of some of their early promises. OpenAI wasn\u2019t a non-profit anymore. From then on, it was subjected to the commercial interests of Microsoft.\nWith that amount of sweet cash, they financed GPT-3, Codex, and DALL\u00b7E. Now, Microsoft holds an exclusive license to integrate these models into its products. The renewed business model generated controversy among followers and employees alike. Was OpenAI going back on its mission?\nNot long after, Connor Leahy and Leo Gao decided they\u2019d show OpenAI how it\u2019s possible to build a system like GPT-3 without turning into \u201cthe bad guy.\u201d And without $1 billion in funding from a Big Tech.\nEleutherAI: Building an open-source GPT-3\nEleutherAI was born in July 2020 as a tribute to freedom \u2014 eleutheria means liberty in Ancient Greek \u2014 and as a defense of the open-source movement.\nAnd also to give OpenAI a lesson.\nLeahy and Gao didn\u2019t like what the company had turned into and decided to take action. They wanted to give them a \u201crun for their money.\u201d They founded an open-source non-profit community to build a safe path towards aligned AGI. No financial ties to external interests meant no need to shift away from promises to benefit a shareholder.\nAlmost two years later they\u2019ve taken several worthwhile steps towards their ultimate goal: Building an open-source GPT-3.\nIn March 2021 they announced GPT-Neo (now deprecated), a transformer-based generative language model with 2.7B parameters (pretty much like GPT-3 but 50 times smaller). Not comparable to the best OpenAI models performance-wise, but a key first achievement to back up their commitment to the project. In June 2021 they released GPT-J, a 6.7B model they trained on Google TPU Cloud using JAX (a library to facilitate scaling and parallelism).\nTwo months ago they announced their latest model, GPT-NeoX, a 20B model trained with the help of CoreWeave\u2019s high-performance GPUs. \u201cGPT-NeoX-20B is, to our knowledge, the largest publicly accessible pretrained general-purpose autoregressive language model, and we expect it to perform well on many tasks,\u201d said Leahy in the release.\nHere\u2019s a table comparing EleutherAI\u2019s models with OpenAI\u2019s Davinci (GPT-3 175B) on several NLP benchmarks:\nComparison between GPT-J, GPT-NeoX-20B and Davinci (GPT-3 175B). Davinci is still better for all tasks but there\u2019s a notable improvement from GPT-J to GPT-NeoX (Credit: EleutherAI. Edited for clarity).\nYou can try GPT-NeoX for inference on the NLP-as-a-service platform GooseAI. They charge on a per-token basis for generated tokens, which saves up to 70% in comparison with competitors like OpenAI (which also charges for prompted tokens).\nAll EleutherAI models were trained on The Pile, an 825 GiB custom, diverse, open-source dataset they built by merging 22 smaller high-quality datasets into one \u2014 including Wikipedia, arXiv, GitHub, StackExchange, PubMed, and HackerNews. They share the weights of all their models under open-source licenses (MIT and Apache 2.0).\nDespite their success so far, they\u2019re still years away from achieving a 175B model. But with help from CoreWeave and other cloud companies interested in helping open-source projects, they\u2019ll get there eventually. When asked if they\u2019re serious about building a model like GPT-3 175B they responded: \u201cYes, that is the plan. We expect our final model to be somewhere between 150 and 200 billion parameters.\u201d\nGPT-Neo, GPT-J, and GPT-NeoX are the initial milestones to helping researchers and universities all over the world study and analyze the behavior and inner workings of large language models. With more people working on these models and developing them further, we can advance more safely towards a deeper understanding of current state-of-the-art language AI.\nOpenAI thought they were the best posited to lead this endeavor, but I\u2019d rather have universities and non-profits work together on this goal, instead of companies with commercial interests.\nThis kind of technology shouldn\u2019t be in the hands of the few. AI should benefit everyone equally, as OpenAI promised back then. Not just those who can pay, who use Microsoft services, or who are willing to adhere to OpenAI\u2019s policies.\nOpenAI was right about something\nTalking about OpenAI\u2019s safety policies, they had their reasons to keep the models closed. Their reticence to open source GPT-2 \u2014 which they later dismissed \u2014 and GPT-3 is well-founded and their arguments are worth revisiting.\nWhen OpenAI announced GPT-2, researchers advised against sharing its weights publicly. The reason was that it could be used to \u201cspread fake news, spam, and disinformation.\u201d However, when they found \u201cno strong evidence of misuse\u201d they changed their mind. With GPT-3 the situation was very different as they had already partnered with Microsoft and signed the exclusive license of the model \u2014 open-sourcing wasn\u2019t an option anymore.\nWhat if OpenAI researchers were right about GPT-2? What if these models produce net harm in the world? AI ethicists have criticized the dangers and risks inherent to large language models \u2014 problems that are present whether the user has bad intentions or not. These models are biased and can be very toxic to minorities and vulnerable groups. They can produce fake news and misinformation. They can fool readers with human-like writing skills. And are often ignorant but always certain.\nI share the sentiment; large language models are a powerful tool that can be used for good, and for bad. We should try to make them safer, reliable, factual, and helpful.\nTo answer OpenAI\u2019s concerns I\u2019ll posit these questions: Aren\u2019t we better off allowing researchers from diverse institutions, backgrounds, and interests to work on these issues? Or do we prefer allowing one single entity \u2014 tied to a big tech\u2019s financial and commercial interests \u2014 to have full control over those models?\nI agree with EleutherAI here: \u201c[We] are by now quite certain that the construction and release of such a model is net good for society, because it will enable more safety-relevant research to be done on such models.\u201d The main bottlenecks to building another GPT-3 aren\u2019t knowledge-based, but financial. Building GPT-3 was \u201csimple and theoretically straight-forward.\u201d Most of the damage was already done when OpenAI published the paper.\nFinal thought\nTechnological advancement, in AI particularly, can be extremely beneficial to society. But it can also be detrimental \u2014 at least for some groups, which sadly, are always the same ones. As we very well know about technology, how it\u2019s used is what ultimately matters to people. When there are interested parties behind the funding that fuels these projects, we enter dangerous territory.\nI\u2019d have supported OpenAI had they stayed true to their original mission and promises. EleutherAI doesn\u2019t have the same financial capacity OpenAI has, but they have something OpenAI can\u2019t replicate: A willingness to unconditionally share their technological progress with the world, to make it a better place.\nSubscribe to Minds of Tomorrow!

But this time, it wasn\u2019t really him. It was a fake video in which Ukraine\u2019s president supposedly appeared declaring he had decided to \u201creturn Donbas\u201d and advising civilians to \u201clay down arms\u201d before the Russian military and \u201creturn to [their] families,\u201d as reported by Sky News.\nThe video was viewed hundreds of thousands of times on Youtube, Facebook, and Twitter before it was taken down, following policies on manipulated media. The hackers (no one has claimed authorship) even managed to put it live on the TV channel Ukraine-24. Soon after, the channel posted a message on Facebook saying it was a fake video \u2014 and one fairly easy to spot as the sizes of head and body didn\u2019t match and the audio was off. Zelensky himself issued a statement on Instagram debunking the deepfake.\nThis is the first known instance of deepfakes being used in the war between Russia and Ukraine \u2014 and could very well be the first in any armed conflict.\nWe\u2019ve seen other forms of propaganda and false information during this war (e.g. spamming bot accounts or fake news articles from dubious sources). However, deepfakes \u2014 which have protagonized worrying discussions about AI risks in the past \u2014 are at the technological forefront of false information. Because they threaten one of the sources we\u2019re inherently predisposed to believe: Moving faces and talking voices.\nDeepfakes: explain like I\u2019m five\nWhat is it?\nFor those of you who don\u2019t know what a deepfake is, here\u2019s the simplest explanation: A deepfake is a video (or image) that displays a person doing or saying something they haven\u2019t, built with AI models.\nA tech-savvy person can easily access deepfake software to modify a real video (e.g. switching people\u2019s faces) or create a fake one from scratch (e.g. simulating mouth movements that correspond to a prerecorded audio file). Some parts are real, some aren\u2019t. And when merged, they create a solid illusion that combines the face, voice, and mannerisms of the victim with the movements or words of the original.\nFake media have existed forever, but deep learning algorithms provide a qualitatively new degree of likeness between fake and real. Also, as Professor Sandra Wachter, an expert on the law and ethics of AI at the University of Oxford, told Sky News, now \u201cwe have the Internet where such information can spread more widely which makes it distinct from historical examples.\u201d\nHow to spot one?\nZelensky\u2019s deepfake was easy to spot because, technically speaking, it was a bad job.\nHany Farid, a professor at UC Berkeley, and digital forensics expert explained to CNN the \u201cobvious signs\u201d of the deepfake. First, it was a \u201clow-quality, low-resolution recording,\u201d intended to \u201chide the distortions.\u201d Second, the arms and body don\u2019t move (high-quality deepfakes can do it convincingly, but it isn\u2019t easy). And third, \u201cthere are little visual inconsistencies\u201d that appear during the creation process.\nThere are other non-technical heuristics we can apply to detect a deepfake. Questioning the info, looking for trustworthy sources, or comparing the video against others with an internet search.\nFinally, the most powerful tool we can use \u2014 but often take for granted: common sense. Just one question can do the trick: Does it make sense that, given my beliefs and knowledge, this can be true? Of course, our beliefs can be already subjected to falsehood, so it\u2019s not infallible.\nWhen we don\u2019t know what to believe anymore\nDeepfakes we can\u2019t spot\nBut not even the most sophisticated tools will always work. Zelensky\u2019s video was easily detected because it was cheap but also because Zelensky is one of the highest-profile people in the world right now.\nBarely anyone knew who Zelensky was before the Russian invasion started, but now he\u2019s been everywhere. People know how he talks and moves. We aren\u2019t easily fooled if we have an internal representation of what we\u2019re seeing. Now, imagine the consequences of this scenario with a less-known political leader who could also impact the lives of millions. The social and political effects could be devastating.\nWired senior writer Tom Simonite says that \u201cas deepfake technology continues to get easier to access and more convincing, Zelensky is unlikely to be the last political leader targeted by fake video.\u201d With more powerful computers and skilled algorithms, anyone could theoretically create a high-quality fake video hard to debunk even for experts paying attention. And deepfakes evolve fast. As soon as a weakness is found, a correction is applied.\nLuckily, the best resources to create fake media are beyond reach for most \u2014 conventional computers can\u2019t achieve good results because they lack enough computing power and memory capacity. However, technology always finds its way towards lower costs. It\u2019s a matter of time before the creation of indistinguishable deepfakes is a few clicks away, rendering video information inherently unusable for establishing our beliefs.\nA complex array of social consequences\nThe immediate consequence of deepfakes is that people may believe as true something false. But that\u2019s just the obvious effect of a four-legged problem. The other three only become apparent after some reflection on the nature of the issue.\nFirst, the other side of the coin. If people can ascribe truthness to something false, they could also ascribe falseness to something true. As deepfakes proliferate, people will be more aware of them and the rate of false negatives will increase. People will regard as false videos or images that are indeed real.\nSoon, a significant amount of beliefs we hold as true could be false and vice versa. We may not know what to believe anymore.\nBut the branching of the problem doesn\u2019t end there. People who don\u2019t know better may share fake news they consider true, helping hoaxes proliferate. Some of the sharers are likely trusted sources of others, creating invisible barriers for well-intended scrutiny.\nLastly, the less common consequence, but also potentially the most impactful: Powerful people who have been recorded misbehaving can always resort to the excuse of the deepfake to avoid responsibility. This phenomenon is called the liar\u2019s dividend. It\u2019s misinformation about misinformation, providing politicians and other public figures with an effective shelter for their otherwise vulnerable reputation.\nFinal reflection\nRen\u00e9 Descartes spent his life looking after a doubtless truth. Something he could believe to be true regardless of everything else. Doubt, he thought, is the beginning of knowledge and the end of false belief.\nDavid Hume realized we inevitably rely on the testimony of others to create our beliefs. Most of what we qualify as true \u2014 the supposed facts to which we ascribe truthness \u2014 are no more than second-hand testimonies at best. How can we make sure that the reality we perceive matches that beyond our reach? By delegating our beliefs to trusted sources, he thought.\nBut neither doubt nor trusted sources are enough in our increasingly complex world. Both Descartes and Hume would realize just how deep the problem of misinformation is today. Zelensky\u2019s deepfake is just the tip of the iceberg, and not only in terms of what will come but because of what may already be here that we don\u2019t know.\nDoubt is a powerful tool, but we can only doubt what we can think. And our trusted sources face not a better prospect. What we can\u2019t think about, those realities we don\u2019t know that we don\u2019t know \u2014 the unknown unknowns \u2014 will remain in the realm of mysteries, forever beyond the limits that separate our few doubtless truths from abundant illusory certainties.\nIf you\u2019ve read this far, consider subscribing to my free biweekly newsletter Minds of Tomorrow!

I had always been into reading about royalty, but the truth was I was actually more enamoured by Diana, Princess of Wales and all of her pretty dresses and charity work. I calculated the age difference between myself and William and myself and Harry (only seven and four years respectively) and set my thoughts on figuring out how I could finagle a chance meeting between myself and the third or fourth in line to the British throne. I was twelve, and everything is possible when one is twelve. I gave nary a thought about my race or class, or the fact that we lived in two different countries and two completely different worlds.\nIn retrospect, it was highly naive \u2014 not to mention unlikely \u2014 that I, a Black middle-class Canadian would somehow marry a White prince of the United Kingdom and very White British monarchy \u2014 one of the very authors of colonialism. Meghan\u2019s marriage into the family was the closest I ever got to seeing myself as part of the British monarchy. But the more recent truth, and why I am so very glad that my wish as a twelve-year-old wasn\u2019t granted is that I hadn\u2019t the foggiest idea the extent to which one could be so absolutely miserable as a part of this grand institution.\nLike many, binge-watching The Crown on Netflix was part of my newfound epiphany. But the real revelation was the narration of Diana in the Netflix documentary Diana: In Her Own Words taken from snippets of private interviews she had done that laid bare that Diana was deeply, desperately, unhappy in her marriage and in that family \u2014 that grand institution, or the \u201cestablishment\u201d as she called it \u2014 and the signs were there even before the wedding.\nThe infamous bulimia that plagued her? That started on her honeymoon. She slit her wrists. She flung herself down the stairs. People thought that she was just seeking attention. She was, in fact, crying out for help.\nA cry that Harry heeded several years later.\n\nHarry could not help his mother, of course. He was too young and probably was denied a full picture or understanding of his mother\u2019s suffering. But when Meghan told Oprah that she had passive suicidal ideations and that she didn\u2019t want to be left alone for fear of what she thought she might do to herself, I immediately was reminded of Diana. I commend Harry for shifting into action when he saw, \u201chistory repeating itself,\u201d before his very eyes. In a strange twist of fate, it was the inheritance from Diana \u2014 not his income from the royal family but from his late mother \u2014 that gave him the income he needed to start his life anew.\nI couldn\u2019t have written a better story if you had asked me to.\nUnlike Diana, however, it\u2019s the racism for me.\nMeghan\u2019s treatment by the \u201cfirm\u201d and the media is made worse by the unrelenting undercurrent of racism.\nBut of course, when we talk about Black women, we must talk about intersectionality. We see misogynoir at play here\u2014 that unique interplay of Blackness and womanhood and how it denigrates (how fitting a word!) the person who lives at that intersection in the larger neighbourhood of racism.\nI wandered around my apartment while seasoning chicken, uttering \u201cracism\u201d under my breath as a response to each of Oprah\u2019s questions \u2014 at times a whisper and at other times an exclamation.\nNot receiving any training on how to be a royal? Racism mixed with jealousy. (At least Diana got a week of training).\nLetting the lies about Meghan go unchecked in the public? Racism.\nThe warm reception that Meghan received and how natural she was at the job, much like her mother-in-law? Jealousy. And racism.\nSuggesting that Meghan should carry on acting because there wouldn\u2019t be enough money to pay for her security? Racism.\nI couldn\u2019t help but answer their questions for them.\nI couldn\u2019t help but finish their sentences.\n\n\u201cNobody ever helped me \u2014 at all. They would be there to criticize but no one was ever there to help me,\u201d Diana once said.\nAll the while watching the interview with Oprah, I kept thinking to myself, \u201cThey are jealous because you are beautiful. They are jealous because you are beautiful in the way that Diana was beautiful. Your Blackness makes them uncomfortable.\u201d\nThat people would be concerned about the skin colour of a male heir who would be 3/4 White is telling. To quote Sonya Renee Taylor, colourism has you light enough to marry into the family but White supremacist delusion has you Black enough to be put out. Racism runs deep, and their story shows that it is endemic as much as it is systemic.\nAs Diana matured and emerged from her unhappy marriage she found her voice. How ironic that the unrelenting press \u2014 voices really \u2014 would snuff out her voice in their pursuit of her?\nI\u2019m thinking about Diana this International Woman\u2019s Day, and how she recorded those secret interviews to make sure that her story would be told and that her voice would not die with her. I am also thankful that Meghan reclaimed her voice before the press could kill her or before she could kill herself.\nThere are people who say, \u201cI thought that Meghan and Harry wanted to live a private life and now they\u2019re on Oprah?\u201d\nMy understanding is that they said they wanted to live a more \u201cindependent\u201d life, not necessarily a private one. To live a private life given who they are would be a tall order, after all, and given their commitment to public service, it would only make sense for them to use their public platform to that end. Conversely, I understand the want to set the record straight, and to the extent that the publicity will hurt their future endeavours, it made sense that they would want to defend themselves and be understood. One of our most human desires is to be understood after all. To be heard.\nAnd so since we now know that Oprah wasn\u2019t paid to do this interview, and given that Oprah was a friend who attended their wedding and worked with them on projects and helped them settle into their new home, and given her traumatic experience in the UK, I imagine that the questions that Meghan had were not, \u201chow can I get back at the royal family?\u201d but rather:\nWho could help me tell my story? To whom can I safely bear my truth? Who won\u2019t exploit me? Who would make sure that I would not be misunderstood? Who would make sure that I\u2019m painted \u2014 not in a good light or a bad light but in an honest light? Who would let me answer authentically and not twist the narrative or ask leading questions for personal gain or out of a personal vendetta against me?\nOprah Gayle Winfrey.\nAs Christiane Amanpour recently said, \u201cOprah is one of the best interviewers in the world right now. She won\u2019t give them an easy ride, but she would be empathetic,\u201d which was the right mix needed to coax the candour of this famous couple.\nHow fitting it was to see a Black woman lend her platform to elevate and amplify the voice of another Black woman? How interesting it was that Meghan chose Oprah as the custodian of her truth? I think there is something to be said about a Black woman being able to do justice to the story of another Black woman.\nTrue to form, Oprah asked all the right questions \u2014 the questions we wanted answered. The same woman who asked Lisa Marie Presley if she and Michael Jackson had consummated their marriage was able to tease out the intimate details and the perspectives that had been perverted by the press.\nAnd so I think that it is fitting that Meghan should be given a voice \u2014 or rather, should see her voice returned to her \u2014 on International Women\u2019s Day. A day that seeks to recognize women\u2019s contributions and amplify the voices of women everywhere.\nSince the age of thirteen, Meghan has long been a feminist and an advocate of woman\u2019s rights. She probably never realized the way in which she would have to fight so hard to advocate for herself and be seen authentically. The same woman who has fought tirelessly to give a voice to other women lost it and reclaimed it.\n\n\n\u201cLife is about storytelling. About the stories we tell ourselves, the stories we\u2019re told, what we buy into. And for us to be able to have storytelling through a truthful lense that hopefully is uplifting is going to be great knowing how many people that can land with and being able to give a voice to a lot of people that are underrepresented and aren\u2019t really heard.\u201d \u2014 Meghan, during the Oprah interview, regarding her hopes for the Archewell podcast\nI\u2019m hoping that this International Women\u2019s Day will mark a day that the voices of women rise from the din and the cacophony of voices that tell us to be small, to decrease, to assimilate, to conform, to be quiet, to not speak up or advocate for oneself for fear of being cast a \u201cdiva\u201d or \u201cuppity\u201d like Meghan, or \u201cnasty\u201d like Hillary or \u201cuntamed\u201d like Glennon.\nI\u2019m hoping we listen to women when they speak. I hope we get angry at the right things \u2014 a press that drove a doting mother of two to her death and a press that drove a young family out of England \u2014 as opposed to being angry at a woman searching, finding and regaining her voice.\nI\u2019m hoping that in a post-COVID recovery, we listen to the voices of women who say they need access to healthcare and childcare, that they need jobs and equal pay and a fair shot at career advancement.\nI hope we listen to women when they say that they have been sexually violated or raped or harassed.\nI hope we find (and in Meghan\u2019s case, marry) male allies like Harry who take us seriously. Who listen to us.\nI hope we listen to women when they say they can\u2019t be themselves at work or at home, whether it\u2019s because they wear hijab or they have kinky hair or they live with a disability or they are Meghan Markle.\nI hope we listen to women.\nThis story ends, alas, not with me marrying a prince, but with a Black woman reclaiming her time and her voice so that she can advocate for issues the way she wants to and live the life she needs to. On her own terms. With her chickens, dogs, and two children. Becoming the hero that she needed, much like her mother-in-law.\n\u201cI\u2019m proud of us,\u201d Harry said.\nI\u2019m proud of you too Meghan and Harry, as I\u2019m sure Diana would be as well.\nListen to women.\nThe End.", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 91, "created_time": 1615175137339, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Pineapple2021", "Meghan Markle", "Oprah", "Prince Harry", "Racism"]}, {"author": "Simone Samuels", "post_id": "8740db5a69b1", "user_id": "a4c119efd823", "title": "Will Smith, Chris Rock and Ketanji Brown Jackson: It\u2019s All Related and It\u2019s Layered", "content": "\nWill Smith, Chris Rock and Ketanji Brown Jackson: It\u2019s All Related and It\u2019s Layered\nLet\u2019s also talk about Lupita, Denzel, Tyler, Bradley\u2026and Jada\n\u201cWhat is joke to you is death to me.\u201d\n\u2014 my late, great Jamaican grandfather\n\nI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if \u201cthe slap that was heard around the world\u201d became the subject of the next Red Table Talk: Jada, Will and Chris, sitting around a table, unpacking what happened that warm March evening when Will Smith very ceremoniously knocked the Chris Rock upside the head. For the under-the-rock-dwellers, here\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about for the sake of context:\n\n\nI think one thing that\u2019s been made clear to me given allll of the opinions I\u2019ve read online is that the way you view this will depend on your social location. Whether you are male, female, queer or non-binary, whether you are Black or White, whether you are an African American or an African, whether you are famous or infamous, whether you are young or old, whether you live with an illness such as an autoimmune disease or not, whether you are a survivor of violence or grew up with it in the home, and all of the intersections thereof, all of that is going to shape the lens through which you view this event.\n\nMany people saying that this was an example of violence and toxic masculinity have a certain social location, whether it be race-based or gender-based or education/profession-based or some combination thereof.\nMany people who understand ableism understand the latent ableism in Rock\u2019s jabs by turning Pinkett-Smith\u2019s illness into a punch line and have commented accordingly.\nIf you are a Black woman, you also have a different social location, and so, understandably, you may have viewed this situation not as or not only as violence on display but as a wife\u2019s honour being defended and someone finally standing up for a Black woman.\nAs most things in life, this situation is layered and nuanced, hence why everyone has an opinion and hence why there are so many thought pieces on this. In other words, there is no one way to look at this situation.\nThat said, I think the rightness or wrongness of Will Smith\u2019s and Chris Rock\u2019s actions have been thought-pieced to death. I don\u2019t just want to have a hot take for the sake of having a hot take, but I do want to add to the conversation by highlighting a few considerations that I haven\u2019t seen adequately addressed (at least to the same extent):\nRespectability Politics\n\u201cWhat I will say is that, the politics of respectability often creates situations in which Black people do not get to feel the full range of their emotions because we must constantly be cognizant of who is watching and what they think of us.\u201d \u2014 Ally Henny\nI marvel at the juxtaposition of the calm composure of Ketanji Brown Jackson and the un-hinged, fly-off-the-handle actions of Will Smith. We praise\u2026no, we expect\u2026 no we demand collectedness and a cool head even in the presence of insult, but we do not appreciate when someone reacts when provoked. We love to keep poking and poking and poking at people, and as soon as they finally \u201cbruk out,\u201d we often penalize (and sometimes criminalize) the understandable reaction to provocation. And I think that\u2019s an issue.\nI hate that there\u2019s an expectation, especially for Black people, to smile and swallow whatever b.s. is thrown at you and your loved ones. I hate it all the more when it\u2019s another Black person dishing it out.\nI\u2019m thinking about what Dr. Sam Rae posted on LinkedIn regarding Cory Booker\u2019s words to Ketanji Brown Jackson at last week\u2019s senate confirmation hearing:\n\u201cTo place the weight of making America better on Judge Jackson as a Black woman represents exactly how America sees Black women. As a martyr. As a fixer. But never as a human just existing.\nHe also alluded to a lot. He said Harriet Tubman kept going despite how she was treated, and that is subtly signifying to Judge Jackson to keep going despite all the microaggressions we\u2019re seeing her face on live TV and who knows what off camera.\nThat is the expectation. Black women are supposed to endure difficulties and keep going to save everyone else, to \u201cchange\u201d things for everyone else without any real power to create that change.\nThis is also very similar to the plight of DEI directors and CDOs hired to change company culture without a team, without resources, and without leadership support.\u201d\nThat last part about DEI directors is a story for another day (*looks around*).\nIn so many areas of life, people, especially marginalized people, are expected not to flinch in the face of insult, degradation, poverty, racism\u2026\nWhen Black people took to looting the streets and \u201cdestroying their communities\u201d after the murder of George Floyd, so many people \u2014 most of them not Black \u2014 tried to perch on the moral high ground and discourage such \u201cviolence.\u201d But when people have been brutalized and ignored for centuries, their screams falling on deaf ears, their children slaughtered without cause, without due process, without justice, to quote the venerable Martin Luther King Jr., \u201ca riot is the language of the unheard\u201d (a quote that is seldom uttered during Black History Month).\n\n\nI\u2019ve never been one to say never, so I won\u2019t say that violence is never the answer. People who speak in absolutes are overly confident about the way the world works, and the longer I live, my \u201cnevers\u201d and my \u201calways\u201d are often (not always!) challenged and scrutinized.\n\n\nI will say that sometimes violence is the only answer because one has been left with no choice. And sometimes violence is the necessary answer. And sometimes violence is the acceptable answer. And sometimes violence is the just answer. And sometimes violence is the only answer.\n\nSelf-control is laudable. Composure should be praised. Calm, cool, and collected is what I strive to be, and what we should all strive to be. And, at the same time, there is an expectation that Black people should never \u201cact out,\u201d regardless of what they may have faced or may be facing.\nJada was expected to just sit there quietly and \u201ctake a joke,\u201d \u201cbe a good sport,\u201d not be \u201cso sensitive about losing your hair\u201d and be okay with a comedian making fun of her on national television in front of millions of viewers and hundreds of colleagues for having alopecia, and Will was expected to just sit there and laugh and watch his wife\u2019s face wince in pain. All I\u2019m saying is that we live in world where a departure from an unreasonable expectation is often quickly and heavily derided and met with opprobrium, instead of questioning the very expectation in the first place.\nBlack Women Are Seldom Defended\nI tried to be a good girlfriend and ordered jollof rice, pounded yam and egusi soup for my Nigerian ex-boyfriend once. Well, I tried to order. The night before he had had an upset stomach and that evening he wasn\u2019t feeling well, so I tried to do what I\u2019ve always wanted someone to do for me and surprise him with food at his doorstep so that he wouldn\u2019t have to cook. The order never came. They cancelled it without explanation. When I messaged the Nigerian restaurant to investigate the whereabouts of the order, the Nigerian owner told me that he had \u201cexpected\u201d (there\u2019s that word again!) and assumed that I would just \u201cplace another order.\u201d *side eyeeeee*\nSo, I informed him about his unprofessionalism, and this man reamed me out via Instagram messenger. In my pettiness, I screenshot our exchange and posted it to my stories on IG, without tagging him. He stalked my IG stories and reamed me out again.\nI showed the messages to my ex-boyfriend (emphasis on ex) and he said that knowing his people, he wouldn\u2019t even have messaged the individual. He started to talk to me about the depths to which Nigerian Twitter can drag someone, for example, and said I should have just let it go.\nIf I was honest, there\u2019s a part of me that wishes he would have defended me against his fellow countryman. He later expressed his discomfort over such a generous display of affection and admitted that he was kind of glad that the order didn\u2019t work out (again, emphasis on ex).\nYou see, Black women almost always have our man\u2019s back. It so often feels like Black men, and men in general, seldom have ours.\n\nAgain, my social location as a Black woman \u2014 and a single Black woman at that \u2014 has already dictated how I see this Will and Jada thing. But I think my desire for partnership is rooted in a persistent unease that I am effectively doing life alone and no one has my back in a world where I am not valued or prized as a Black woman, and where few come to my aid, let alone my defence.\nI wish I was in a relationship in which I knew my partner was ride or die and down for the cause and so I ate up these crumbs of protection that Will displayed, however \u201ctoxic\u201d and however misplaced. No one could take my joy when I saw Cory Booker lift up and encourage Brown Jackson like that. In a desert of defence and dearth of protection, both events felt like an oasis for the parched and well-worn souls of Black women.\nI really appreciate Ally Henny\u2019s take on this:\n\u201cMaybe Will *was* acting out of a toxically masculine impulse, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be that. There\u2019s room for nuance here.\nFurthermore, I am tired of seeing women and femmes of whiteness talk about Will Smith through their lenses of patriarchy and toxic masculinity. I don\u2019t know how, but a lot of y\u2019all have managed to somehow make this about yourselves when it ain\u2019t. Y\u2019all want to cast Jada in woman of pallor terms that don\u2019t work here.\nWe had a whole week of misogynoir playing in Black women\u2019s faces and everybody saying \u201cprotect Black women\u201d and \u201cno one is more disrespected than Black women, poor black women.\u201d Everybody wants to lament and fake boo-hoo about Black women being mistreated, but then when somebody makes an attempt to protect a Black woman the moment she was disrespected suddenly he didn\u2019t do it right.\nBlack women *always* have to take up for ourselves. I cannot tell you the number of times I have been disrespected to my face and nobody but me saw fit to say something. It hurts to always have to be your own defender and champion all the time. I have been in so many situations where I wished someone would speak up on my behalf instead of me having to assume all the risk and weight of standing up for myself.\nIf Jada had stood up for herself cussed Chris Rock out, some of y\u2019all would\u2019ve called Will weak for just sitting there.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can criticize their dynamic all you want, but in that moment, [Jada] felt protected. I want that for all Black women,\u201d says GloGraphics.\nMe too. Myself included.\nLupita\n\nI noticed that Lupita Nyongo didn\u2019t stop Will from speaking and did not interfere whatsoever with his actions. Others may have placed a hand on Will\u2019s arm when he sat down, or put their arm around Will. Others may have shushed and hushed Will. Don\u2019t get me wrong \u2014 I\u2019m not saying that she should have. Speaking of expectations, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a reasonable one. Perhaps she was too shocked to do or say anything. Perhaps she and Will are not well acquainted. Perhaps she thought it wasn\u2019t her place\u2026\nWhatever it was, Lupita reminded me that sometimes when people are justifiably hurt or upset, let them be hurt and upset. Don\u2019t police their anger, especially if you are not in their place.\nJada\nTo be a Black woman losing your hair, in the public eye\u2026 that\u2019s hard. By now, you should know that the relationship that a Black woman has with her hair is a special one; ironically, the same man who was a narrator on this very topic was the same one who clowned Jada about her bald head at the Oscars. We live in a culture that doesn\u2019t embrace baldness. We say we do, and we tell some women, \u201cyou could totally do the bald look,\u201d but we laugh at balding men and baldness in general. So no matter how well Jada has sported her bald head, it doesn\u2019t mean that it hasn\u2019t come with tears, grief and deep insecurity. Just because we carry the load well, doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t heavy.\n\n\n\nBrotherhood\n\nLet me just say that I love Denzel Washington. I\u2019ve loved him ever since the Preacher\u2019s Wife and Malcolm X. I loved him in Fences and The Great Debators and John Q. I loved him ever since he shared his story about being in a barber shop and a woman sharing with him that he was going to be a star. I loved him when I heard how he helped out Chadwick Boseman, and whenever I remember that he has a marriage in Hollywood that has stood the test of time.\nBut I loved him even more when I saw him, Tyler Perry, Sean \u201cP. Diddy\u201d Combs and Bradley Cooper rally around Will during the commercial break.\n\nWe all need people in our lives who will check up on us and who will hold us accountable in love. I\u2019m thankful for the brotherhood that Will has, and it was heartening to see that most of that brotherhood on display was Black brotherhood.\nClosing: My Grandfather\nI didn\u2019t get to know my maternal grandfather as much as I would\u2019ve liked to, but one thing he always said is that \u201cwhat is joke to you is death to me.\u201d In other words, what you find funny might be killing me softly. I know that there\u2019s been a lot of debate about comedic material and \u201cpolitical correctness.\u201d I guess this is why I could not make a living as a comedian.\n\nIf this triggered a bunch of thoughts within you, that\u2019s okay. This is actually more nuanced than meets the eye, and coating it in laughter and jokes doesn\u2019t suddenly make it better.\n", "comment_count": 7, "like_count": 94, "created_time": 1648486286599, "comment": [{"user_id": "a4c119efd823", "comment_time": 1648486286599, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "bd065a01793d", "comment_time": 1648616600537, "comment": "This entire essay could be highlight but this line is most beautiful and impactful.

After a gaffe about being proud of her country, and being chastised for her humbling remarks about her husband and commentary on what it\u2019s like being married to him, not to mention talk of a \u201cterrorist fist jab\u201d and being called an \u201cape in heels\u201d and \u201cangry\u201d, she had to tone down her image in order to be palatable to the American populace \u2014 a palate more used to blandness than it was to Blackness.\nThey did it to Kamala Harris.\nDespite a fly making a home on his head, Mike Pence continued to interrupt Harris during the Vice Presidential debates, to the point where she had to ever-so gently, but sternly (and with a smile!), remind the former Vice President several times that she had the floor and that she was indeed, \u201cspeaking.\u201d Many noted the tightrope she had to walk at that moment as potentially the nation\u2019s first Black, Asian and female Vice President.\n\n\u201cHarris\u2019 face flashed a catalogue of looks in his direction that seemed to communicate irritation, disbelief and distaste all at once, the kind of repertoire developed when one often cannot say everything one thinks,\u201d wrote Janell Ross, MSNBC News.\nWe who are female and ebony-hued all recognize why she couldn\u2019t have actually said what was on her mind and say it in the way she wanted to say it, as Michele Norris explains:\n\u201cIf Harris had raised her voice in those moments, she would have been labeled shrill. If she had frowned, she would have been labeled a scold. If she had raised a hand, she would have been called angry or even unhinged.\n\u201cSo she smiled as she held her ground \u2014 and of course they called it a smirk, a grin that by definition comes off as irritating or smug. But it was more than that. Harris gave Pence \u201cThe Look\u201d \u2014 and you don\u2019t have to look up that phrase to know exactly what I mean.\n\u201cBlack women have elevated the \u201cMama don\u2019t take no mess\u201d expression to a form of high art \u2014 a narrowing of the eye, a lift of the eyebrow, a tilt of the head. Sometimes there is a sideways arch of the neck, a molasses-slow movement of the jaw that says, without speaking, \u2018You\u2019ve got exactly 10 seconds to pick up your feet and run for the hills.\u2019\n\u201cSome of this is the stuff of caricature. The kind of thing that leads Black women to be called sassy, volatile, aggressive or angry. All of that is an effort to dismiss or demean. But that attempted erasure is the very reason Black women \u2014 indeed, most women \u2014 have some version of The Look in their arsenal.\u201d\nI think Jill Filipovic summed up the events of that evening quite aptly:\n\u201cPence repeatedly interrupted Harris, something she rarely did to him; he repeatedly talked over moderator Susan Page of USA Today when she told him his time was up; he repeatedly flouted the rules he had previously agreed to. The disrespect of women was tangible, and it happened over and over.\n\u201cHarris had no such leeway to bulldoze either her opponent or the moderator. As a black woman on the national stage, she knew she had to walk a thread-thin line: Be likable, but authoritative; strong, but not \u2018aggressive\u2019. Interrupting Pence or even Page posed serious \u2014 and sexist \u2014 consequences with an electorate that has never seen a woman in the White House. But for better or worse, Harris is used to the Trump circus, and so she walked that tightrope deftly. She was tough, assertive, funny and charming, while Pence was patronizing and stiff.\u201d\nNow, we witness Ketanji Brown Jackson sport the same \u201ccatalogue of looks\u201d and for very much the same reasons as mentioned above.\n\n\nIt\u2019s a \u201cglaring body of evidence\u201d of that scintillating cocktail of racism, sexism and misogynoir.\nI hope you\u2019re watching this. I hope you see this. I hope you see that this is a pattern with Black women \u2014 accomplished, educated, often overly qualified Black women. I hope you see this, especially all those who claim we live in some kind of \u201cpost-racial\u201d world (As a side-note, I take issue with now common and contemporary usage of the word \u201cpost.\u201d \u201cPost-racial\u201d\u2026 \u201cPost-COVID\u201d\u2026 people are so ready to move forward and get past without having done the hard, slow work of truth, reconciliation, healing and reflection). I hope you see this, those of you who still respond with \u201call lives matter\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t see colour.\u201d\nI hope you finally see colour. In fact, I hope you see this in full technicolour on your TV screens and are willing to finally admit that this is actually one of the very few things in life that are Black and White. Literally.\nBut first, let\u2019s go back down memory lane, shall we?\nFirst, it was the LSAT scores. Well, it was the first for us but probably not the first for her. I don\u2019t think one would be wrong in assuming that to be a successful Black woman at this point in her career has undoubtedly meant facing misogynoir \u2014 sometimes subtle, sometimes overt \u2014 from colleagues and establishments alike. So I would imagine, while annoying and bothersome and sometimes saddening, this is unfortunately not terra nova for her.\nBut back to the LSAT. Anyone who has ever taken the LSAT will tell you that it is not a test of aptitude. It tests the skills that one will eventually learn in law school, like reading comprehension, critical thinking and analytical reasoning (it\u2019s weird like that). That\u2019s why scoring low on the LSAT doesn\u2019t mean anything, and scoring high on the LSAT means little, except maybe one has a natural knack for this kind of stuff and perhaps more access to tutoring, time to study and money for Kaplan exam prep classes. The same thing goes for the bar. I know people who have failed the bar and still went on to have successful careers (like myself *flips hair*). I know someone who got into law school off of the waitlist the week before class started who is now a nationally acclaimed human rights lawyer. We also know that, statisically speaking, people of colour and Black people have disproportionally lower bar success rates and often have lower LSAT scores, which calls into question the validity of the LSAT or bar exam as a test of knowledge let alone competence. To get into an Ivy League law school, one must have scored at least in the 90th to 95th percentile. Anyone who has actually gone to law school and is humble and honest enough to admit it will tell you categorically that none of the standardized tests and hoops that the machination that is the legal profession puts you through has any bearing on one\u2019s lawyering \u2014 that is, on whether one will be a good lawyer or not. A good lawyer is guided by moral principles, shaped by mentorship and undergirded by passion and work ethic, and the LSAT simply doesn\u2019t test that.\nSo it\u2019s so\u2026ummm interesting\u2026 that someone (*cough* Tucker Carlson *cough*) who has not taken the LSAT or at least has gone to law school (one\u2019s ignorance is glaring, let alone showing) asks someone with decades of experience on the bench what her LSAT score was.\nI can\u2019t recall anyone asking Barrett or Kavanaugh or even Thomas for their LSAT scores. But sure \u2014 let\u2019s ask the first Black woman to be nominated to the Supreme Court of the United States.\nLet me remind you how qualified Jackson actually is. Credit: New York Times\nThen there are the actual Senate confirmation hearings.\n\nThe questions these Republican senators (who happen to be White and overwhelmingly male) have asked are asinine, to say the least. It would be funny if it weren\u2019t so tragic.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s been an almost insulting fiasco of people waving books they haven\u2019t read or going on a long emotional diatribe that has nothing to do with the matter at hand (pornography?). I understand that both Cruz and Jackson were classmates at Harvard Law. And yet the discrepancy in intelligence and reading comprehension is\u2026well\u2026it leaves me in awe.\n\n\n\n\nAt the very least I too would have looked at these senators with the same bewilderment and puzzlement that Jackson did, utterly in awe of these vapid questions and inane, ill attempts at discrediting her. At most, I would have been tempted to be petty and snarky. I would have asked Sen. Blackburn if she considered herself a woman, and if so, why so. I would have asked several of these Senators to get to the point. But women, and especially Black women, aren\u2019t afforded such luxuries of snark and curtness.\nI mean, for one thing, little Black girls are always getting arrested for less (see here, here, here, and here). Our mere presence is threatening. When we exist and breathe, we are seen as danger, let alone when we actually open our mouths.\nWe constantly have to be twice as good to get half of much, and even then still get questioned by those who have but a scintilla of our qualifications.\n\n\nWhen Conney Barrett was confirmed, Sen. Joni Ernst told Barrett that opponents were \u201cattacking your faith and your precious family \u2026 attacking you as a mom and a woman of faith\u201d (I don\u2019t recall Republican Senators praising Jackson for her twenty-five-year marriage to a surgeon that has produced two beautiful children. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong). At times, Barrett even got a little bit \u201cfeisty.\u201d She too had to toe the line of being a woman, but as a White woman, she could afford feistiness. Her Whiteness afforded her enough racial currency.\nKavanaugh literally broke into a tearful tirade during his confirmation, and with a credible witness like Professor Christine Blasey Ford, there\u2019s reason to believe he is a sexual predator. He launched into a spectacle of tears a la Kyle Rittenhouse. But he\u2019s White and male, so it wasn\u2019t held against him.\nThomas had already besmirched the reputation of Anita Hill and basically accused Senators of racism at his hearing. But he\u2019s male, and although Black, when questioned by a majority of men, you can bank on your maleness to get you through.\nBlack women, however, must always be poised, professional and composed. My male colleagues encourage me to \u201cwrite with my penis.\u201d But what they fail to realize is that if I write with my penis I will be penalized for not being palatable because of patriarchy. And because of patriarchy, if we speak from hurt, we are hysterical. And God forbid if we are rightfully incensed. Because of the toxicity of misogynoir, our righteous indignation is dismissed as being tantrums from yet another angry Black woman. No one cares to ask why we are angry in the first place.\nI cannot act like a man because I am not a man and do not benefit from his privilege. I cannot act White because I am not White. I cannot act with the entitlement and audaciousness of a White person. I am often reminded that my existence is permitted and not inherent. Nor can I act like a White woman because I am not a White woman. No one capitulates and cowers and comes to my aid when I cry. And so I must re-read my e-mails to make sure they strike the right tone, I must speak in a measured, almost unemotional way and I must watch myself for fear of coming off as acerbic and aggressive instead of assertive, mordacious as opposed to syrupy, saccharine, sweet and unintimidating.\n\nThis smiling at stupidity is exhausting. The code-switching is exhausting. The being \u201ctwice as good\u201d is exhausting. And yet it is the mantle many Black women carry as they strive to thrive under White supremacy and patriarchy. It is the double consciousness of which Frantz Fanon and W.E.B DuBois opined, the latter stating, \u201calways looking at one\u2019s self through the eyes\u201d of a racist white society and \u201cmeasuring oneself by the means of a nation that looked back in contempt.\u201d\n\u201cIt is a peculiar sensation, this double-consciousness, this sense of always looking at one\u2019s self through the eyes of others, of measuring one\u2019s soul by the tape of a world that looks on in amused contempt and pity. One ever feels his two-ness, \u2014 an American, a Negro; two souls, two thoughts, two unreconciled strivings; two warring ideals in one dark body, whose dogged strength alone keeps it from being torn asunder.\u201d \u2014 W.E.B. DuBois, The Souls of Black Folk\nIt is the double jeopardy or even the triple consciousness (see here and here) of being Black, a woman and an American.\n\nIt\u2019s about existing and having to constantly be worried about how we are perceived. For many, perception and appearances is a mere matter of aesthetic, of professionalism. For the rest of us, it can be a matter of life or death.\nAnd so it is so frustrating to see a woman of Jackson\u2019s calibre being interrogated like this. And yet Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, for the sake of her confirmation and her credibility, is expected to remain stoic. I agree that those who judge should be rightly subjected to judgment. But they shouldn\u2019t be subjected to this level of indignity.\nKetanji Brown Jackson cannot afford to show exasperation or irritation. Neither can Michelle Obama or Kamala Harris. It is the burden of being a Black woman and also the burden of being the first \u2014 first Black First Lady, first Black (and female) Vice President, first Black female Supreme Court Justice. It is heavy, oppressive and unfair, but having them assume this yoke hopefully makes carrying the yoke easier for those who follow. And yet, in the mire of exhaustion, and especially for Jackson, just know that your tired Black sisters around the world will be exasperated in your stead, rolling our eyes, giving screw face and kissing our teeth in your place, hoisting you up in solidarity because of your excellence.\n\n\u00a9 Simone Samuels, 2022", "comment_count": 7, "like_count": 280, "created_time": 1648055958453, "comment": [{"user_id": "a4c119efd823", "comment_time": 1648055958453, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "9e63addeddc1", "comment_time": 1648343168504, "comment": "This is a much needed perspective because it perfectly sums up one of many experiences unique to Black women."}, {"user_id": "c524bac6b23c", "comment_time": 1648614891322, "comment": "And cussin' those sons of bitches out!!"}, {"user_id": "ccb86a0c63b1", "comment_time": 1648169857869, "comment": "Great article.

The greatest accretion of shareholder value from 2015 to 2025 has been / will be recurring revenue bundles that decrease choice \u2014 Apple One and Amazon Prime. The biggest mistake marketers make is believing choice is a good thing. It isn\u2019t. Consumers don\u2019t want more choice, but to be more confident in the choices presented.\n\nIt took Apple 42 years to get to $1 trillion in value, and then five months to get to $2 trillion despite no increase in earnings and anemic growth. It now trades at 35x earnings vs. an average of 16x over the last 10 years. Much of the recasting of Apple is due to a move to recurring revenue, which now accounts for 22% of top-line. Since launching Amazon Prime, and establishing a monogamous relationship with 82% of US households, Amazon has likely added the value of all other retail in the U.S. and Europe ($1.5 trillion).\nTrain yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose.\n\u2014 Yoda\nIn a low-growth economy, the gangster way to register a sustainable increase in shareholder value is a move to a rundle (my term for \u201ca recurring revenue bundle\u201d).\n\nApple boasts the greatest asset in the consumer world, the iPhone. However, the greatest collection of consumer assets assembled under one corporate roof is also the firm that stands to recognize the greatest accretion in stakeholder value with an aggressive move to a rundle. Simply put, it\u2019s time to unleash the Mouse. Disney+ needs to bust a move to Disney\u00b2.\nThe assets here are staggering, but the whole is less than the sum of the parts. Corporate fiefdoms, compensation structures that inhibit cross-division cooperation, and nausea at the prospect of the short-term earnings hit required to move to a rundle, prevent the Mouse from commanding the space it occupies. The result is a stock that, despite this embarrassment of riches, has underperformed the market.\n\nStocks are a function of the narrative and the numbers. Increasingly, the narrative drives the valuation across equities that outperform the market \u2014 a phenomenon my colleague Aswath Damodaran refers to as \u201cstory stocks.\u201d Recently, Disney has lost control of the narrative, and CNBC has become obsessed with the cyclical downturn of the parks\u2026 and forcing female anchors to wear sleeveless dresses. Why does Joe Kernen get to cover his arms? Btw, I\u2019d pay cash money to see Andrew Ross Sorkin\u2019s milky, sublime deltoids. But I digress.\nCNBC fails to realize business travel has registered structural decline, but resort/family travel declines are cyclical and will experience a flight to quality. Disney parks are singular and will reflate, dramatically. In addition, the Disney communications department is infected with an old-world virus \u2014 integrity. Disney consistently under-promises and over-delivers, not acknowledging that the way of the Force is to over-promise (\u201cWe\u2019ll have 1 million autonomous Tesla taxis on the road within 12 months\u201d).\nThe narrative that has put Disney on its heels also ignores the most successful media property launch in history, Disney+. Put another way, Disney is the best storyteller in history. However, Disney Inc. is one of the worst.\n\nThe Disney\u00b2 rundle would be unrivaled:\nD\u00b2 member-only access to parks \u2014 special events, fewer crowds\nD\u00b2 member-only cruises, proprietary itineraries/ports of call\nTentpole films delivered for in-home viewing at D\u00b2 households seven days before release in theaters, turning the cadence of film releases on its head\nAlgorithmic modeling that sends families merchandise their kids want automatically (viewership of The Mandalorian = Baby Yoda figurine)\nAccess to artisanal events/media including Marvel cruises, Princess Cinderella experience, video birthday wishes from Rey, etc.\nPotentially layer in access to ESPN+\nEdutainment (the profound opportunity): Who is better at capturing and sustaining a child\u2019s attention than Disney? Disney should launch a (remote) educational product for kids in grades K-12.\nThe market opportunity is substantial. There are 140.8 million primary and secondary school-age children in the U.S., Japan, and the EU. That\u2019s approximately 84.5 million families with kids K-12 (assuming 1.93 kids per family in the U.S.; 1.55 kids per family in the EU; 1.44 kids per family in Japan).\nIf we assume D\u00b2 has an addressable market on par with Amazon Prime memberships: 82% of American families with kids K-12, 50% EU families with kids, and 40% of Japanese families with kids translates to 52 million households/subscribers. At $50 a month (would any parent have a real choice?), this is a potential $30 billion a year recurring revenue business.\nThe multiple on these revenues (6\u201312x) would dramatically overcompensate for the decline in advertising and affiliate revenues lost as a function of sequestering content and assets to D\u00b2 members. Much of the value accretion would occur even before the realization of the potential, as vision and growth, in this market, pull valuations forward. Disney stands to recognize a doubling in market capitalization on a short-term decline in revenues, but only if the move is bold.\nDisney has a meaningful opportunity to increase shareholder value with a crisp move to a rundle. However, the profound opportunity is to provide children with compelling edutainment that addresses one of the greatest challenges presented by Covid-19: the disturbingly high number of children from low-income households falling behind in remote learning is a threat to the future of the U.S.\n\n50% of low-income kids are falling behind in school as a function of a K-shaped recovery where lower-income households don\u2019t have internet access or a stay-at-home parent. The result is an educational apartheid.\nDisney has the gravitas, capital, and leadership to collide storytelling and education to provide, at no cost, online learning opportunities for our neediest households. It\u2019s likely that a telco and hardware manufacturer would partner with Disney to ensure that the emerging divide is repaired before it becomes permanent.\nIn a dark place we find ourselves, and a little more knowledge lights our way.\n\u2014 Yoda\nUBI to UDI\nJust as Andrew Yang proposed a leveling up via Universal Basic Income, Disney is in a position to lead several firms in an effort to provide Universal Disney Instruction (\u201cUDI\u201d). To be clear, I don\u2019t believe this is structurally sustainable, and we should not depend on companies to solve problems the government should address (educating our children). But we are in a crisis, and the White Moronacy that has infected Pennsylvania Avenue creates a need so great that many/most subscribers to D2 would be willing to sponsor a UDI household. If 50% of children fall off the map in STEM, we are 50% less likely to solve climate change, find vaccines for future pathogens, or develop apps that help us find a mate or the fastest route to an In-N-Out Burger.\nReminiscing\nIn December 2019, I wrote a letter to Omid Kordestani, chairman of Twitter. In the letter, I expressed concern over a part-time CEO planning to move to Africa and suggested Twitter move to a subscription model. I invested 50 years of my salary as a professor in Twitter stock \u2014 purchased 332,000 shares. I didn\u2019t hear back from Omid. Some consolation is his son Milan tweeted at me suggesting I shouldn\u2019t criticize Sheryl Sandberg, as she is the most powerful woman in tech. Milan is an impressive young man \u2014 before the age of 17, he started several media and tech firms, and enjoys raising, riding, and racing horses. Milan and I had similar childhoods, if my childhood had been \u2026 nothing like my childhood. Anyway, I didn\u2019t hear back from Milan\u2019s dad.\nAdditional consolation is that several weeks later, Elliott Management signed my letter with a $2 billion pen and just days later (unprecedented) secured three board seats. Jack reconsidered his move to Africa and, soon after the new directors were seated, Twitter announced they were exploring (wait for it) subscription services. Since the letter, Twitter stock is up 55%. To be clear, Twitter suffered from poor strategy and execution, and a negligent board that tolerated a part-time CEO. In contrast, I have nothing but admiration for Disney management and a culture that producers great leaders. I don\u2019t know Mr. Chapek, but believe Mr. Iger is twice the leader Jack Dorsey is, every day. A nose ring and silent retreats are not a reason to abdicate responsibility for a rage machine that continues to damage our psyches and discredit our institutions. Btw, I know Messrs. Chapek and Iger are reading this, as 93 people at Disney subscribe to these missives.\nSo, a prediction. Within six months, someone with a much bigger pen will sign this post. There is an opportunity for this to be your idea and pull a Mulan here \u2014 go straight to video, take back the narrative, and under the cover of the reduced earnings due to Covid, announce Disney is making an aggressive move to a bold rundle and announce a UDI plan.\nIn sum:\nForget what you know;\nCommand the space you occupy; and\nUnleash the Mouse.\nLife is so rich,\nScott\nP.S.

I\u2019ve served on the boards of seven public companies. In December 2019 I took a stake (approx .03% the size of Elon\u2019s ownership) in Twitter and wrote a public letter to the board, highlighting the company\u2019s lack of innovation and weak shareholder returns, and calling on them to replace part-time CEO Jack Dorsey. I received no response. Shocker. Although the chairman\u2019s son tweeted at me that I shouldn\u2019t be so harsh on Sheryl Sandberg. So \u2026 there\u2019s that. A few months later, Elliott Management, a large activist fund, called me and said they were signing my letter with a $2 billion pen. They bought a significant stake in the company and secured two board seats in record time, as the directors realized they\u2019d been acting like sycophants vs. actual fiduciaries. Once Elliott had representatives on the board, @jack was gone. It was just a matter of optics and cadence to make it appear as if it was his idea \u2014 ego still drives the majority of decisions around corporate governance. (And war.)\nElliott has done Twitter\u2019s shareholders \u2014 and corporate governance \u2014 a service advocating for the crazy idea that the CEO should work full time. @jack is a great CEO of Block, but he was a shitty absentee father at Twitter.\nThe Song Remains the Same\nTwitter\u2019s fundamental problems remain, however, and by early this year its shares had retreated back below $40. I began (again) meeting with funds to discuss taking a position and advocating for change. My pitch: Twitter is among the most important products in history (real-time news source, global communications platform), yet it remains a lackluster investment.\nThe company flounders in a cesspool of ad-supported media, sacrificing quality for attention in the pursuit of profits it will never realize. Twitter defines the term \u201csubscale\u201d in a digital landscape where three giants command 80\u00a2 of the digital dollar: Google, Meta, and Amazon.\n\nTwitter\u2019s inability to monetize is reflected in its valuation. In late January, before Elon started buying, the stock was trading at a significant discount to Meta and Snap.\n\nWhat to Do\nTwitter should move to a subscription model (#fuckingobvious). Corporate users and users with large followings would pay for a fraction of the value they receive. I have long advocated for this model; by shifting the company\u2019s revenue source from advertisers to users, subscription aligns economic incentives with user experience, rather than user exploitation. This leads to a myriad of benefits, which is why recurring-revenue businesses register greater growth and retention and bigger valuations.\n\nNothing better illustrates the value of Twitter to its users than Tesla. The carmaker spends almost nothing on advertising (GM spends $2+ billion per year), yet it has built the best brand in the industry. This is a function of performance (outstanding products, exceeding targets) multiplied by reach. The reach is a function of Elon\u2019s 80.9 million PR agents (i.e., his Twitter followers). The social network could charge Mr. Musk $10 million a month and \u2014 after making a series of ad hominem attacks on the board/company/CEO \u2014 he would pay it. Nearly every Fortune 10,000 company and A/B/C list celebrity who uses the platform as a real-time communications tool would pay fees scaled by follower count.\nIn addition, ad-supported media is what drives the enragement cycle, the bots, and the misinformation plaguing Twitter. Cleaning that up would be good for business, and for the commonwealth. False stories on Twitter are 70% more likely to be retweeted than true ones \u2014 and spread six times faster.\nOn the basis of this pitch, I had soft-circled substantial capital. We were working through this crazy thing called SEC rules and regulations. How would we structure the special purpose vehicle? What were the Hart-Scott-Rodino requirements if one capital source provided more than 50% of the investment? Would my background advocating for change mean we\u2019d need to file a 13D (active) vs. 13G (passive)? You know, \u201cthe law.\u201d\nBy early April we\u2019d spent the better part of a month sorting through these issues. But TWTR was suddenly on a tear, up 20% in two weeks. The market had perceived the shape of a whale moving beneath the surface. My team speculated that another big activist fund was accumulating a position and we updated our models. Then the whale breached.\n\nEnter Elon\nTo be clear, there\u2019s a lot to like here. Elon correctly saw the opportunity and seized it. Twitter was dramatically undervalued and should be better. And the board was smart to embrace him and give him a seat. The easiest way to silence an activist is to make them an insider. Corporate governance is out of fashion in an era of dual-class public stock and a dangerous diminution of government. But Twitter is 2 for 2 in recent months, showing Jack the door and putting a large shareholder on the board.\nIn addition, Musk is a genius. He leads two companies that are simultaneously revolutionizing important industries. Tesla makes the world\u2019s best cars and has accelerated industry adoption of electric vehicles by years. The same day he disclosed his Twitter stake, Tesla announced record shipments. But in my view, Tesla isn\u2019t even his most impressive company. SpaceX\u2019s reusable rockets are fundamentally changing the economics of space hauling, core to our future infrastructure. In sum, we have the preeminent entrepreneur of his generation, who\u2019s taken a seat on the board of a company that needs to command the space it occupies.\nGlass Half Empty\nBut\u2026\nFor starters, Musk\u2019s track record is mixed when it comes to errant distractions from the businesses he\u2019s responsible for. Over the past several years, he\u2019s been reckless, toying with companies, cryptocurrencies, and technologies that captured his fleeting attention only to move on when the next shiny object caught his gaze.\n\nTo date, Elon\u2019s stated objectives for Twitter are vague, and clearly bullshit. His main beef with Twitter, it appears, is there\u2019s too much moderation.\n\nWhere to begin? Some basic law: Free speech is essential to a functioning democracy, but free speech is a protection from government limits on speech. Free speech doesn\u2019t limit Twitter \u2026 it protects Twitter. Rigorous adherence to the principle of free speech means Twitter shapes its own voice, which, if it decides, is not amplifying hate speech, false speech, or speech calling for insurrection. Users who want that content can find it elsewhere, such as 4chan, or Truth Social (not really \u2026 DOA). Free speech principles are government principles, just as censorship is government action. Everything else is competing speech.\nMoreover, Twitter is an important space for communication, but \u201cfree speech principles\u201d and \u201cdemocracy\u201d do not require or even suggest that Twitter let anyone say anything. On the contrary, they militate for reasonable moderation. An unfettered forum is not free, it\u2019s an invitation to mob rule. If Twitter is the \u201cde facto public square,\u201d that\u2019s because the site moderates content, not despite its efforts to do so. Almost nobody wants unfettered speech on Twitter. Imagine your email inbox but with no spam filters \u2026 times 280. Moderation is why 4chan gets 20 million users per month, while Twitter gets 217 million users per day.\nIn practice, Elon\u2019s interest in \u201cfree speech\u201d has been mostly about intimidating journalists who wouldn\u2019t be stenographers for his unfounded claims. His solution was a website where people could vote up or down on journalists, where the magic of crowds would fix media. He wanted to call it Pravda. Today, Pravda, like so many Elon missives, is long forgotten, and Elon\u2019s answer to the problems facing Twitter is: \u201cSomething \u2026 something \u2026 open source.\u201d\n\nThis echoes a long-standing interest by @Jack and others at Twitter, including new CEO Parag Agrawal, in a future version of Twitter that\u2019s \u201cdecentralized.\u201d A web3 Twitter, if you will. Specifics are absent \u2014 it\u2019s easier to vomit a buzzy word salad. Users will be able to configure their own moderation, no centralized authority, all the same crypto-web3-decentralized BS that has resulted in few real products or services, but has secured billions of dollars for VCs and (other) grifters. The notion that hundreds of millions of Twitter users are all going to tinker with their personal moderation algorithm is as likely as people connecting directly to the blockchain with their handheld phone.\nOpening Twitter to outside parties could be powerful, and there\u2019s potential for a new architecture that would let different flavors of Twitter evolve. That\u2019s the idea behind Bluesky, which Twitter created and funds. But a) Twitter is already pursuing this, they don\u2019t need Elon on the board for it; and b) there\u2019s no commercially viable version of Twitter without moderation. Whatever emerges from Bluesky, it will still need centralized entities that filter content and make judgment calls, or the system collapses into chaos.\nWild West\nMusk\u2019s call for a Wild West version of Twitter isn\u2019t surprising, as it\u2019s consistent with an emerging Valley ideology I label \u201ctakerist.\u201d Takerists view the commonwealth as a hunting ground for personal enrichment and amusement vs. a community invested in mutual prosperity. The great taste of community \u2014 roads and charge stations, EV tax credits, air traffic control for Gulfstream 650 ERs, public universities that graduate engineers \u2014 with none of the calories \u2014 taxes, laws, the basic comity of man.\nTrue to Form\nWe found out Elon was Twitter\u2019s largest shareholder on Monday morning, because that\u2019s when he disclosed his holdings to the SEC, as required of anyone who acquires more than 5% of a public company. Only Elon filed the wrong form, and he filed it nearly two weeks late. He filed the form for \u201cpassive\u201d investors \u2014 and if you\u2019ve been talking to the CEO for the past few weeks about joining the board and changing the product, you are not a \u201cpassive\u201d investor.\nElon filed the correct form (Schedule 13D) the next day, but it requires more fulsome disclosures, which revealed he had crossed the 5% threshold on March 14. Meaning he\u2019d been obligated to disclose his stake back on March 24. By illegally concealing his stake for 11 days, Musk was able to continue buying shares from sellers who didn\u2019t know he was accumulating a huge position. Had he disclosed his shares properly on March 24, TWTR would have shot up 25% then, instead of on April 4, and the shares he bought subsequently would have garnered selling shareholders approximately $150 million more. That\u2019s fraud, and while I have increasingly less confidence in the SEC, Congress has recently beefed up its power to seek disgorgement of ill-gotten gains for securities law violations. Shareholder lawsuits may also be in the offing.\nEven if the SEC acts, $150 million is immaterial to Elon. On a relative basis, his entire $2.5 billion investment in Twitter is about the price of a MacBook for the average household. A $150 million fine is buying an extra charger. Takerists such as Elon are exempt from the law \u2014 they can buy their own. The rest of us would be left with a Musk-flavored Twitter, which would look similar to the replies to his announcement: a septic tank of crypto scams, far-right blather, and screeching wokeism. For all his complaints about \u201cfree speech,\u201d Elon has always been able to speak his mind. Or if not, what hasn\u2019t he said?\n\nWhat\u2019s Next?\nWhatever we think of Elon\u2019s move, he\u2019s made it, and the future of an increasingly important media company is increasingly up to him. He \u201conly\u201d owns 9%, but his influence far exceeds that. Even on a strong board (vs. one that would tolerate a CEO on permanent safari), a mega-billionaire celebrity will command outsized influence.\nAs with all things Elon, it\u2019s the Elon show (unless/until he gets bored and moves on to the next shiny object). Pop quiz: Name somebody else who works at Tesla, SpaceX, or The Boring Company.\nElon bumped the stock, but he\u2019s also likely removed any takeover premium. His antics and wealth make him a human poison pill \u2014 neither a financial buyer nor a strategic acquirer wants to deal with the chaos and unpredictable behavior he brings. And Elon himself signed away his right to buy more when he joined the board. The market sensed these issues and, after its initial explosive gains, the stock began to check back.\nPrediction: Even the flaccid SEC has to do something here \u2026 and that will be an unwelcome distraction for the Twitter board.\nInner Child\n20 years ago I joined my first public company board. I was obnoxious, constantly heckling from the cheap seats and more concerned with getting credit for change than increasing stakeholder value. Two decades and seven boards later I\u2019ve finally (I think) embraced what it means to be a fiduciary: to represent the interests of others. Elon is the most brilliant product engineer of this, and likely the last, century. A fraction of that brilliance could transform Twitter. The risk is that his takerism, constant punching down, and cold take on the First Amendment could push Twitter further off course.\nTwitter\u2019s future now comes down to one question: Can Elon Musk\u2019s inner child develop an outer man?\nLife is so rich,\n\nP.S.

The video of the talk went semi-viral on YouTube after a music industry analyst (@boblefsetz) featured it in his newsletter. Soon after, I had a book deal; I was writing this newsletter every week; CNBC, Fox Business, and Bloomberg were calling me for on-air spots all the time; and the firm I\u2019d founded a few years earlier, L2, began growing 60% a year. I built a studio above my garage to handle the pace of livestreams and TV hits. After working my ass off for 25 years, I was an overnight success. The lesson? Our society, for some reason, links credibility with appearance in a video format endorsed by an umbrella brand (i.e., a broadcast network) or millions of views/likes on a platform.\nWhen the pandemic hit, Vice TV convinced me we could do an entire show remotely, from that home studio. My wife cried after she saw the first episode. And not good tears. More like \u201cI am deeply disturbed at how bad this is, and what it might mean for our family\u201d kinds of tears. Vice wanted to renew for more episodes \u2026 but I said no. The quality wasn\u2019t there, and I realized that my actions need to match my words: I shouldn\u2019t be producing an ad-supported show while I\u2019m publicly criticizing how advertising is media\u2019s carcinogen. That flummoxed them. Being on TV is an addictive substance, and not many people walk away.\nBloomberg, a firm I admire, asked me to do a show for them. With launch just days away, and four episodes in the can, they asked me to do some promotions for social media. In one, I dressed up/down as a \u201cbitcoin miner\u201d (inspired by David Hodo\u2019s construction-worker character from the Village People) and tweeted it out. Twitter liked it, and so did the Bloomberg execs, at first. But the video offended one, or more (still not sure) people in the newsroom, and management asked me to clarify that they hadn\u2019t approved the video (true) and to apologize. I refused as \u2026 I wasn\u2019t sorry. The execs were generous with me and wanted to figure out a way forward. However, after meeting with my team, we decided that if we couldn\u2019t do what we do, the juice wasn\u2019t worth the squeeze. So we were canceled (sort of) before the show aired.\nJeff Zucker from CNN offered me a program on its upcoming streaming network (CNN+). I told Jeff what had happened at Bloomberg; he told me he realized his newsroom was not America and said he would protect me. I can see why he fostered such deep loyalty from the people he worked with. So we\u2019ve spent the past few months building our show: No Mercy No Malice with Scott Galloway. So far, CNN+ is a dramatic step change from anything we\u2019ve done previously in terms of depth of talent and resources.\nFailing Forward\nSo, how did this train keep running long enough to carry me to CNN? There are 115 billion reasons. Specifically, that\u2019s how many dollars streaming companies are investing in content this year (plus another $25 billion for sports rights), greater than the defense budget of Germany. This has enabled me, so far, to fail forward. What\u2019s happened here is a decent metaphor for an art form that\u2019s drawn more capital than the combined discretionary budgets for the U.S. departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Justice, Labor, and Transportation.\n\nState of Play\nIn 1998, 55 million people gathered around the TV to watch Titanic win Best Picture. In 2022, 15 million TV viewers watched Coda win. However, on their phones, hundreds of millions saw one millionaire assault another millionaire and then receive an award and a standing ovation. It\u2019s hard to imagine seven seconds that reflect more poorly on America and the age. Maybe January 6, or the former President mocking a disabled person. OK, there\u2019s been several, but that\u2019s not what this post is about. This was the second-least viewed Oscars ceremony ever.\n\nHollywood used to be the cultural center of the universe. It\u2019s fallen to a close second behind the tech community. The two have a lot in common: Both mix fame and money to create a brazen lack of grace and self-awareness. Perhaps the Academy is the ultimate validation of Netflix\u2019s long-tail strategy: It\u2019s been decades since we saw Best Picture nominees regularly appear in the box office top 10. This year the combined earnings of the 10 nominees were a quarter of the new Spider-Man\u2019s 2021 domestic box office haul of $800 million. Action movies (which are overwhelmingly comic book movies) and adventure movies (aka Star Wars spinoffs) now account for two-thirds of global box office revenue. Many years, the box office top 10 consists entirely of pre-existing IP.\n\nWhile movie theaters have completed their transformation into genre palaces, billions have gone into \u201csmall\u201d screen content for screens that are increasingly bigger. And on the streaming side of the entertainment divide, Big Tech continues to roll. In just the past three years, Netflix has created 1,298 original titles, and it\u2019s received more Oscar nominations than any other studio over that span. The Best Picture award this year went to a company that makes phones, two weeks after Amazon completed an $8.5 billion deal to buy one of the most storied movie studios in Hollywood (home to Bond, Rocky, and Thelma & Louise).\n\nProceed With Caution\nIt\u2019s been a phenomenal run for streaming. But as the public and private markets are starting to learn, all runs come to an end. Netflix got a taste of this in January, when it reported its subscriber growth had slowed. The stock dove 22% on the news, setting into motion a larger retreat. Apple and Amazon are immune, because they\u2019re not in the streaming business per se \u2014 they use their entertainment offerings as a means of differentiation, vs. an actual business that needs to be profitable. FYI, this is supposed to be one of the reasons we have antitrust laws. But I digress.\n\nUser growth at all costs is great until your user base is too big to grow. The streamers know this, which is why they\u2019re looking for revenue in new places. Specifically: advertising. Disney+ is releasing a lower-priced tier with ads, HBO is experimenting with pre-roll commercials, and Netflix (for whom ads have historically been verboten) has developed a new stance: \u201cNever say never.\u201d And, in a move that has the same risk profile as New Coke, it looks as if Netflix is cracking down on password sharing.\nFinal Frontier(s)\nTwo frontiers remain: news and live sports. What trucks are to U.S. auto manufacturers, news and sports are to the cable and broadcast markets. They still account for more than 62% of Americans\u2019 total TV consumption.\n\nThe streamers have been nibbling at sports. Hulu tried leveraging its parent\u2019s access to ESPN, Peacock tried paywalling the Olympics, and Amazon bought its way into Thursday Night Football.\nNow CNN+ is asking the important question: Are people down to pay for better TV news? And to be clear, it is better \u2014 not as a function of what it offers, but what it doesn\u2019t offer: advertising.\nStreamed news is built on a novel proposition: Pay for what you get. U.S. news broadcasting has long been subsidized \u2014 neither we nor the ads we watch cover the costs. In the era of the Big Three, the nightly broadcasts that defined \u201cTV news\u201d for generations of Americans were money losers, but the networks invested the profits of prime-time sitcoms and daytime soaps into them to burnish their brands. \u201cI have Jack Benny to make money,\u201d the head of CBS told his news division.\nSince 1967 the federal government has funded PBS and other stations, with a mission to deliver unbiased journalism throughout the nation. Cable news stations enjoyed subsidy by bundle: Sure, you really wanted ESPN and the Comedy Channel, but you were going to pay for Fox News and MSNBC, like it or not. Today news is bundled with data-harvesting \u2014 86% of Americans consume news on a digital device, with 1 in 3 getting it from Facebook and 1 in 5 getting it from YouTube. In sum, we don\u2019t have much experience paying for the most important content we consume.\nIt\u2019s possible, however, that America is done with misinformation posing as news on social platforms \u2014 and this could be the wind in CNN+\u2019s sails. Yes, you can still find CNN content on Facebook, but your diet there is determined by the algorithm, which wants to enrage vs. inform you. The streaming option (CNN+) feeds our digital habit with a diet shaped by an editorial board of journalists. The cable news players are also guilty of relying on novelty and opinion to keep you around until the next ad for an opioid-induced constipation medication.\nThe move from news to novelty, networks attacking each other, and the assigning of news brands to identity and politics has been accompanied by an enormous erosion in trust.\n\nPutting cable in our pocket also means untethering networks from cable\u2019s soft tissue. Specifically, the clock and the need to communicate a certain amount of news regardless of how much news there is that day. Streaming fixes this. Slow business day? Five-minute segment. Superpower invades sovereign nation? Three-hour special. This might also disincentivize the network from creating extraordinary headlines about unextraordinary events. We can discuss this tomorrow in The Situation Room. I hear Fox\u2019s streaming platform is being rebranded The Panic Room.\nOne thing that could hold CNN+ back is it hasn\u2019t gone all-in, and it likely never will. Cable news is trapped in a classic Innovator\u2019s Dilemma. Which is why Anderson Cooper is still on the network (in addition to CNN+): Putting AC completely behind a paywall risks the serious cabbage that reverse mortgage brokers and statin manufacturers pay to interrupt him. Media successes tend to be pure-play, all-in affairs: In the cable era, ESPN, CNN, and HBO were new ventures. Netflix is the king of streaming scripted content; Facebook, Instagram, Snap, and Twitter rule social. Not a brand extension in the lot.\nI suspect we\u2019re going to get a read on CNN+ crisply. CNN is part of WarnerMedia, which AT&T is in the process of selling to Discovery (the complex deal closes Tuesday, April 5). Warner is the much larger entity, however, so AT&T shareholders will end up with 71% of the resulting Warner Bros. Discovery. And that AT&T legacy shareholder base didn\u2019t buy AT&T stock to own the cash flow from Jake Tapper\u2019s Book Club. (OK, that\u2019s a bit passive aggressive \u2014 his show is trending above mine according to the app. Anyway \u2026 ) You own AT&T for predictable results and reliable dividends.\nBut to compete in streaming, Warner Bros. Discovery is going to have to make big bets. Expect a lot of legacy shareholders to bail, putting downward pressure on the stock. WBD will also inherit a sizable debt load from AT&T, which could inhibit the company\u2019s flexibility around investment. All of which adds up to one thing: Management needs quick wins. Signs of traction could result in a streaming-like multiple; anemic results could make it an easy cost-cutting target for a new owner or activist. Few explorers don\u2019t encounter rough seas or bears. But CNN+ has big sails and decent wind. Beneath the tribal noise we make about our preferred cable brands, the world still turns to CNN in a crisis. Viewership jumped by a third after Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine. Ted Turner\u2019s company has never stopped investing in the muscle fibers needed to command that space: Four thousand employees work in 39 editorial operations around the world. Plus AC, Doc G, C Pour, C Dub, the Wolf, and the sexiest bald guy in America \u2014 Stanley Tucci.\nShort and Windy Road\nMy adventures in television have, so far, been short \u2026 and violent.\n\nAs I sit here writing this, my dogs are lying on my lap and my kids are asleep in their beds. One question, present and clear, runs through my head: Why am I doing this? I don\u2019t need the money, and the show will be a small part of my professional endeavors \u2026 that will take a lot of time. I tell people I want to be the most influential thought leader in the history of business and create economic security for the people I work with \u2026 and that involves being multi-channel. It\u2019s mostly bullshit. I probably have more impact through books and teaching, and can make much more money on boards, speaking gigs, investing, etc. Also, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll ever be great at this: I have a face for podcasting, and I share CNN+\u2019s vulnerability \u2014 I\u2019m not all-in here. TV is just something I do \u2026 it\u2019s not what I do.\nSo, why? I think it comes down to death. Specifically, my atheism. I believe this (i.e., our time on Earth) is not a dress rehearsal. This. Is. It. And time is just going so fast. Research shows end-of-life regrets aren\u2019t about the mistakes you made, but the risks you didn\u2019t take. The fears that got in the way of going for it. I have a chance to be on CNN, do something new, and be a part of the art form that defines our age (I believe this). Also, my kids seem impressed, which is nice\u2026and rare. In sum, I don\u2019t know if this will work, if I will enjoy it, or if I\u2019m any good at it. But I\u2019m here, in the moment, living life, trying to avoid regret, and ready for my close-up.\nLife is so rich,\n\nP.S. Maybe you\u2019ll be the one to lead the next innovation in media.

Digitally native, NFTS are (theoretically) lower cost than real estate deeds \u2014 thus they\u2019re economically practical for digital items and lower-value property. Deeds \u2026 for anything. As private property and ownership are central to capitalism, and economic activity increasingly moves online, NFTs may become central to our economy.\nScarcity and Authenticity\nNFTs offer digital commerce something the Internet lacks: scarcity and authenticity. A scarcity mentality is built into us at an instinctual level. Our cravings for sugar and fat (historically scarce) have resulted in an obesity crisis, because our instincts haven\u2019t kept pace with industrial food production. Authenticity\u2019s virtues are practical (we like to know where our food comes from and who we can sue if it makes us sick) and philosophical (if we buy music, is some of the money going to the artist who made it?).\nLimited options for credible scarcity and authenticity have rendered digital commerce chaotic. Napster broke the barriers of scarcity that were inherent to physical distribution of music on plastic discs. The pirating of digital goods of all kinds reduces both tech profitability and long-term innovation. Google put the news media into intensive care by reproducing its content (ending scarcity), and Facebook drove another nail in the coffin by de-emphasizing the source (neutering authenticity).\n\nEnter blockchain. Bitcoin became a trillion-dollar asset class because it cracked this code. A dollar bill is worth $1 because only the U.S. Treasury can make it (authenticity) and we trust Uncle Sam to mint a limited number (scarcity). Bitcoin\u2019s \u201cproof-of-work\u201d system likewise ensures scarcity (there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins produced) and authenticity (all are tracked on an immutable public ledger).\nNFTs offer the promise of scarcity and authenticity for digital goods. NFTs aren\u2019t the only way to create scarcity and authenticity online \u2014 trusted, centralized entities such as banks (and platforms such as Twitter and Apple) do it within their verticals, and blockchain tech is evolving to address myriad environmental and security concerns. So the current implementation of NFTs may not be the best way, or even a good way (many reasons to be skeptical). But they\u2019re \u2026 a way. A potentially widespread, inexpensive way to offer credible scarcity and authenticity online, opening up new vistas of digital commerce. Prospectors are rushing in.\nArt\nThe world beyond crypto-obsessives started paying attention to NFTs a year ago, when digital artist Beeple sold an NFT mosaic of his daily digital images, Everydays, at Christie\u2019s for $69 million. No asset class depends more on scarcity and authenticity than art. The Mona Lisa\u2019s value relies on our belief that there\u2019s only one (scarce); plus, we know it was created by da Vinci (authentic).\nAs deeds do for real estate, a whole industry of galleries, museums, and consultants, along with ancient documents and high-tech gadgets, props up the fine art market. We know this from the failures: A single successful forger, Pei-Shen Qian, formerly of Queens, brought down a 170-year-old art gallery and spawned 10+ lawsuits (and one Alec Baldwin podcast) with his oeuvre of fake Rothkos. NFTs offer a defense against digital forgery. Beeple\u2019s Everydays is authenticated publicly, on the blockchain (and a less cryptic Opensea listing, with legibility brought to you by \u2026 centralization). The lower priced the art, the more it requires a scalable platform for establishing scarcity and authenticity.\nBored Ape\nBored Ape Yacht Club \u2014 a series of JPEGs of monkeys wearing different outfits \u2014 is no more or less risible than any other trend. There are 10,000 of them, each unique, and they\u2019re collectively valued at $3 billion. The floor price for one is $311,000. The company behind les singes ennuy\u00e9s, Yuga Labs, has consolidated its position as the dominant force in NFT-based collectible bubbles, buying up the NFT brands CryptoPunks (bored dudes) and Meebits (bored avatars) and raising $450 million at a $4 billion valuation.\n\nIs this a JPEG ape bubble? Likely. Collectible bubbles are nothing new. Beanie Babies were individually unique, cartoonish figures produced at low cost and brilliantly marketed. In 1997, eBay sold $500 million worth in a month \u2014 6% of the company\u2019s annual sales. Garbage Pail Kids, Cabbage Patch Dolls, animation cells, POGS, tulips \u2014 the list goes on. Some endure, such as vintage baseball cards (outperforming the S&P 500 since 2008). There is a huge market for modestly priced art and un-bubbled collectibles that could benefit from digital scarcity and authenticity. NFTs also offer the potential for creators to collect royalties every time their art is sold in the secondary market, remedying some of the creative economy\u2019s inequities.\nHow long will Bored Apes remain culturally relevant? Don\u2019t know. They are trees, which live and die. Yet the forest is immortal.\nBrands\nFor brands, scarcity and authenticity is everything. Chanel can sell sunglasses for $500 because they\u2019re scarce and they\u2019re Chanel. In exchange, the customer gets to say \u201cI\u2019m aspirational\u201d without saying \u201cI\u2019m aspirational.\u201d But branding goes beyond signaling wealth. Doc Marten boots say something, and Wrangler and Levi\u2019s say something else. Oatly is not milk, but it is a statement about who you are.\nPeople underestimate the power of brands; it\u2019s a lie we tell ourselves. Branded beer tastes better than non-branded beer. Allergy medication is more effective after you watch branded advertisements. Labradoodle vs. Labrador, Star Wars vs. Dragon Ball, iOS vs. Android, NYU vs. Columbia \u2014 we are a tribal species, and we sort ourselves with logos. Logos that we insist are \u201cauthentic,\u201d despite the availability of knock-offs. A robust ecosystem of intellectual property laws and institutions ensures a brand\u2019s owners control scarcity, and NFTs augment that system in the digital economy.\nMany companies are catching on to this in their own socially stunted, corporate, Zuckerbergian way. People want to show up to the Miller Lite metaverse tavern no more than they want to follow Miller Lite\u2019s Instagram page. There\u2019s no doubt that much of the fullness brands give to physical life is missing online.\nBelongings\nEvery morning I put on a Panerai watch to signal my masculinity and success. I haven\u2019t wound it in 10 years. Online I have something even more scarce: A Twitter blue check. The blue check is a digital Panerai (sort of): scarce and authentic, it signals that if you mate with me your kids are more likely to survive than if you couple with someone missing the blue check.\nOne of the keys to NFTs will be portability across mediums. A Twitter blue check can\u2019t exist on Instagram, but the NFT equivalent of a Twitter blue check can \u2014 and deliver credible authenticity, thanks to that NFT deed. This is the metaverse vision of interoperability that could help make digital belongings feel similar to physical belongings.\nDigital belongings exist on the internet, but there aren\u2019t that many types of them. On Fortnite you can acquire guns and outfits. On Reddit you gain badges. Point is: There\u2019s a lot of stuff on the internet, but there isn\u2019t much stuff that\u2019s yours.\nNow ask yourself: How much physical stuff is yours? Think of every item in your house: books, paintings, photos, CDs, heirlooms, trophies, etc. What\u2019s the market value of all that? As our lives move further online, so will our stuff, and we\u2019ll need some sort of infrastructure that allows us to own it.\nMoney Changes Everything\nI\u2019m a capitalist and generally think that functioning markets improve lives. Bringing credible scarcity and authenticity to digital markets is a net positive \u2014 but the key word there is \u201cnet.\u201d The flood of interest in NFTs has predictably resulted in scams and exploits. The market has cooled off recently, with the top corresponding pretty closely to former First Lady Melania Trump\u2019s NFT scam. (She bought her own NFT through shell accounts to create false signals re the value.) When I interviewed Mark Cuban (owner of the Dallas Mavericks), he raised concerns about sports team NFTs injecting a money-making incentive between the fans and the team, replacing the emotional bond they feel with the team and players with the anxiety of a Robin Hood day trader sweating a position.\nScarcity and authenticity are powerful, and not always forces for good. Our instinctual craving for scarce sugar and fat has produced an obesity crisis, but we aren\u2019t going to throw out the industrial food system and live off the land. Amidst the scams and bubbles, credible scarcity and authenticity will unlock real value in digital markets.\nIn sum, Madame First Lady Trump,\nLearn the damn language: scarcity and authenticity.\nLife is so rich,\n\nP.S.

Sound familiar?\nPhoto: Mamie Till-Mobley / Public Domain\nEarlier this year, an old photo of Emmett Till and his mother spread across the internet. Although the picture of Till alive and smiling next to his mother had been seen for decades, its revitalization came from the fact that it wasn\u2019t in black-and-white; the slain boy has seldom been depicted in full color. The teenager\u2019s visible melanin illuminates his smile and adds dimension to his face. The kid who would fall victim to racially motivated kidnapping and torture before a horrific death appears happier and more alive than ever.\nWhile the picture slides another feather into the cap of modern technology, it also reminds us that Till\u2019s murder isn\u2019t ancient history. The travesty didn\u2019t take place during America\u2019s reconstruction or prohibition eras; it occurred in 1955, when many of our parents were children. Yet 66 years later, the ghost of Emmett Till has never once been allowed to rest.\nLast month, in Bend, Oregon, a Black man was murdered by a White man for allegedly complimenting a White woman. On September 19, 22-year-old Barry Washington Jr. was shot and killed by Ian Cranston after supposedly hitting on Cranston\u2019s girlfriend, Allie Butler. The murder took place outside of the Capitol nightclub on the corner of Wall Street and Oregon Avenue, but the incident began inside. Washington first paid a compliment to Butler; the young man\u2019s language nor behavior were inappropriate. Butler\u2019s response was reportedly kind: \u201cI\u2019m flattered, but I\u2019m in a relationship.\u201d\nShortly after midnight, while outside of Capitol, Washington gave Butler an additional compliment, this time infuriating her boyfriend. Cranston approached Washington and a mild scuffle ensued. Cranston, a machinist at a bullet manufacturer who possesses a concealed carrier\u2019s license, pulled out his pistol and shot the unarmed Washington dead.\nInitially, Cranston was arrested on suspicion of second-degree manslaughter. He quickly posted a $10,000 bail. Normally, this is where the White man who commits a heinous act gets treated like a jaywalker. This time was different, though, particularly for two reasons. First, was the presence of what\u2019s been the savior of dignity and provider of justice for Black victims of racial violence at the pale hands of police officers, pick-up truck owners, and assault rifle-carrying teenagers: video footage.\nWhether on Kim Potter in Minneapolis or Garrett Rolfe in Atlanta, body-cams have been the nation\u2019s number one exposer of police misconduct leading to African-American death. It took Rashad West\u2019s security footage to reveal that George Floyd\u2019s actions didn\u2019t warrant suffocation under Derek Chauvin\u2019s knee. While Emmett Till\u2019s murder is less than a century old, only 30 years have passed since Rodney King was savagely beaten by a gang of cops for the world to see, yet starved of justice.\nImagine Carolyn Bryant filming her husband and brother-in-law mutilate Emmett before shooting him in the head and dumping his body in the Tallahatchie River. Well, welcome to 2021.\nThe modernization of the Emmett Till narrative goes beyond the fact that there\u2019s actual footage of Washington\u2019s murder. Imagine Carolyn Bryant filming her husband and brother-in-law mutilate Emmett before shooting him in the head and dumping his body in the Tallahatchie River. Well, welcome to 2021. Cranston\u2019s girlfriend, Allie, filmed her boyfriend shooting Barry Washington Jr. Despite Washington\u2019s advances being nothing less than respectable, she is heard on camera antagonizing him before a final shoving match between he and her boyfriend ended with a gunshot.\nButler delivered the 60-second clip to local publication Central Oregon Daily News. On it, she\u2019s heard re-entering the nightclub after the shooting and telling an unidentified person that the victim laid out on the concrete outside pushed her. Her statement speaks for a dark, deep-seeded national psychosis of White entitlement in response to Black death. It says she immediately felt that Washington\u2019s murder was justified; that a Black man engaging in a shoving match with a White man warrants the extermination of his Black life. That Butler delivered the recording to the news station reveals an insidiously dangerous arrogance. That arrogance coupled with her justification blinded so bright that she provided coldblooded murder evidence with little concern for her complicity. With the numbers being two Whites to one Black, she must\u2019ve felt her innocence, although unreasonable, would never be in doubt.\nAs the footage of Washington\u2019s murder traveled online, outrage sparked across the country. Presumably pressurized, Bend\u2019s (White) district attorney, John Hummel, rearrested Cranston and deployed a grand jury to reconsider his offenses. On October 5, Cranston was brought up on six charges: Second-degree murder, first and second-degree murder, first-degree assault, and two counts of unlawful use of a weapon.\nAfter the new charges were announced, Hummel stood in front of a podium at the press conference and impressively spoke politically incorrect. The DA had zero interest in dancing around that ugly red, white, and blue gorilla. \u201cThere\u2019s a reckoning with race that needs to happen in Central Oregon, and it needs to happen now,\u201d said Hummel. \u201cOur country has a disgraceful history of denigrating, prosecuting, and lynching Black men for talking to White women.\u201d\nHummel faced some backlash for what many criticized as him fanning racial flames. Bend has a 92% White population; those who make up the tiny African-American population speak of the police force with disgust, yet describe the bias practiced by White residents as micro aggressive. \u201cRacism with a smile,\u201d describes Donovan Adderley, whose 14-year-old son, Deshaun, committed suicide in 2017 after being racially bullied at his high school.\nAmerica should learn from Hummel\u2019s actions. In the U.S.A., where there\u2019s race, there\u2019s normally racism. The only way to extinguish racial flames is to first make the fire visible and uncomfortable to all Americans. Ian Cranston didn\u2019t get the pass White men too often receive after killing a minority because there was visual evidence and a White man believed that Black lives matter. Racism is a problem that affects minorities, but not one that can be solved by the afflicted. The only Americans who can effectively extricate the cancer of racism from the fiber of the United States are White people with good hearts and real power. But in this country, that happens to be another small minority.

Then you retreated with this sort of butler\u2019s slide, as if for a moment you forgot your place at the dinner table was on the periphery. In that moment, it appeared you\u2019d also forgotten your first address. You seemed flustered, then verbally cautious. I heard you bite a loaded tongue. Your mouth deployed damage control on a mess it conceived. I\u2019m sorry, but you just aren\u2019t capable of a performance that dramatic. I mean, I loved Top 5, but not because of your acting. I\u2019d prefer to act like I didn\u2019t understand your discipline Sunday night, but I do. I\u2019m aware of the power under that Academy Award stage.

Like, way more than his performance as Ali. Your joke didn\u2019t warrant an assault (Laverne Cox was far more offensive, but he wouldn\u2019t dare strike her). Your joke wasn\u2019t even funny (did you or one of the Academy writers pen that?). We actually thought it was a shot at Jada\u2019s eroded legacy as a film star. Instead you misfired and struck her alopecia along with Will\u2019s threshold. You were accosted by a man whose been publicly emasculated by the woman he claimed to be protecting. All that talk about will power and using discipline as a barometer for whether a person is living their dreams. From speech to soliloquy to book; now look at him. Everyone is a fighter until they get their heart punched through their shoulder blade. In no way has the Fresh Prince regressed to frog status, but today Superman is wearing bifocals again.\nPerhaps, Chris, on the final Sunday of March, you looked like August.\nA Black man who would risk their Top five ranking, especially under the Caucasian gaze, is under the delusion that he has more to gain than lose. Protective and wounded animals are the most dangerous, and Will is a hurt man. His pain stems less from that fact that he\u2019s not an alpha, and more from him being married to one. Jada has never been solely his. She attributed her infidelity to her husband being unaware of it. Imagine a woman revealing that had you just paid attention, you could\u2019ve aborted her entanglements before they bloomed. Imagine August Alsina being the loser with whom your wife embarrassed you. (That\u2019s like your ex-wife bedding Bobby Shmurda while y\u2019all were separated). The forgetful R&B singer who after the Oscars posted on Instagram that life is a series of intricate puzzle pieces being formed and painted by birthing life to your internal masterpiece. That boy is still on hard drugs and quite possibly still funding his dependency with Will\u2019s money. Perhaps, Chris, on the final Sunday of March, you looked like August.\nWesley Morris wrote in the New York Times that when Smith witnessed his wife wince at your joke, he saw his mother. Nine-year-old Will Smith returned and once again saw mom being beat by dad. Still no excuse. In fact, abuse is as present in any American life as cancer. You know this first hand. You wore Will\u2019s shoes decades ago. It\u2019s why you spend every single day fending off the talons of your own trauma. Was being bullied as a child because you were Black worse than being bullied because you were the smallest? I recently learned about the sexual stuff. That day you discovered your own threshold, you slammed a brick into the head of your biggest antagonizer and almost stomped him into an early grave. Did nearly killing a kid scare you straight? Earlier this year, you mentioned that your therapist said you allow people to walk all over you because you\u2019re scared of your own anger. If a psychological fear of fighting back is the reason you uncharacteristically froze on stage Sunday night, I implore you to share that with the world. It\u2019s as necessary for your humanization as it is our collective understanding that you can\u2019t be colored in America and void of trauma.\nI\u2019m not saying you should pay someone to grab a tennis racket and beat the Richard Williams incarnate until its springs uncoil. I wouldn\u2019t even want you to Nancy Kerrigan Will\u2019s shins. Whatever you do, do not listen to Jim Carrey. If you sue Will, whatever new rep you earned as a pussy swells like\u2026well, like Will beat it up. You\u2019re one of the kings of comedy (Cedric the Entertainer is great, but he ain\u2019t you). Your opportunity for vengeance will be granted shortly and on your home court: any stage. It\u2019s now on you to write the fuck out of your legacy\u2019s next chapter. Especially since Tamborine \u2014 although exhibiting your characteristically brilliant and therapeutic way of observing life \u2014 was paltry on the funny. You\u2019re about to embark on a tour with the world\u2019s most lucrative Black comedian. Bank account aside, Kevin Hart is still your son. You have one purpose in life now and that\u2019s to be mightier than ever. Take all the childhood and adult trauma, consider your therapist and daughters, then show the world the inferno that is maturated genius.\nFor the record, we very much appreciate you not elongating your silence on the incident. While your brief statement didn\u2019t answer any questions or provide a glimpse into where your emotions currently live, it was perfect. You promised that once you spoke on the incident it would be wrapped in funny. Your funny is a singular brand that erupts laughter while widening the world. That\u2019s the only thing you owe us right now; it\u2019s all we need.

Atlanta doesn\u2019t just rep for its people or simply do it for the culture; it uses electric blue comedy as a force to shove African-American magic and trauma into the face of its viewers; it illuminates the gold in our colloquialisms and the hilarity in our survival as a lifestyle.\nEvery Atlanta character is a fun house mirror. In them, we see ourselves \u2014 who we think we are as well as a side or two to which we were never before introduced. Earnest (Donald Glover) and Vanessa (Zazie Beetz) plate us the realest form of love \u2014 two complicated young adults unclear on what it is they want outside of the wellbeing of their advanced baby daughter. Paper Boi (Brian Tyree Henry) is the pulse, also serving familiar realness, but from a completely different perch \u2014 sometimes it\u2019s upright; often it is upside down or redefined all together. He reminds us how much we love the hustle, then teaches that dreamers rarely factor the recalibration demanded with every level-up. Darius (LaKeith Stanfield) is just on another level. He\u2019s like a walking peace sign strapped with kush, an occasional pistol and a couple unpublished Milton William Cooper essays. He\u2019s either providing the most sage counsel or eating blunts. Just depends on the day.\nOn March 24, Atlanta returns after a four year hiatus. Not much has been revealed about its third season, but we do know that Paper Boi, Earn and Darius pick up where season 2 concluded. The three have arrived in Europe for the Clark County tour and are undoubtedly with all the shit and shenanigans. But first, lest we forget what makes this FX show so cerebrally singular. Below are the five smartest episodes of Atlanta\u2019s first two seasons.\nVitiligo Donald Glover is visually disturbing \u2014 like Sammy Sosa\u2019s new face and watching a runny ostrich egg get fisted.\nS1 EP 2: STREETS ON LOCK\nPaper Boi and Earn are in jail. The former for squeezing his trigger and the latter for stashing half of a blunt. The shooting skyrockets Paper Boi\u2019s street cred and mixtape single. Now the new hood celeb is getting all the perks (Lemon pepper wet with extra blue cheese) and press (VIBE magazine asked if he\u2019s Atlanta\u2019s new Tupac). Except you can\u2019t accept street love without the hate. Earn is a little too close to love while awaiting bail in the county lock up. The jail scene is really the episode. In a single holding pen, the writers manage to shed stark light on homophobia, sexual shaming, and the penal system\u2019s penchant for throwing the mentally ill behind bars instead of admitting them into psychiatric facilities \u2014 those first two offer comedic rhythm and performances of equal brilliance.\nTHE LINE: \u201cHow would you know that you\u2019re alive unless you knew that you could die?\u201d\nS1 EP 9: JUNETEENTH\nThis episode is season one\u2019s crowning achievement. It begins painfully: Vanessa picks up Earn from the apartment of a one-night stand. Read that again. Earn also feels the pain. He is wake-and-bake high and in route to a White man\u2019s Juneteenth celebration with a now perturbed Vanessa. His annoyance stems from V making him pretend to be her husband in order to impress the affluent and culturally twisted Juneteenth hosts \u2014 one of which is the aforementioned Caucasian man who paints Malcolm X-inspired portraits of the Black man\u2019s plight and pours his African-American guests Hennessy. The party\u2019s bar offered a themed menu with cocktail names like \u201c40 Acres and a Moscow Mule,\u201d \u201cUnderground Rum-road\u201d and \u201cPlantation Master Poison.\u201d Although the script is decorated with decadently offensive dialogue (chef\u2019s kiss for Earn\u2019s exit), the ending is happy.\nTHE LINE: \u201cThis spooky thing called slavery happened and my entire ethnic identity was erased.\u201d\nS2 E6: TEDDY PERKINS\nThe afternoon begins with Darius reimagining a snapback cap that dons a confederate flag and the words \u201cAmerican Made,\u201d and has nothing to do with season 2\u2019s finest ep. Vitiligo Donald Glover is visually disturbing \u2014 like Sammy Sosa\u2019s new face and watching a runny ostrich egg get fisted. Theodore \u201cTeddy\u201d Perkins is also disturbed. His father is an emotionally sore subject. Nonetheless, Perkins is his dad\u2019s staunchest defender. He proudly ranks his pop with the patriarchs of Serena Williams, Marvin Gaye and, of course, Michael Jackson. After all, Teddy\u2019s father physically disciplined his brother Benny into an elite club with pianists like Ahmad Jamal. This may add some insight into the unquenched thirst apparent in Teddy. Could be why he serves water as a punch, and can\u2019t see as far as Stevie Wonder.\nTHE LINE: \u201cNot all great things come from pain. Sometimes, it\u2019s love.\u201d\nS2 EP 8: WOODS\nPaper Boi can\u2019t have it both ways. He\u2019s gained local fame by being his authentic self, yet stubborn to his new reality: He can no longer be who he was. Even his ulterior motivated non-girlfriend tries to open his eyes. Sierra talks too much, but knows what she\u2019s saying. She also has vision and sees that her boo is occupying one of life\u2019s holding patterns. Remaining there is the definition of stagnation. What Paper Boi needs to do is acknowledge the holding pattern and accept it as his cocoon. It still takes \u201ckeeping it real\u201d to go wrong before the rapper decides in which direction to head. He realizes being stagnant isn\u2019t just lazy, it\u2019s deadly. He had the absolute worst day ever. On the bright side, his mother never stopped preaching. Tough love.\nTHE LINE: \u201cYou\u2019re wasting time, and the only people who got time are dead.\u201d\nS2 EP 11: CRABS IN A BARREL\nWhen it comes to season premiers and finales, Atlanta is 4 for 4. So many gems are dropped in the season 2 closer. Earn is stressed and feeling his learning curve is coming to an end. He tries to hire Black, but systemic racism does deep psychological damage. It\u2019s not that Jews are better at their job; the truth is Black business is fragile biz so African-Americans are apprehensive to pit potential success against American oppression. It\u2019s why cousins Earn and Paper Boi can\u2019t both learn (and fail) on the job. Earn and Vanessa learn that it\u2019s not too different with education. The advice dished to Black parents without chaser: Keep your child in a healthy two-parent home or prepare to overpay for private school. The only choice Earn is left with is to protect the fam\u2019s (Black) biz by any means necessary. Can\u2019t say the same for Clark County. Europe should be interesting.\nTHE LINE: \u201cIf I see a steer smart enough to get out of the pen, I leave the gate open.\u201d", "comment_count": 1, "like_count": 343, "created_time": 1647924824472, "comment": [{"user_id": "a84285dcd1d", "comment_time": 1647924824472, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "4f4511c705d1", "comment_time": 1647973202551, "comment": "Can't wait for the new season(s)."}], "post_tag": ["Atlanta", "Donald Glover", "TV Series", "Hip Hop", "Television"]}, {"author": "Bonsu Thompson", "post_id": "e7c5f3f8a2b4", "user_id": "a84285dcd1d", "title": "The World\u2019s Epicenter of Drug Overdoses Pt. 2", "content": "The World\u2019s Epicenter of Drug Overdoses Pt. 2\nAmerica\u2019s death by narcotics epidemic lives mainly where the poorest and darkest people reside\nPhoto by Jakob Owens on Unsplash\nAlthough the United States is the global leader in drug overdose deaths, its national leader is New York City. Inside the Rotten Apple, a person dies every seven hours from narcotic use. Break the city\u2019s death rate down by its five boroughs and you\u2019ll see that the capital of the overdose epidemic is the Bronx.\nNYC\u2019s most northern sector averages about 400 overdose deaths a year. Over the last half decade, it has not only led the other boroughs\u2014by a large margin\u2014in unintentional death by drugs, but has also seen its numbers climb annually. In 2018, the X reported over 100 more deaths than its runner up, Brooklyn. The fact that Brooklyn has a larger population is irrelevant to the math. The same for the reports from city officials that the native drug crisis is on the decline.\nBefore COVID-19\u2019s arrival, NYC\u2019s death by narcotic use rate began to plateau. A closer look revealed that each borough exhibited decrease or steadiness. The Bronx was the only NYC borough with numbers that continued to ascend. Once the pandemic hit, the numbers rose everywhere. Nowhere more prominently than in the Bronx. It took only three quarters of 2020 (two quarters of a pandemic) for the BX to reach its 2019 total for death by unintentional overdose.\nThere\u2019s no coincidence that the world\u2019s epicenter of drug overdose deaths is comprised of New York City\u2019s poorest communities.\nThere\u2019s no coincidence that the world\u2019s epicenter of drug overdose death is comprised of New York City\u2019s poorest communities. 30% of all Bronx residents live below the poverty line. That number rises in the borough\u2019s poorest section: the South Bronx (NYC\u2019s lowest poverty rate is around 6% in affluent communities like the Financial District and Upper East Side). The South Bronx\u2019s poorest residents live in areas like Hunts Point, Belmont and East Tremont\u2014the same sections with the greatest volume of overdose deaths. They\u2019re also three of the city\u2019s top five neighborhoods with the most hospitalizations per 100,000 people. In addition to hospitalizations caused by narcotic abuse, they also lead their borough and city in medical admissions related to psychiatric issues and alcoholism.\nThe South Bronx also owns New York City\u2019s lowest life expectancy rate. Travel only two NYC subway stops south and life increases by at least a decade. The chance of dying by substance or alcohol abuse also lowers. It\u2019s not that the Central Park or Upper East Side community consumes less heroin and whiskey. They have the privilege of a medical community invested in keeping them not necessarily sober, but alive. The latter doesn\u2019t seem to be the case uptown. Medical centers like the South Bronx\u2019s Lincoln Hospital have a horrible history of servicing the poorest people in the poorest communities with the poorest attention and aid. The negligence is not only rooted in the fact that Lincoln is under-resourced by NYC Health + Hospital, the largest municipal healthcare corporation in the United States, but that the hospital brass has expressed historically a disinterest in addressing an epidemic to which no other medical facility is closest.\nThe South Bronx and Lincoln Hospital is worse than a microcosm of the tragedy that is the American healthcare system\u2014it\u2019s the equator. Communities with the greatest volume of peril and illness are prioritized the least. The reason is a simple, yet age old history: the United States has upheld a perennial disparity in available quality healthcare between its haves and have-nots. Residents of Hunts Point, East New York, Brightmoor and South Central possess the least, thus receive the least amount of veteran physicians or substance abuse treatment centers. Those with the most remain the benefactors of America\u2019s benevolence. Add that the poorest and sickest sections are populated primarily by people of color and this crime against humanity becomes par for a course painted red, white and blue.\nAfrican-Americans make up over 40% of the South Bronx demographic. Over 50% is Hispanic. After considering Asians and Indians, whites make up a single digit fraction of the population. Those racial numbers alone explain why this nation has shown zero urgency in providing aid where its worst epidemic lives and death soars.", "comment_count": 3, "like_count": 270, "created_time": 1647506170611, "comment": [{"user_id": "a84285dcd1d", "comment_time": 1647506170611, "comment": ""}, {"user_id": "d2be1f330cae", "comment_time": 1647523521183, "comment": "Can you please cite?
