This unique characteristic of VR apps is called \u201cimmersion\u201d and the feeling it evokes is referred to as \u201cpresence\u201d.\nImmersion is a sense of belief that one has left the real world and is now \u201cpresent\u201d in the virtual environment,\nAs many workflows are moving from physical to virtual, there is a growing need for them to be realistic \u2014 we want people to feel comfortable during virtual team collaboration, almost as if they were talking to their colleagues standing at a physical whiteboard. The same is true for any B2B, B2C, or entertainment VR app \u2014 if it\u2019s boring or awkward, the user will take their headset off.\nFor us as designers, it introduces a new set of usability metrics intended to measure user\u2019s presence \u2014 user\u2019s situation awareness and ability to control, the realism of the virtual environment, the meaningfulness of the experience, absence of disruptions, consistency of multimodal information, etc.\nIn this article, I\u2019d like to form a checklist of design principles that help create engaging experiences and make users want to come back.\n\u2705 Prioritise physiological comfort\nComfort and ease of use are essential for any type of UX. Still, it\u2019s particularly critical when designing for VR, as this type of experience impacts more sides of our brain and will cause immediate rejection as soon as things get uncomfortable for any reason.\nIn other words, comfort is the unsaid expectation if you want to achieve presence.\nElimination of motion sickness\nThe most common reason for motion sickness in VR is called vection \u2014 it occurs when eyes tell us we\u2019re moving while our vestibular system knows we\u2019re perfectly still. To avoid this effect:\nNever turn off head tracking.\nMove linearly, in short bursts.\nKeep the user in control of their movements. Exceptions are special settings, for example, when the viewer is a passenger on a virtual bus. However, even in such cases, allow the user to start the bus ride themselves instead of automatic start.\nDon\u2019t accelerate the camera and maintain a steady frame rate at all times.\nGrounding with fixed objects\nThe need for grounding has been perfectly defined in design guidelines for Google Cardboard:\nYou can ground the user with virtual cockpits, chairs, or other stationary objects to explain why they are sitting \u2014 despite the fact that VR shows them moving. If the user is near a very large virtual object that is moving, they may mistakenly believe that they are moving, as opposed to the large object moving. This may cause discomfort. Avoid this by including more fixed points of reference in the user\u2019s environment.\nGaze based UI\nFor headsets that support gaze-based events, it can be a subtle and effortless way to navigate through the app. In the example below, when a user looks at a constellation, it activates a hover-state gaze cue and reveals navigational options.\n\u201cHover style\u201d gaze cues for exploration and navigation in Gaud\u00ed VR Experience\nUser\u2019s perspective\nPlacing the point of perspective at the height of the user\u2019s eyes creates better presence, as the viewer becomes part of the scene. On the contrary, placing a user\u2019s perspective above the scene feels implausible, as if the viewer was a hovering observer.\nUnnatural point of perspective in Holy City VR\n\u2705 Ensure easy wayfinding\nThe simplest way to direct the user and avoid disorientation is to place visual cues, such as teleport markers, footprints, or strings of objects that guide the user through space and narrative. At the beginning of the game, place the user in front of the most important item of interest.\nVisual navigation clues in Angest VR app\nHowever, as users advance through the scenes, the entire 360\u00b0 field of view isn\u2019t present before their eyes at all times, which means that sometimes they can miss an important object or event. If you can\u2019t reduce the probability of such a situation in a visual way, use sounds to attract the user\u2019s attention to it.\nIf motion controllers are being utilised, combine sensory stimuli by vibrating one of the controllers in combination with visual or audio cues.\nSometimes the place itself becomes a hint. According to the behaviour settings theory, people tend to follow stereotypical behaviour patterns once they find themselves within a specific setting. For example, if you place a viewer inside a virtual supermarket, most probably, they will intuitively start their experience by grabbing a cart.\nIf you want to understand the assumptions people have about a certain type of place, it\u2019s best to visit a similar place in the physical world \u2014 deconstruct how you\u2019re feeling within that space, and which elements are implying that you have to behave in a certain way.\n\u2705 Provide environmental richness\nSpatial storytelling techniques\nIn VR, just like in computer games, space is the story. Rich VR environments provoke users to fill in plot details on their own, even without any verbal narratives or any characters present in the scene.\nDisneyland theme parks are a great source of inspiration for this kind of narrative called spatial storytelling. At Disney, \u201carchitects may strive for historic authenticity and recreate historic buildings, take a whimsical approach and exaggerate storybook images\u201d, use visual tricks such as \u201cforced perspective\u201d \u2014 all to make spark viewer\u2019s imagination and stimulate fantasy. These concepts of entertainment architecture can be perfectly applied to virtual experiences, too.\nAnother great example is a game called Monument Valley, the 1st part of which was more setting-based than plot-based, engaging the user with a series of M.C. Escher-like architectural puzzles.\n\nMeaningfulness of experience\nIn the first 30 seconds of the experience, when the user is deciding whether to take their headset off or stay, it is important to spark their curiosity and capture their attention. To achieve that, make sure there are animated (preferably in a subtle way) cues in your environment from the very first scene of your app. This trick is based on a scientific fact that humans are more attracted to moving objects than still objects in the scene.\nAnimated objects guiding the user in Wonderglade VR\nRich content and elements of discovery\nUsers quickly lose interest in the app once they\u2019ve explored every corner of it. At the same time, not always you have a budget to build a 3D world as entertaining as a theme park. The good news is that storytelling in VR doesn\u2019t have to be setting-focused only. A great example is the products that tap into a database of community-generated content, where the possibilities for discovery are endless; for instance, Google Earth VR or Wander.\nPlaces exploration in Wander VR\nUsing data from Google StreetView, this app allows one to point at the map and teleport to a place they\u2019ve never seen before or couldn\u2019t even imagine.\n\u2705 Help users feel in control\nPersonal space\nThe rise of social VR accelerates discussions around the topic of personal space and safety in virtual reality. According to Robert Sommer, personal space is \u201can area with invisible boundaries surrounding a person\u2019s body into which intruders may not come.\u201d\nVirtual objects and avatars can freely bump into each other, not bound by the limitations of the cultural etiquette we follow in the real world. This may feel uncomfortable for many people actively participating in social VR events. Altspace VR has solved the problem by introducing a \u201cspace bubble\u201d tool. The space bubble creates a close barrier around your avatar to prevent others from entering your personal space.\nSpace bubble tool in Altspace VR\nPhysical environmental modifiability\nAs defined by Thomas B. Sheridan, \u201cpresence should increase as one\u2019s ability to modify physical objects in that environment increases\u201d. This may be partially explained by the phenomenon of territoriality:\nTerritoriality leads us to mark, or personalise, our territory, to signify our \u201cownership\u201d\nTo meet this need, allow users to adjust the surroundings in a way that\u2019s comfortable to them, or at least make them feel they\u2019re in control of the space. As a minimum, a user expects that they will be able to open doors in a VR environment. Next levels of modifiability could include the ability to re-arrange objects in a room, write on a virtual whiteboard, or construct the entire virtual space to their liking.\nImmersion and presence in VR is a vast topic, and this article is only scratching the surface.

I never thought I\u2019d be writing about politics, but my country has been at war for 13 days now.\nI want the world to know the truth.\nI\u2019m scared to go to sleep. In the morning, I\u2019m scared to open my eyes \u2014 what if I read about bombardments of my home city? My hands shake when I\u2019m opening a messenger to check if my parents are online. To check if my parents are alive. I\u2019d never been religious, but now I pray.\nRussian fascists have been shelling Ukrainian cities for two weeks now. Russian airplanes have been dropping bombs on residential areas. Russian soldiers have been killing civilians, including women and children. Nuclear power plants have been captured and used as a nuclear threat. At the moment of writing this, 742,000 civilians are cut off from electricity, 238,000 are cut off from gas. A humanitarian catastrophe is at full scale, and Russians have cynically mined the \u201csafe passage\u201d they promised to keep.\nDamaged buildings in a residential area of Bila Tserkva on March 5, 2022. (Wojciech Grzedzinski/for The Washington Post)\nStill, despite all these horrors and war crimes, I see a crippling trend on social media: lots of people are unsupportive of Ukraine and even defending Russia.\nSome of these people like to consider themselves \u201calternative thinkers\u201d, who are unbiased and wary of Western propaganda (and I suspect a lot of them are the same people who didn\u2019t believe in Covid), so they avoid sharing any information about the Russian war in Ukraine.\nSome of them like to consider themselves pacifists and socialists, so they don\u2019t want to donate to the Ukrainian army.\nSome are just ordinary people enjoying their comfortable lives in Europe, the USA, and all over the world \u2014 and wondering why news and media are full of gory images these days, and why should they care? Why should they sign any petitions or finance a conflict they don\u2019t fully understand?\nUkraine needs your support. Ukraine needs you to know that truth. If you are still in doubt about what\u2019s going on in Ukraine now (or know any people who are)\u2014 I\u2019ve attempted to list and debunk the most horrifying myths about the Russian invasion. I\u2019m also sharing information on what you can do instead of supporting these myths.\nMyth # 1\nEconomic sanctions against Russia won\u2019t stop the war. Millions of ordinary Russian people will lose their jobs.\nFalse. There is a method to end any dictatorship, and economic sanctions are part of this method. If no companies are left on the Russian market, where will the dictator get his money from? Every company that hasn\u2019t canceled Russia yet is basically sponsoring this terror full time. The same goes for the oil embargo \u2014 oil is the only way Russia can earn money to continue funding its war crimes. If all countries agree to stop buying oil from Russia, the war will cease soon.\nAs for ordinary people, sanctions are the only way to force them to protest (see Myth # 2). Another effect is that Russians are losing their jobs fleeing the country \u2014 as a result, fewer taxes and fewer men available for Putin to send them to war (remember, Ukrainians are dying, and it\u2019s worse than losing a job). Also, sanctions will cause social turmoil, which will inevitably weaken Russia\u2019s military power.\nPeople demonstrate in support of Ukraine outside the residence of UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson in London on February 25. Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images\nWhat YOU can do: if you\u2019re worried about people losing jobs, support Ukrainians who lost their jobs because of the Russian invasion.\nHere is a couple of websites where you can hire Ukrainian professionals:\n\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\udcbb Hire for Ukraine\n\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\udcbb UA Talents\n\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\udcbb Hire a Ukrainian Refugee\n\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\udcbb Job4Ukraine\nMyth # 2\nRussian people can\u2019t do anything. Protests don\u2019t work in an authoritarian state.\nFalse. Protests are effective. Authoritarian states just require more significant protests \u2014 mass strikes of the regime\u2019s core electorate. So far, only a few thousand have taken it to the streets in Russia, a country with a 145-million population. Obviously, these are the most educated and intellectual people of the country who\u2019d never supported the Putin regime. These people are a minority. We need to trigger protests of the masses, protests of millions who would simply overwhelm the police force (the bigger part of Russian police are currently distracted by killing people in Ukraine).\nIn fact, similar protests took place in Russia in 2018 \u2014 the so-called \u201cgarbage protests\u201d against Moscow garbage being landfilled in northern Russia. About 16,000 people turned up in the 30 places, despite the risk of arrests. After two years of activism, they reverted the authorities\u2019 decision.\nSo Russians ARE able to protest? And they can be successful at it, when they are really motivated. Current unprecedented economic sanctions will be their next \u201cmotivation\u201d.\nAnother great example of an effective protest is the Ukrainian Revolution of Dignity, the Maidan Revolution of 2013\u20132014. Millions of Ukrainians went to protests, managed to defend their country\u2019s democracy and prevented a slide back into Kremlin-style authoritarianism. \nIf millions of Russians took it to the streets, they would simply overwhelm the police force (the bigger part of Russian police are currently distracted by killing people in Ukraine).\n\nMore examples of effective and heroic protests from recent days:\nUkrainians trying to stop Russian tanks with their bare hands in Eastern Ukraine\nsocial protests in the cities seized by Russian forces, where thousands of people remain protesting in the central squares despite the danger of being shot by the occupants\npeople creating a living shield with their bodies to protect the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant in Enerhodar.\nCitizens create a roadblock on a road that leads to the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant, in Enerhodar, Ukraine, March 2, 2022.Facebook/National Guard of Ukraine\nWhat YOU can do: support Ukraine and the world in imposing EVEN MORE economic sanctions on Russia and Russian citizens. One of the ways to intensify this pressure is to write messages and emails to your local members of parliament and senators, with direct demands to block all business with Russia.\nFor example, here is the list of US Congress senators you can write to.\nAnother way is to put pressure on international brands who are still continuing business with Russia. At the moment of writing this, Coca-Cola and Pepsi are still operating in Russia, and at least 35 top brands still remain on the Russian market \u2014 here is the full list.\n\nPosters demonstrating how profits from sales of Faberlic and Greenfield products can be used to sponsor the war in Ukraine\nMyth # 3\nRussians and Ukrainians are both victims in this situation.\nFalse. Imagine you\u2019re walking home at night and see someone raping a woman. Without saying a word or calling the police, you carry on walking home. Does it make you a victim in this situation? No, it makes you an accomplice. This is exactly what Russians are doing (and have been doing during the entire duration of the Putin regime). They observe their government raping and murdering Ukraine.\nAccording to numerous recent reports (and from my personal experience), many Russians simply refuse to acknowledge the atrocities that have accompanied Putin\u2019s invasion. You\u2018ll be shocked to learn how many Russians are, in fact, endorsing the war effort and are vocal about it. For example, heads of 250 Russian universities published an official address by the Union of Russian Rectors on March 4 justifying the war and calling on Russians to rally in support of Putin.\nYou have to understand that the majority of Russians have imperial mindset and had been supporting the annexation of Crimea before and after 2014 (claiming it to be the \u201cnative Russian land\u201d). Even the most liberal Russians, even leaders of the Russian opposition, such as Alexey Navalny, do not see any problem in the annexation of Crimea \u2014 which means they\u2019re violating the sovereignty of Ukraine as an independent state. Navalny also supported Russian war in Georgia in 2008. You can\u2019t be a victim and an aggressor at the same time.\nTo validate this, do a simple test \u2014 ask any liberal Russian who\u2019d fled their country recently \u2014 which country does Crimea belong to? The answer will surprise you. Russians still crave to be the supreme nation and expand their territories.\nWhat YOU can do: spread the truth about Russians, about Putin and his regime. Share information about this war, killed and tortured civilians, and ruined cities on social media with the hashtags #StandWithUkraine, #RussiaInvadedUkraine, #PutinIsATerrorist, #StopPutin, #StopWar, #UkraineWillResist, #HelpUkraineNow, #StopRussianAggression.\nMyth # 4\nYou should feel sorry for the Russians who are suffering now.\nFalse. It\u2019s Ukrainians who are dying now, not Russians. Every minute you spend discussing how Russians lost access to their favourite Netflix movies, lost their jobs, or lost their freedom for 15 days due to their participation in protests \u2014 just remember: Ukrainians are dying.\nA 6-year-old child died of dehydration in Mariupol yesterday because Russian fascists had been blocking water supplies. By shifting priorities to Russians\u2019 needs, you\u2019re allowing more Ukrainian children to die.\n\n\nPeople struggling to escape the Russian massacre in several cities of Ukraine \u00a9 Independent.co.uk\nWhat YOU can do: Post tweets on the pages of all major human rights organisations, such as @UNHumanRights. Attract their attention to the humanitarian catastrophe in Ukraine. Write direct messages to their leaders on Linkedin and on Twitter. Put pressure on @RedCross and @BritishRedCross, as they\u2019re currently not doing enough to ensure the safe passage from Mariupol and other Ukrainian cities terrorised by Russian fascists.\nMyth # 5\n\u201cI\u2019m not supporting NATO and I don\u2019t want to finance another war. I\u2019m a pacifist and I wish peace for everyone. Violence is not the answer.\u201d\nImagine a bully attacking you in the street. What will you do? Cry for peace and show them a picture of a pigeon? Or fight back? Ukrainians are fighting back, and they\u2019re fighting for peace of entire Europe. Putin is a bully, and he won\u2019t stop at Ukraine. If you want peace, you need victory first. Wish us victory, send us weapons, send us funds to fight back.\nWhat YOU can do: there are many ways to support the humanitarian mission in Ukraine.\n\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6 \ud83c\udfe6 The easiest way to donate is through this website, built in partnership with several Ukrainian fundraisers: https://www.withukraine.org/en\n\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6 \ud83c\udfe6 Fundraiser organised by the Ukrainian Tech community (they focus on medium-sized orders of supplies that often go overlooked by large foundations): https://koloua.com/en/\nA man protesting in London, UK. His banner says \u201cSend weapons, not prayers\u201d\nMyth # 6\n\u201cUkrainian government doesn\u2019t want to negotiate. Ukrainian president could end this conflict peacefully.\u201d\nFalse. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky had offered Putin to meet and talk long before the war started. Ukrainian representatives participated in all rounds of current Ukrainian-Russian \u201cnegotiations\u201d, and every time the demands of Russia were unacceptable for the sovereignty of Ukraine. The demands include Ukraine ceasing military action, changing its constitution to enshrine neutrality, acknowledging Crimea as Russian territory, and recognising the separatist republics of Donetsk and Lugansk as independent states. Such demands are a political joke and by no means Ukraine will accept them.\nOther world leaders tried to negotiate with Putin, too, but all their efforts were futile, as in the case of Emmanuel Macron.\nWhat YOU can do: If you want this war to end peacefully, sign a petition for NATO to close Ukrainian sky: openpetition.eu/!stopwar. This plea includes a lot of possible measures (their effectiveness is explained and measured in this article), all of which will help Ukraine immensely. Petitions and social activism have been very successful so far \u2014 governments are taking unprecedented actions to bankrupt Russian war machine, partially thanks to people like you and me, who are expressing our demands on social media and at peaceful rallies.\nA woman carried by Ukrainian soldiers crosses an improvised path while fleeing the town of Irpin, Ukraine, Sunday, March 6, 2022.

(Oleksandr Ratushniak/AP)\nMyth # 7\n\u201cWe also need to stand for the Russian culture and arts, as they are being cancelled now.\u201d\nFalse. Russian culture isn\u2019t your first priority now.

Public domain\nWhy are some artworks easily forgotten, while others make you want to revisit them again and again? Some paintings ignite creativity in other people and even inspire them to create masterpieces of their own. The secret is that people like vivid artworks with a mystery about them. By solving the mystery, they become part of the painting\u2019s storytelling. And a careful study of the painting visual details makes one remember it for years. That\u2019s why many are fascinated with the masterpieces of the past \u2014 they are so realistic and magical at the same time.\nIn this story, I\u2019m going to speak about some of the most intriguing artworks of the Tate collection that have become iconic for entire generations of creative minds. We\u2019ll see what makes them such a mystery and a hot topic in the art world.\nThe Fairy Feller\u2019s Master-Stroke (1855\u201364)\nTate is the most famous family art galleries in the UK. In London, there are two of them: Tate Modern on the south bank of the Thames, the top destination for contemporary art in London, and Tate Britain, its more introverted and moody sister. In both of them, you can get lost for hours, wandering and discovering gems of British and international art.\nIn the Victorian room of Tate Britain, you can see a small and very detailed painting that has been an inspiration to people like Freddie Mercury, Terry Pratchett, and Neil Geiman. It is called The Fairy Feller\u2019s Master-Stroke.\nAs you approach the picture, you can\u2019t help but stare through the grass blades, observing a party of disturbingly looking creatures, painted at many different scales.\nIn the centre the \u2018fairy-feller\u2019 is about to split a large chestnut, to be used to build a new carriage for Queen Mab, a fairy mentioned in William Shakespeare\u2019s play Romeo and Juliet.\nAbove the feller there is a large figure called the Patriarch \u2014 he\u2019s got a huge hat with fairies and elves dancing on its brim. Another distinct character is the little old man with a white beard, looking at the scene with terror in his eyes. The more you look, the more faces you discover \u2014 hard-faced, distorted men and ballerinas \u2014 but the less you understand this mysterious artwork\u2019s meaning.\n\n\nThe Fairy Feller\u2019s Master-Stroke by Richard Dadd \u00a9 Tate\nThe picture was painted by Richard Dadd (1817\u20131886). In art history, he\u2019s known as the founding member of The Clique, one of the first English artist groups and opponents of the Pre-Raphaelites. In 1842 Richard Dadd went to Egypt. While travelling up the Nile by boat, he underwent a dramatic personality change \u2014 suddenly, he decided he was an incarnation of the Egyptian god Osiris.\nSince then, Dadd started being violent and delusional, which ended tragically\u2014 one day he became convinced his father was the Devil in disguise and stabbed him. After attempting an escape to France and trying to kill another person en route, Dadd was committed to the Bethlem psychiatric hospital, where he created some of his most famous works, including The Fairy Feller\u2019s Master-Stroke. Dadd spent nine years painting the picture and still gave it up slightly unfinished, leaving room for various interpretations.\nIn 1974 Freddie Mercury wrote a song that took its title from the painting, using lyrics from the poem Richard Dadd had written to accompany the artwork. The song was performed by the rock group Queen:\n\nThe Cholmondeley Ladies (c.1600\u201310)\nIn the Elizabethan room of Tate Britain, where some of the British oldest artworks are hanging, there is a magnetic painting that you can spot as soon as you enter the room. Two ladies sit in identical poses, side by side, each holding a baby. They\u2019re dressed in gorgeous clothing decorated with lace and jewelry, and each detail of the picture makes you want to explore it for hours. Your first thought is that the ladies are twins, but you notice the different eye colours \u2014 one blue and one brown. Their babies also seem identical, but they\u2019re not. The painter\u2019s identity remains a mystery.\nThe Cholmondeley sisters and their swaddled babies. c.1600\u20131610. Public domain\nWhen I first saw the picture, I was hypnotised: the contrast of the rich red and the silver-white, ladies\u2019 eyes almost piercing the flatness of the picture, and most strikingly \u2014 the symmetry. The inscription in gold lettering says: \u201cTwo Ladies of the Cholmondeley Family, Who were born the same day, Married the same day, And brought to Bed the same day\u201d \u2014 even their lives were strangely symmetrical.\nThere are always a lot of viewers around the picture \u2014 people are naturally curious about everything looking like twins or doubles. Twins were even associated with magic or evil in medieval times, and it\u2019s still a recurring theme in horror movies and music videos. But Cholmondeley Ladies, despite their unsmiling fixed stare, look oddly beautiful, rather than scary.\nThe painting looks very English \u2014 the work is thought to have been painted near the Cholmondeley family\u2019s estates in Cheshire. It reminds me of another mysterious artist Lewis Carrol, with his Cheshire Cat and his joyful Tweedledum and Tweedledee twins. And this is what makes Cholmondeley Ladies so fascinating \u2014 all these layers of associations and subconscious impressions make you feel as if you\u2019re immersing in a long story rather than looking at a single painting.\nA Bigger Splash (1967)\nDavid Hockney is one of the most popular artists nowadays. He\u2019s one of my favourite painters, too, as his work is both very joyful and strange. Being a great experimenter and educator of the art world, Hockney has been using iPad to create hundreds of paintings since 2009. Luckily he\u2019s British, too, so Tate owns some of his work.\nA Bigger Splash is David Hockney\u2019s best known masterpiece, which he had made after visiting and falling in love with California. The painting stirs the imagination: there\u2019s nobody in sight, and the scene is almost perfectly still \u2014 apart from the splash. The palms, the heat, and the sunlit house make the situation look so inviting, and yet something is haunting about it as if there is a secret a viewer has to solve.\nA Bigger Splash by David Hockney \u00a9 Tate\nDavid Hockney used some special techniques to contrast the dynamic splash and the dead still surroundings. First of all, he painted the blocks of colour with a paint-roller, applying two-three layers of acrylic until it was opaque. He then was painting the splash for two weeks, accurately reproducing it from a photograph with small brush strokes. A wide border around the picture is left uncovered by paint, which makes it resemble a polaroid photo.\nThough inspired by photos, Hockney only uses them as an additional tool to remember information. Otherwise, he thinks a photograph \u201cisn\u2019t real enough\u201d.\n\u201cEverything on a flat surface is stylized, including the photograph. Some people think the photograph is reality; they don\u2019t realize that it\u2019s just another form of depiction.\u201d\nAnother inspiration for Hockney was his trip to Egypt and the composition of Egyptian tomb paintings, where figures and objects are carefully arranged on the flat surface. Many of his later portraits seemed to be influenced by it, as well as by Renaissance art.\nDavid Hockney\u2019s shares a lot of secrets of visual expression and art techniques in his book A History Of Pictures: From The Cave To The Computer Screen, written together with Martin Gayford, a famous art critic.\nIf you liked this article, feel free to get in touch on Twitter.

While doing customer discovery for our clients as part of the company\u2019s cross-functional Product Design service, I\u2019ve learned that it\u2019s important to set up a robust approach to customer insights management from the very beginning, to avoid re-work and wrong product decisions.\nIn this article, I\u2019d like to share best practices and tools that will help you collect customer insights in an unbiased way, easily share and discuss them with your team, and transform them into actions. I\u2019ve also included a Notion template which you can customise into your own database of customer insights \u2014 with tags and views, so you can immediately find what you need, sort the data, and retrieve it at any stage of the product development process.\nPlanning customer discovery\nDepending on the project\u2019s level of uncertainty and complexity, the customer discovery phase can take up to several months and may need to be extended in case of any controversial findings. Every case is unique, but for an early-stage startup a 2-month discovery plan could look like this:\nStart with desk research, personas modeling, and assumptions\nTalk to advisors and subject matter experts\nRecruit participants and schedule interviews 1\u20133 weeks ahead\nPrepare the interactive prototype\nPrepare the research goals and interview guides\nConduct interviews\nTranscribe interviews, extract insights, look for themes\nPrioritise findings\nMake improvements to the product vision, UX, or feature list\nExample of a customer discovery timeline with 20 interviews planned\nPrecise planning is the key if you want to avoid re-work and validate a lot of things before going into the development phase.\nStating your assumptions\nBefore starting the discovery phase, you need to list everything you already know and want to validate with customer interviews. You can use one of the idea validation frameworks, such as Opportunity Canvas, to list all your assumptions about the market, the business model, and your customers\u2019 needs.\nPersonas modeling is also essential at this stage as you\u2019ll be building your interview participant screener based on your personas and gaps in your knowledge about them. Start the discovery phase by conducting a Persona Workshop with your product team and stakeholders.\nExample of a persona in Miro\nFor complex domains and B2B products, it is best to talk to the subject matter experts first\u2014 they\u2019ll fill you in about the needs of your market and the taxonomy of the industry. This will save you a lot of time and costs, otherwise spent on figuring it all out during the interviews, or even worse \u2014 interviewing the wrong types of customers.\nBesides, you\u2019ll be prepared to speak the customer language \u2014 this will help you build rapport quicker and uncover deep motivations, rather than barely scratching the surface of a vast topic.\nIn longer terms, the same effect can be achieved via doing very thorough desk research on the subject \u2014 use a database like ResearchGate to learn what\u2019s already known in your field.\nRecruiting participants\nIf you don\u2019t have your own research participants, you might need to use one of the user recruitment services available on the market, such as UserInterviews, Respondent, or Ethnio. For hard-to-reach audiences, it\u2019s best to request participants from a specialised user research panel. I can recommend Borderless Access, as they ensure the quality of participants and take care of the screening process and interview scheduling.\nWhen recruiting through a third-party agency, you\u2019ll need to provide them with the screening criteria, which you can build with a simple Google form. The screener will also help you to obtain some basic information about your participants beforehand, so you can prepare better before the interview.\nExample of a participant screener in Google forms\nPreparing for interviews\nOnce you\u2019ve recruited the participants and scheduled the interviews, you can start preparing interview guides and research goals.\nResearch goals\nYour research goals are the assumptions you\u2019d like to validate and the most important things you\u2019d like to learn from the participants. If you have multiple personas, prepare research goals for each of them. For example, you may formulate goals like these:\n\u201cTo understand customer\u2019s motivation to use\u2026\u201d\n\u201cTo learn how customers do\u2026\u201d\n\u201cTo get acquainted with the language customers use to describe\u2026\u201d\nInterview guide\nThe topic of preparation for an interview deserves a dedicated article (I really recommend Rob Fitzpatrick\u2019s \u201cThe Mom Test\u201d, an awesome book about customer interviews), but here I\u2019d like to mention the main principles:\nPrepare open-ended questions so you\u2019ll be doing little talking and a lot of listening.\nAvoid priming questions, such as \u201cWhat is more important for you, scheduling your day or answering emails?\u201d.\nAvoid hypotheticals that stimulate the customer to use their imagination rather than recall the facts.\nThe script also depends on the interview format you\u2019ve decided to follow. The most common types are structured, semi-structured, and unstructured interviews. Choose the format based on how much you already know about the subject in general:\nTypes of interviews based on the level of certainty\nIf you\u2019re only beginning to learn what\u2019s important for your customers, the best way to reveal a lot of insights is to use an unstructured interview, which has no predetermined script to it. However, this type is the most difficult one to conduct, as you\u2019ll have to come up with non-priming questions on the go.\nThat\u2019s why most researchers recommend a semi-structured format for the discovery phase. You\u2018ll only need to prepare an \u201cinterview guide\u201d rather than a rigid script for this one. The semi-structured interview allows you to stay within your research goals boundaries and improvise with a lot of probing questions to uncover deep customer insights. It can also be combined with a user testing of an early prototype, so you can build your discussion around the product interface.\nDuring the interview\nTechnical aspects\nIt\u2019s extremely helpful to record the interviews for further analysis, and this is something you need to notify the recruiting agency of. As most interviews are now conducted remotely, we all have the benefit of recording the sessions with video conferencing software. This removes the risk of losing important details and the necessity of inviting a note-taker to each live session.\nFor the sessions to run smoothly, take care of the technical details in advance:\nTell the users not to call in from their mobile phones if a prototype is shared.\nGet prepared for the fact that participants wouldn\u2019t know how to share their screen. Make a few screenshots for them to explain the conferencing software they\u2019ll be using.\nWhen combining a user interview with testing of an interactive prototype, prepare to explain the prototype\u2019s limitations to the participants and to your team. Prepare a back-up scenario if a user can\u2019t open the prototype or the network connection wouldn\u2019t allow them to.\nWarm-up, then get more specific\nAt the beginning of the interview, allow time for the participant to get focused by starting with more general questions. Leave specific and personal questions for the second part of the interview, when you\u2019ve built rapport and dived deep into the topic.\nGuide the discussion\nA participant may start digressing away from the topic in a semi-structured interview. Sometimes this digression is just small talk and isn\u2019t related to your research goals \u2014 keep it up for a minute to build rapport, then softly pivot back on the topic you need to discuss.\nHowever, if the digressing topic keeps re-emerging, it\u2019s a clue to a deep customer's motivation or a need that you didn\u2019t think to ask about. Pay attention if the participant\u2019s getting emotional when they\u2019re talking about it.\nTranscribing the data\nWhen it comes to transcribing, I can recommend two products: Otter and Descript. Descript\u2019s pricing policy is a bit more flexible, so I\u2019ve decided to stick to it. Both products are AI-powered transcription services, which means the quality is not quite as accurate as a human-created transcript. However, if you\u2019re transcribing the interviews you\u2019ve conducted yourself, you won\u2019t have a hard time interpreting the inaccurate parts.\nStill, if you need a human-created transcript, there are several options in the market now, such as Rev and Reduct.\nAnalysis of the interviews\nWhen you have transcribed the interviews, the next step is to analyse the data you\u2019ve collected. Even if you\u2019re pretty sure you\u2019ve already grasped the essence of the interviews, it\u2019s worth doing a proper analysis, for two main reasons:\nThe interview situation is very intense, and it\u2019s easy to overlook things that don\u2019t fit with your preconceived assumptions.\nYour team and stakeholders will understand how you reached various conclusions, and your product decisions will be justified.\nExtract insights\nStart the analysis by reading through the transcripts and colour-coding fragments that are related to your research goals. The aim here is to reduce the amount of raw data and highlight only the most important insights. If you\u2019re at an exploratory stage and don\u2019t have a clear idea of what patterns you are searching for, pay attention to what was important for the participant. It could be something they were particularly enthusiastic about. To remind yourself of these nuances, it\u2019s helpful to re-watch some of the interviews and observe the emotions.\nAfter you\u2019ve colour-coded the transcripts, extract the highlights into an insights database. I use Notion for insights management as it allows creating relations between data fragments and enables grouping of insights by participant or priority.\n\ud83d\udd17 Get Notion template for the insights database here\nAn example of an insights database in Notion\nThematic analysis\nAfter extracting the most important data fragments, look for themes within this data. If time allows, it is best to analyse customer interviews with the entire product team, in an affinity mapping exercise format. Write each insight on a post-it note, cluster related notes into groups, and provide names for these groups \u2014 these will be your themes.\nAffinity mapping in Miro\nThe advantage of doing the affinity mapping on a digital whiteboard, such as Miro or Mural, is that it enables seeing the bigger picture in a live, collaborative format. However, if you have large amounts of data to analyse and retrieve at a later stage, it\u2019s better to use a text-based tool, such as Notion. This will allow you to search the data, easily export it, or link it with project management tools like Jira or Trello.\nLinking insights to themes\nTo do thematic analysis in Notion, create a separate page within your Notion document and call it Themes. As you\u2019re analysing insights and noticing patterns within them, keep adding those as new items on the Themes page. Then add a Relation property (included in the template) to your Insights board, and search for a theme to link each insight to.\nThematic analysis in Notion\nKeep moving back and forth between the Insights database and Themes page, as you\u2019ll be linking the insights to the patterns. Once you\u2019ve finished, switch to the default view in Themes page to see which of them were the most discussed ones and need to be actioned first.\nTransforming insights into action\nNow that you\u2019ve parsed the customer feedback into insights and themes, what\u2019s next? There are several ways in which you can use customer insights to make informed product decisions.\nContinue the discovery or change the strategy\nAt the earliest stages of product development, analysis of customer insights may lead you to unexpected results and a change to your core strategy. Sometimes you may need to continue the interviews, but with a different group of people. This can happen if one of your assumptions proved to be wrong. A common example is that you\u2019ve overestimated the interest of your potential customers in your product. Rob Fitzpatrick in his brilliant book called \u201cThe Mom Test\u201d has provided a great way to understand whether the need is critical for the person or not:\n\u201cAsk your customers what they have tried to solve their problem. If they didn\u2019t care to look for ways of solving it already, they\u2019re not going to look for (or buy) yours.\u201d\nSo it may turn out that you ask a customer how they\u2019re solving a problem now, and their response is \u201cWhat problem?\u201d. It doesn\u2019t automatically mean there is no market for your product. Quite possibly, this customer has a \u201clatent need\u201d in your product and may become your late adopter. A good example is a product for which the end-users are patients, but only doctors can prescribe it. Interviews with the patients may show that they are completely unaware of the fact they even need this product. But interviews with the doctors may contain strong evidence that those have a desperate need for your solution. Hence your first customers, or early adopters, need to be doctors, and they are the ones you need to interview in more detail.\nIn his book \u201cFour Steps to Epiphany\u201d Steve Blank calls such customers \u201cearlyvangelists\u201d and describes the characteristics they need to have:\nCharacteristics of an earlyvangelist from \u201cFour Steps to Epiphany\u201d by Steve Blank\nIf none of the customer insights contained any signs of these characteristics in the people you interviewed, it may be a signal that you need to continue the discovery.\nImprove the product UX\nCustomer interviews give you precious information about how your product experience can be improved. It\u2019s tempting to rush into changing your prototypes immediately after the interview, but wait until you finish the entire round of interviews \u2014 this will make sure all the participants are presented with the same version of the prototype for objectivity. Besides, it will also save you double-work if a contradicting opinion emerges in one of the later interviews.\nFor all the usability issues and UX ideas resulting from interview analysis, create a dedicated tag and a separate page containing the list of proposed UX improvements. This list can be later shared with the team or linked to your other documentation.\nRe-prioritise the features list\nBy creating a relation between the customer insights and your features list, you can see which features were most discussed (criticised or praised). This information can be then used to conduct a Prioritisation Workshop and decide on the scope of your MVP or the next version of your product. You can link customer insights to your features by importing a functionality spreadsheet into a separate page of your Notion document and adding another Relation property in your Insights database.\nIf you enjoyed this article, feel free to download the Notion template for the Customer discovery document and customise it for your own purposes.

My bandwidth is broken.\nMy retail career lasted over twenty years. Every holiday I said it should be my last. It was so hard. I was perpetually exhausted. When I would see a text pop through from my family, I couldn\u2019t even respond until my day off.\nReplying to a text felt like another chore, a monumental task.\nI was off the grid and out of touch. I had been sucked into this retail black hole, and I would only emerge when the season ended.\nAfter two decades, I quit.\nYou think you may want to quit your job.

You know the routine, and your paycheck is decent. You understand how to solve problems, and that\u2019s half the work.\nI get it. I\u2019ve been there.\nI mused about another line of work \u2014 mail carrier maybe. I could drive around, listen to music, and deliver mail. I would have holidays off. Teaching could be fun. Having summers off sounded delightful, but my mom, a former teacher, warned me about school district politics and stick-in-the-mud superintendents.\nAlas, I plugged away in retail.\nI was good at it; really good at it. It\u2019s gratifying to do your job well. It\u2019s fulfilling to be a resource for others. I loved the people that worked in my building. I ran my last store for nine years, so everyone was there because of me. That was a gut-wrenching thing to leave.\nHere\u2019s how I knew it was time.\nMy hobby began to cut into my career\nI started writing online two years ago, and I started slow. I wrote sporadically. I didn\u2019t know what I was trying to achieve; I just enjoyed the process. As I learned more and took on more content creation, it became all I wanted to do.\nI would get up early to write and then scramble to get out the door on time to make it to work because I didn\u2019t want to stop writing.\nWhile at work, I couldn\u2019t help check my messages and see if my article had been accepted or someone had sent me revision notes. I began to become consumed by the craft and the process.\nI was bored\nTwenty years is a long time to do anything. After nine years in one building, I was extremely bored. I could\u2019ve done that job in my sleep.\nMy bosses gave me some stretch assignments, which helped a little. Basically, I got more work for the same salary. This distracted me for a little bit, and then the pandemic hit.\nFor the past two years, my sole focus has been keeping my team safe and informed. Once everyone got used to the crisis and learned how to survive, I couldn\u2019t go back to Monday Zoom calls, schedule writing, and absurd company practices. Especially now that all I really wanted to do was write.\nI was financially set up to take a risk\nMy husband works full-time, and I get medical coverage through him. We don\u2019t have kids and have saved some money because we haven\u2019t done much in two years.\nWe\u2019ve owned our home for fifteen years, so the mortgage isn\u2019t going up. One car is paid off because it\u2019s ten years old. I need to care for my favorite canine, clean my tiny house, and that\u2019s about it.\nMy husband cooks at home every night. We don\u2019t spend money on extravagant things, so I could quit and take a couple of months to write and continue to make connections.\nThinking logistically about your financial situation isn\u2019t exciting. It\u2019s way more fun to exclaim, \u201cI quit!\u201d but it\u2019s necessary.\nTakeaway\nYou know when you\u2019re on a road trip, and you take a freeway exchange that loops you over, under, and around the freeway you were on, then takes you in the direction you want to go? It\u2019s like that.\nLeaving my career felt like a long and winding off-ramp.\nGrateful, lucky, humbled \u2014 I don\u2019t know how to describe the feeling when the people you love support what you\u2019re doing. It\u2019s indescribable.\nEveryone supported me in my decision to quit. It was overwhelming, and I almost couldn\u2019t handle it. I would just randomly break out into tears. That\u2019s how you know you\u2019re on the right track.\nQuitting a job can be freeing and exciting. Leaving a career can be terrifying.\nIf you\u2019re scared but feel there is no other choice than to move toward this new thing, you\u2019re on the right track. If you cannot stomach another meeting, Zoom call, or disagreement about policy, it\u2019s time to head out.\nEvery small move you make toward what you want will compound.

They\u2019re waiting for the house of cards to fall.\nIn reality, it\u2019s here, and it\u2019s not just for crypto-bros. It\u2019s for all of us.\nThis future has arrived, and it is revolutionizing the world. It\u2019s changing the way we do business, and it\u2019s changing the way leaders run countries. If you\u2019re waiting for this fad to die off, you\u2019re going to be waiting forever.\nDeFi will fundamentally change the way humans interact with the world, and it\u2019s being shaped daily. It will most certainly change your life.\nGoodbye fees\nDeFi is just an abbreviation for decentralized finance. All that means is when you own cryptocurrency or NFTs; you are in charge of it. There is no bank. There is freedom in that as well as risk.\nDeFi is a system where software is written on a blockchain. This software makes transactions possible from person to person without any significant financial institution in the middle.\nDeFi literally cuts out the middleman and puts the power in your hands. Guess what it also cuts out?\nFees.\nRegular banks have taxed ordinary people to death. There are fees for everything. ATM fees and overdraft fees are just the beginning. Have you ever needed to wire money? There are fees for that too.\nWe are drowning in fees.\nSometimes the sending bank and the receiving bank both charge fees. What\u2019s up with that?\nThat\u2019s other people getting rich on your money, my friend.\nThere used to be nothing we could do about all these fees. Banks were in charge, and the people at the top made more money every year while we regular folks signed up for direct deposit and hoped our rent would clear on time before we had to put gas in our cars.\nThere is a better way.\nMove money in one second\nHave you ever gone to an ATM to pull cash out and found it out of service? I have. Maybe you had a check that needed cashing, but it was Sunday? Yeah, same here. Overdraft fees? I\u2019m guilty of those too.\nUgh.\nA few weeks ago, I cashed out some stock. It was an arduous process that required more than one phone call.\nWhen it was all said and done, it took about four days for the transaction to be complete and the money to hit my bank account. With DeFi, we can now do this in one second.\nThere are no bank fees and no phone calls; we can move money in one second.\nHello, freedom.\nTransparency emerges as a hero\nDeFi will revolutionize the way we use money. Some old-school financial institutions and governments are shaking at the thought of regular people in charge of their own money.\nThe ones who embrace it will prove their staying power.\nBlockchain technology offers some incredible benefits. The main one is how it records information. It is almost impossible for the information to be hacked or altered.\nWith a blockchain, no one person is in charge. It\u2019s a transparent digital ledger. Every person that uses it can see what goes on within the digital ledger. Each transaction that is processed is recorded on this block.\nIf it gets messed with, it will be visible to all the users. Transparency is a blockchain super-power.\n\u201cYou pair stability with decentralization and transparency, and you get an unstoppable economy.\u201d \u2014 Mariano Conti, former head of smart contracts at MakerDAO.\nDeFi also levels the playing field for regular people.\nDeFi is for everyone\nTransactions are transparent and peer-to-peer. No matter your age, race, or what country you live in, you decide how to handle your funds, not some guy in a suit trying to determine your worth by your last name.\nCryptocurrency and decentralized finance are revolutionizing the way we think about money.\nBlockchain technology gives power back to the 99% of us who don\u2019t run financial institutions or live off a trust fund.\nNo more ATM outages or bank fees. No more loan approvals. It\u2019s your money; do whatever you want with it.\nDeFi is an ecosystem that allows users to control their assets. It will enable us to move them or invest them as we see fit. We are in control.\nBlockchain tech is advancing every second of every day.

No, thank you.\nPhoto by Valerie Elash on Unsplash\nCoordinating a wedding is a monumental task. There are one thousand things to keep track of, manage, and communicate.\nNot to mention, you have to answer the same questions all day long from people \u2014 when? Where? The dress? If you work full-time while doing this, it will consume every free second.\nThis is why wedding planners exist and charge a lot of money.\nI liked planning my wedding. I enjoyed it. However, I\u2019m operationally minded. I tracked all the threads that lead to every vendor rolling up and putting my event together like a flash mob.\nAs you\u2019re thinking about your wedding, something to consider is if you will follow traditions or not.\nThere are a ton of them, as you probably already know. Old, new, borrowed, blue, dances, speeches, and a bouquet toss \u2014 this is just the beginning.\nTradition goes out the window\nMany traditions I didn\u2019t bother doing. I didn\u2019t have an engagement party, bachelorette party, or bridesmaids. Yes, you read that right, we didn\u2019t have a bridal party.\nIt\u2019s crazy expensive to be in someone\u2019s bridal party, and I didn\u2019t want to put that on my friends. Most were coming from out of town, which is a big enough expense.\nAll I wanted was for them to come and enjoy themselves.\nMy husband and I didn\u2019t make space in the evening for speeches. Neither of us wanted them included. I\u2019m not comfortable as the center of attention, and going through the ceremony was enough for me.\nThe thought of sitting in a room full of people while my friends and family got up to say nice things about me or try to make bad jokes filled me with anxiety.\nSkip!\nWe told people ahead of time \u2014 no speeches. This was amazing. There was no preparation and no nerves. Most people dislike public speaking anyway, so they were glad to get out of it.\nWhat I regret\nWhile my wedding went off without a hitch, there are some wedding traditions I regret.\nNo bridal party means getting ready by yourself. I went to get my makeup and hair done by myself. Walking out of the salon in jeans, a t-shirt, and a veil alone felt very Twilight Zone. I should\u2019ve brought a friend.\nMy best friend met me in the hotel room, where I would put on my dress and finish getting ready. I walked in all done up except for my clothes. \u201cYou\u2019re half a bride!\u201d She exclaimed.\nThat\u2019s exactly how I felt.\nTradition says you\u2019re not supposed to see the one you\u2019re marrying the night before the wedding. You avoid each other until right before the ceremony.\nMy husband and I lived together for six years before we got married, so sleeping in different homes felt weird. We did this, but I would never do this again.\nWe were the only two going through this foreign experience together, and the night before, we were apart. It felt lonely. I just wanted to be at home with him.\nI also should\u2019ve thought harder about the cake.\nHave a clear design idea for the cake. I did not. Our cake tasted divine, the decorations I would\u2019ve changed. I had too many ideas when I went in to discuss them. We narrowed it down, but the result wasn\u2019t what I wanted.\nWe erred on letting it be a surprise \u2014 don\u2019t do that.\nOur cake was totally fine; it just wasn\u2019t what I had envisioned. I also think the cake decorator forgot about us and rushed it last minute, but that\u2019s just a theory.\nWe have friends that still rave about that cake, though. It did taste fantastic.\nYou do you\nOur wedding was exactly what we wanted. Most of what we planned was perfect. We got married at a small park overlooking the ocean and had the reception across the street at an art gallery.\nIt was important to me that people could walk from the ceremony site to the reception site. It was perfect. Open bar, good food, a small guest list, and the art galleries were available, so our private party could wander through.\nIt was lovely.\nI\u2019m still happy about everything we decided to throw out the window \u2014 no speeches, no special dances, no undue pressure.\nIn hindsight, the few things I would\u2019ve changed are minor. When I look back, I realize that my husband and I had a good grasp of what was important to us \u2014 individually and as a couple.\nWe followed through with that no matter what anyone else thought.\nThat\u2019s what\u2019s crucial. Figure out what\u2019s important to you and your partner. Let everyone else\u2019s advice be like a buzz in your ear that fades over time.\nWhen you look back on your photos from this day, you\u2019ll want to think, \u201cI\u2019m so happy we did this!\u201d Not \u201cOh my god, that speech by your cousin was torture!\u201d\nStay true to yourself, and it will lead you in the right direction. It\u2019s your day, so make it exactly what you want. You won\u2019t regret it.\nFor more on marriage, check out one of my related articles.\nI\u2019ve Been Married for 15 Years.

You must be ready for anything and anyone to walk into your store.\nFrom soccer moms to drug addicts \u2014 you help them all.\nSome people are friendly and make an effort to talk to you. Some ignore you the entire time you ring them up; they stare at their phones or talk to their friends. Occasionally they conduct business \u2014 they purchase something while they duke it out with their credit card company on the other end of the phone.\nWhatever, man.\nIt\u2019s almost a relief when a customer ignores you. It lets you catch a three-minute break, and you can let your mind wander instead of selling this person on your rewards program.\nEverything will break\nThe AC will leak, the bathroom will break, and water will seep through the windows during torrential downpours (this is an outside mall), and you will have to get it all fixed.\nHornets will decide your windows look like an excellent place to build a nest, and you\u2019ll have to call an expert immediately.\nThere will be break-ins \u2014 a brick through the front glass door, and someone will steal from you every day whether you know it or not.\nYou will work overnight shifts and early mornings. You will haul boxes, dress mannequins, and climb ladders. Part of the day is spent on a dirty floor while finding the proper case for the sunglasses you\u2019re selling.\nYou\u2019ll wash your hands a lot and do everything in your power to not touch your face.\nYou\u2019ll work all the holidays \u2014 Halloween is the best. You get paid to hand out candy, and I\u2019ve been a part of many kids\u2019 first trick-or-treat experiences, and it was always a joy. The two weeks after Christmas are the absolute worst.\nAll the purchases that everyone stressed out to buy all come back. You will have huge piles of clothes at all five of your registers, and you will have to schedule someone just to process returns.\nThe money you eat in returns will come off of your payroll forecast for the week, so you\u2019ll have four people on the floor when you should have eight. Customers won\u2019t understand, and your corporate office won\u2019t care.\nCustomers will also call you to fix all their company-related problems even though you cannot fix most of them. There\u2019s no way for a store to track your package or email you a new coupon. That\u2019s not what we do here.\nThe team makes it all worth it.\nYou will be allowed to be yourself \u2014 quirks and all \u2014 and be accepted.\nYou can laugh with people. You can share your opinion and not get stomped on. Your team will embrace your quirks instead of trying to force you to be something you\u2019re not.\nThe freedom in retail\nAlong with all of the above, which really happened, I had a lot of freedom.\nI made my own schedule. I told my bosses NO and got away with it. I hired positive people. I didn\u2019t tolerate drama or gossip. Everyone had to pull their weight, including me.\nI was 100% myself, and I thrived.\nI can hear the ball as it makes contact with the bat \u2014 crack! Home run.\nWhat a f*cking gift that was.\nRetail gave me a killer skill-set \u2014 I can talk to anyone. Job titles don\u2019t impress me; we all work for money.\nI learned that being in service to a team is the greatest gift. I protected them at all costs. I can change direction on a dime, and I learned early on to control my emotions when others are upset and not to take it personally.\nRetail sharpened my ability to sense fraud and see sketchy behavior from across the room. Every day was a study of human behavior, and I can now more easily tell when someone is lying.\nWhen you work in retail, you must be able to handle about fifty different job titles. IT help, receptionist, referee, older sibling, motivator \u2014 I could go on forever; you get it.\nDo you know how many registers I\u2019ve fixed or internet routers I\u2019ve dusted off, unplugged, and plugged back in? Me either. Countless receipt printers needed fixing, and UPC scanners unplugged with a bent paperclip (don\u2019t ask).\nAnd now?\nSome of my skills are now worthless. It doesn\u2019t matter that I know how to put stickers in a markdown gun \u2014 which is tricky, by the way. It doesn\u2019t matter that I can put a new needle in a ticket gun (also tricky).\nWhat does matter is that I made sure I knew how to do all that sh*t.\nI wanted to know how everything worked and I learned it all. I got to the place where I would pick up the phone and call anyone, help anyone, fix anything. I was great at it. I then turned around and empowered everyone else. Boom!\nWhen I worked in retail, I knocked it out of the park.\nRetail let me be myself, empower others, and thrive. It is physically difficult work, and I didn\u2019t quite realize the toll until I\u2019d been gone for a few months. I stood up from the couch late last night to head to bed and thought \u2014 \u201cOh, my whole body no longer hurts.\u201d\nRetail people are fierce and savvy, getting way too little credit.\nI learned how to run a business with a considerable staff. I worked with all kinds of people of all ages and backgrounds. We all got along and helped out. The team made all the hard work worth it, and now that I work alone, it\u2019s what I miss most.\nWhat\u2019s it really like to work retail?\nIt\u2019s like driving a bus on a curvy highway. You will go through every season, and the bus will break down, and you\u2019ll all pull together to fix it. People will get on, and people will get off; some will keep in touch.\nThe team will rally and keep each other going, including you. Until one day, you decide that you\u2019ve seen enough, and you grab your laptop and head to the nearest cafe.\nRetail is complex and messy and one of the best things I\u2019ve ever done.\nTwo Decades of Leadership & Work Experience in 5 Minutes\n kitcampoy.medium.com\nWant to know how people around the world take breaks?

Code is also a means of communication across a team, a way to describe to others the solution to a problem. Readable code is not a nice-to-have, it is a fundamental part of what writing code is about. This involves factoring code clearly, picking self-explanatory variable names, and inserting comments to describe anything that\u2019s implicit.\nAsk not what your pull request can do for your next promotion, ask what your pull request can do for your users and your community. Avoid \u201cconspicuous contribution\u201d at all cost. Let no feature be added if it isn\u2019t clearly helping with the purpose of your product.\nTaste applies to code, too. Taste is a constraint-satisfaction process regularized by a desire for simplicity. Keep a bias toward simplicity.\nIt\u2019s okay to say no \u2014 just because someone asks for a feature doesn\u2019t mean you should do it. Every feature has a cost that goes beyond the initial implementation: maintenance cost, documentation cost, and cognitive cost for your users. Always ask: Should we really do this? Often, the answer is simply no.\nWhen you say yes to a request for supporting a new use case, remember that literally adding what the user requested is often not the optimal choice. Users are focused on their own specific use case, and you must counter this with a holistic and principled vision of the whole project. Often, the right answer is to extend an existing feature.\nInvest in continuous integration and aim for full unit test coverage. Make sure you are in an environment where you can code with confidence; if that isn\u2019t the case, start by focusing on building the right infrastructure.\nIt\u2019s okay not to plan everything in advance. Try things and see how they turn out. Revert incorrect choices early. Make sure you create an environment where that is possible.\nGood software makes hard things easy. Just because a problem looks difficult at first doesn\u2019t mean the solution will have to be complex or hard to use. Too often, engineers go with reflex solutions that introduce undesirable complexity (Let\u2019s use ML! Let\u2019s build an app! Let\u2019s add blockchain!) in situations where a far easier, though maybe less obvious, alternative is available. Before you write any code, make sure your solution of choice cannot be made any simpler. Approach everything from first principles.\nAvoid implicit rules. Implicit rules that you find yourself developing should always be made explicit and shared with others or automated. Whenever you find yourself coming up with a recurring, quasi-algorithmic workflow, you should seek to formalize it into a documented process, so that other team members will benefit from the experience. In addition, you should seek to automate in software any part of such a workflow that can be automated (e.g., correctness checks).\nThe total impact of your choices should be taken into account in the design process, not just the bits you want to focus on \u2014 such as revenue or growth. Beyond the metrics you are monitoring, what total impact does your software have on its users, on the world? Are there undesirable side effects that outweigh the value proposition? What can you do to address them while preserving the software\u2019s usefulness?\nDesign for ethics. Bake your values into your creations.\nOn API Design\nYour API has users, thus it has a user experience. In every decision you make, always keep the user in mind. Have empathy for your users, whether they are beginners or experienced developers.\nAlways seek to minimize the cognitive load imposed on your users in the course of using your API. Automate what can be automated, minimize the actions and choices needed from the user, don\u2019t expose options that are unimportant, design simple and consistent workflows that reflect simple and consistent mental models.\nSimple things should be simple, complex things should be possible. Don\u2019t increase the cognitive load of common use cases for the sake of niche use cases, even minimally.\nIf the cognitive load of a workflow is sufficiently low, it should be possible for a user to go through it from memory (without looking up a tutorial or documentation) after having done it once or twice.\nSeek to have an API that matches the mental models of domain experts and practitioners. Someone who has domain experience, but no experience with your API, should be able to intuitively understand your API using minimal documentation, mostly just by looking at a couple of code examples and seeing what objects are available and what their signatures are.\nThe meaning of an argument should be understandable without having any context about the underlying implementation. Arguments that have to be specified by users should relate to the mental models that the users have about the problem, not to implementation details in your code. An API is all about the problem it solves, not about how the software works in the background.\nThe most powerful mental models are modular and hierarchical: simple at a high level, yet precise as you need to go into details. In the same way, a good API is modular and hierarchical: easy to approach, yet expressive. There is a balance to strike between having complex signatures on fewer objects, and having more objects with simpler signatures. A good API has a reasonable number of objects, with reasonably simple signatures.\nYour API is inevitably a reflection of your implementation choices, in particular your choice of data structures. To achieve an intuitive API, you must choose data structures that naturally fit the domain at hand \u2014 that match the mental models of domain experts.\nDeliberately design end-to-end workflows, not a set of atomic features. Most developers approach API design by asking: What capabilities should be available? Let\u2019s have configuration options for them. Instead, ask: What are the use cases for this tool? For each use case, what is the optimal sequence of user actions? What\u2019s the easiest API that could support this workflow? Atomic options in your API should answer a clear need that arises in a high-level workflow \u2014 they should not be added \u201cbecause someone might need it.\u201d\nError messages, and in general any feedback provided to a user in the course of interacting with your API, is part of the API. Interactivity and feedback are integral to the user experience. Design your API\u2019s error messages deliberately.\nBecause code is communication, naming matters \u2014 whether naming a project or a variable. Names reflect how you think about a problem. Avoid overly generic names (x, variable, parameter), avoid OverlyLongAndSpecificNamingPatterns, avoid terms that can create unnecessary friction (master, slave), and make sure you are consistent in your naming choices. Naming consistency means both internal naming consistency (don\u2019t call \u201cdim\u201d what is called \u201caxis\u201d in other places) and consistency with established conventions for the problem domain. Before settling on a name, make sure to look up existing names used by domain experts (or other APIs).\nDocumentation is central to the user experience of your API. It is not an add-on. Invest in high-quality documentation; you will see higher returns than investing in more features.\nShow, don\u2019t tell: Your documentation should not talk about how the software works, it should show how to use it. Show code examples for end-to-end workflows; show code examples for each and every common use case and key feature of your API.\nProductivity boils down to high-velocity decision-making and a bias for action.\nOn Software Careers\nCareer progress is not how many people you manage, it is how much of an impact you make: the differential between a world with and without your work.\nSoftware development is teamwork; it is about relationships as much as it is about technical ability. Be a good teammate. As you go on your way, stay in touch with people.\nTechnology is never neutral. If your work has any impact on the world, then this impact has a moral direction. The seemingly innocuous technical choices we make in software products modulate the terms of access to technology, its usage incentives, who will benefit, and who will suffer. Technical choices are also ethical choices. Thus, always be deliberate and explicit about the values you want your choices to support. Design for ethics. Bake your values into your creations. Never think, I\u2019m just building the capability; that in itself is neutral. It is not because the way you build it determines how it will get used.\nSelf-direction \u2014 agency over your work and your circumstances \u2014 is the key to life satisfaction. Make sure you grant sufficient self-direction to the people around you, and make sure your career choices result in greater agency for yourself.\nBuild what the world needs \u2014 not just what you wish you had. Too often, technologists live rarefied lives and focus on products catering to their own specific needs. Seek opportunities to broaden your life experience, which will give you better visibility into what the world needs.\nWhen making any choice with long-term repercussions, place your values above short-term self-interest and passing emotions \u2014 such as greed or fear. Know what your values are, and let them guide you.\nWhen we find ourselves in a conflict, it\u2019s a good idea to pause to acknowledge our shared values and our shared goals, and remind ourselves that we are, almost certainly, on the same side.\nProductivity boils down to high-velocity decision-making and a bias for action. This requires a) good intuition, which comes from experience, so as to make generally correct decisions given partial information, b) a keen awareness of when to move more carefully and wait for more information, because the cost of an incorrect decision would be greater than cost of the delay. The optimal velocity/quality decision-making tradeoff can vary greatly in different environments.\nMaking decisions faster means you make more decisions over the course of your career, which will give you stronger intuition about the correctness of available options. Experience is key to productivity, and greater productivity will provide you with more experience: a virtuous cycle.\nIn situations where you are aware that your intuition is lacking, adhere to abstract principles. Build up lists of tried-and-true principles throughout your career. Principles are formalized intuition that generalize to a broader range of situations than raw pattern recognition (which requires direct and extensive experience of similar situations).", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 17458, "created_time": 1536429207527, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Software Development", "Work", "Programming", "Self", "Productivity"]}, {"author": "Fran\u00e7ois Chollet", "post_id": "a3ba7d3a66a2", "user_id": "7462d2319de7", "title": "The memories around us", "content": "The memories around us\n\nDecember 2018. An empty field somewhere in France. The nearest house is one kilometer away. It\u2019s freezing cold. What am I doing here?\nEvery place has a memory. Perhaps dreams. This one has nightmares. Nearly a hundred people were massacred right on this spot.\nI am possibly the very last person to know that it happened.\nThis is a story that begins in 1859\u2026\nWait, no. It begins during the fall of the Roman empire. But let\u2019s make a first stop in 1859.\nIn 1859, this field had a name. In English, it would translate to \u201cBlacklands\u201d. This name is long forgotten, and you won\u2019t find it on any 20th century map.\nAcross the Blacklands was a rather extensive mound of earth and rocks. The owner of the Blacklands decided to get rid of the mound in order to improve the yield of his lands. He started digging.\nSoon after, he began to uncover walls.\nIt was the ruins of a large building, one hundred meters by ten meters, divided into many rooms. Fifty meters to the south were more buildings. He had found a vast Gallo-Roman villa. The ruins were full of debris: cement, tiles, broken pottery, bronze coins, and small polished stones used for floor mosaics.\nAs people systematically dismantled the ruins, they found bones in the main room of the main building. Human bones. Lots of them.\nBy the time they were done, they had unearthed eighty human skeletons, men and women, adults and children. They were the inhabitants of the villa, masters and servants, who had perished together in the destruction of the complex in the 3rd or 5th century AD. Numerous animal bones were also found in the auxiliary buildings.\nAmong those who witnessed this was S. N., a friend of the land owner. A cultivator, he was an intelligent man who, despite not having had any secondary education, happened to be fond of ancient history. It is thanks to his involvement that we have a written trace of what happened.\nIn 1859, archeology was in its infancy, and the preservation of ancient sites was not a concern, especially in the remote countryside. But S. N. understood that the discovery was significant, and he kept notes of everything that had been found.\nIn 1862, a local historical society was founded in the nearest town, fifteen kilometers away. S. N. was not sufficiently well-connected to join it at first, but he eventually did in 1868, and he published a short article relating the discovery in the quarterly journal of the society. His article is surprisingly well-written, rigorous, and scientific, albeit it is missing many important details.\nOnly a handful of people would have read about it back then. The discovery gained a little more coverage when it was mentioned a century later, in 1969, in a book about local history that may have had readership numbering in the hundreds. The mention is little more than a quote of S. N.\u2019s article, which is the sole primary source of information we have. By then, the \u201cBlacklands\u201d had already faded from memory.\nThe villa had become a story, a rumor. The field laid in anonymity.\nBack to the last days of 2018. I read the book. I found S. N.\u2019s original article from 1868. I used the Napoleonic cadastre (1812 land registry) to determine the exact location of the Blacklands.\nAnd I came here, to this empty field in the middle of nowhere.\nThe 1812 cadastre superimposed with modern satellite imagery. Note that the name \u201cBlacklands\u201d was translated from French.\nEvery place has a memory. Some places are a memory, a record, layer after layer of history. The villa that once stood on this ground has eventually become the ground. Two of the most common \u201crocks\u201d in this field are red tile fragments and chunks of roman cement.\n\nHere are a few examples of roof tiles and a chunk of cement. The cement embeds small fossils that come from the sand used to make it.\n\nIn less than forty minutes on location, I was able to gather a kilogram or so of Gallo-Roman pottery fragments, from a range of styles. I literally just had to pick them up. The ground is made of them. I also found what appears to be a bone fragment, and part of a large animal tooth.\n\nMost of the pottery is fairly crude. But some of it features brown paint or a faded dark red coating. Some fragments bear imprinted decorative patterns (sigillata). Those were likely tableware. None of it is of any particular archeological value.\nSigillata\nWhat happened here exactly? How did these people die? Who killed them? When did it happen?\nSome of the bricks and pot fragments bear the marks of an intense fire. Most likely, the eighty men and women were barricaded in the main building, which was set ablaze by barbarian raiders. Unable to get out, they died there, and their bodies were buried as the building collapsed.\nCharred pottery and tile\nI believe it may have happened in an early Frank or Alaman raid in 275\u2013276 AD (most likely hypothesis given the information available), or in 409\u2013410, or in 451 (Attila).\nIf I could see some of the bronze coins that were retrieved, I could try to date these events more precisely. As it is, nothing is known of the whereabouts of the coins, pottery, and eighty human skeletons that were dug out in 1859.\nMany questions still to be answered.\nOriginally posted as a Twitter thread in December 2018.", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 696, "created_time": 1546168179615, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["History", "Archaeology"]}, {"author": "Fran\u00e7ois Chollet", "post_id": "ed9df072b704", "user_id": "7462d2319de7", "title": "What worries me about AI", "content": "What worries me about AI\nDisclaimer: These are my own personal views. I do not speak for my employer. If you quote this article, please have the honesty to present these ideas as what they are: personal, speculative opinions, to be judged on their own merits.\nIf you were around in the 1980s and 1990s, you may remember the now-extinct phenomenon of \u201ccomputerphobia\u201d. I have personally witnessed it a few times as late as the early 2000s \u2014 as personal computers were introduced into our lives, in our workplaces and homes, quite a few people would react with anxiety, fear, or even aggressivity. While some of us were fascinated by computers and awestruck by the potential they could glimpse in them, most people didn\u2019t understand them. They felt alien, abstruse, and in many ways, threatening. People feared getting replaced by technology.\nMost of us react to technological shifts with unease at best, panic at worst. Maybe that is true of any change at all. But remarkably, most of what we worry about ends up never happening.\nFast-forward a few years, and the computer-haters have learned to live with them and to use them for their own benefit. Computers did not replace us and trigger mass unemployment \u2014 and nowadays we couldn\u2019t imagine life without our laptops, tablets, and smartphones. Threatening change has become comfortable status quo. But at the same time as our fears failed to materialize, computers and the internet have enabled threats that almost no one was warning us about in the 1980s and 1990s. Ubiquitous mass surveillance. Hackers going after our infrastructure or our personal data. Psychological alienation on social media. The loss of our patience and our ability to focus. The political or religious radicalization of easily-influenced minds online. Hostile foreign powers hijacking social networks to disrupt Western democracies.\nIf most of our fears turn out to be irrational, inversely, most of the truly worrying developments that have happened in the past as a result of technological change stem from things that most people didn\u2019t worry about until it was already there. A hundred years ago, we couldn\u2019t really forecast that the transportation and manufacturing technologies we were developing would enable a new form of industrial warfare that would wipe out tens of millions in two World Wars. We didn\u2019t recognize early on that the invention of the radio would enable a new form of mass propaganda that would facilitate the rise of fascism in Italy and Germany. The progress of theoretical physics in the 1920s and 1930s wasn\u2019t accompanied by anxious press articles about how these developments would soon enable thermonuclear weapons that would place the world forever under the threat of imminent annihilation. And today, even as alarms have been sounding for decades about the most dire problem of our times, climate, a large fraction (44%) of the American public still chooses to ignore it. As a civilization, we seem to be really bad at correctly identifying future threats and rightfully worrying about them, just as we seem to be extremely prone to panic due to irrational fears.\nToday, like many times in the past, we are faced with a new wave of radical change: cognitive automation, which could be broadly summed up under the keyword \u201cAI\u201d. And like many time in the past, we are worried that this new set of technologies will harm us \u2014 that AI will lead to mass unemployment, or that AI will gain an agency of its own, become superhuman, and choose to destroy us.\nImage source: facebook.com/zuck\nBut what if we\u2019re worrying about the wrong thing, like we have almost every single time before? What if the real danger of AI was far remote from the \u201csuperintelligence\u201d and \u201csingularity\u201d narratives that many are panicking about today? In this post, I\u2019d like to raise awareness about what really worries me when it comes to AI: the highly effective, highly scalable manipulation of human behavior that AI enables, and its malicious use by corporations and governments. Of course, this is not the only tangible risk that arises from the development of cognitive technologies \u2014 there are many others, in particular issues related to the harmful biases of machine learning models. Other people are raising awareness of these problems far better than I could. I chose to write about mass population manipulation specifically because I see this risk as pressing and direly under-appreciated.\nThis risk is already a reality today, and a number of long-term technological trends are going to considerably amplify it over the next few decades. As our lives become increasingly digitized, social media companies get ever greater visibility into our lives and minds. At the same time, they gain increasing access to behavioral control vectors \u2014 in particular via algorithmic newsfeeds, which control our information consumption. This casts human behavior as an optimization problem, as an AI problem: it becomes possible for social media companies to iteratively tune their control vectors in order to achieve specific behaviors, just like a game AI would iterative refine its play strategy in order to beat a level, driven by score feedback. The only bottleneck to this process is the intelligence of the algorithm in the loop \u2014 and as it happens, the largest social network company is currently investing billions in fundamental AI research.\nLet me explain in detail.\nSocial media as a psychological panopticon\nIn the past 20 years, our private and public lives have moved online. We spend an ever greater fraction of each day staring at screens. Our world is moving to a state where most of what we do consists of digital information consumption, modification, or creation.\nA side effect of this long-term trend is that corporations and governments are now collecting staggering amounts of data about us, in particular through social network services. Who we communicate with. What we say. What content we\u2019ve been consuming \u2014 images, movies, music, news. What mood we are in at specific times. Ultimately, almost everything we perceive and everything we do will end up recorded on some remote server.\nThis data, in theory, allows the entities that collect it to build extremely accurate psychological profiles of both individuals and groups. Your opinions and behavior can be cross-correlated with that of thousands of similar people, achieving an uncanny understanding of what makes you tick \u2014 probably more predictive than what yourself could achieve through mere introspection (for instance, Facebook \u201clikes\u201d enable algorithms to better assess your personality that your own friends could). This data makes it possible to predict a few days in advance when you will start a new relationship (and with whom), and when you will end your current one. Or who is at risk of suicide. Or which side you will ultimately vote for in an election, even while you\u2019re still feeling undecided. And it\u2019s not just individual-level profiling power \u2014 large groups can be even more predictable, as aggregating data points erases randomness and individual outliers.\nDigital information consumption as a psychological control vector\nPassive data collection is not where it ends. Increasingly, social network services are in control of what information we consume. What see in our newsfeeds has become algorithmically \u201ccurated\u201d. Opaque social media algorithms get to decide, to an ever-increasing extent, which political articles we read, which movie trailers we see, who we keep in touch with, whose feedback we receive on the opinions we express.\nIntegrated over many years of exposure, the algorithmic curation of the information we consume gives the algorithms in charge considerable power over our lives \u2014 over who we are, who we become. If Facebook gets to decide, over the span of many years, which news you will see (real or fake), whose political status updates you\u2019ll see, and who will see yours, then Facebook is in effect in control of your worldview and your political beliefs.\nFacebook\u2019s business lies in influencing people. That\u2019s what the service it sells to its customers \u2014 advertisers, including political advertisers. As such, Facebook has built a fine-tuned algorithmic engine that does just that. This engine isn\u2019t merely capable of influencing your view of a brand or your next smart-speaker purchase. It can influence your mood, tuning the content it feeds you in order to make you angry or happy, at will. It may even be able to swing elections.\nHuman behavior as an optimization problem\nIn short, social network companies can simultaneously measure everything about us, and control the information we consume. And that\u2019s an accelerating trend. When you have access to both perception and action, you\u2019re looking at an AI problem. You can start establishing an optimization loop for human behavior, in which you observe the current state of your targets and keep tuning what information you feed them, until you start observing the opinions and behaviors you wanted to see. A large subset of the field of AI \u2014 in particular \u201creinforcement learning\u201d \u2014 is about developing algorithms to solve such optimization problems as efficiently as possible, to close the loop and achieve full control of the target at hand \u2014 in this case, us. By moving our lives to the digital realm, we become vulnerable to that which rules it \u2014 AI algorithms.\nA reinforcement learning loop for human behavior\nThis is made all the easier by the fact that the human mind is highly vulnerable to simple patterns of social manipulation. Consider, for instance, the following vectors of attack:\nIdentity reinforcement: this is an old trick that has been leveraged since the first very ads in history, and still works just as well as it did the first time, consisting of associating a given view with markers that you identify with (or wish you did), thus making you automatically siding with the target view. In the context of AI-optimized social media consumption, a control algorithm could make sure that you only see content (whether news stories or posts from your friends) where the views it wants you to hold co-occur with your own identity markers, and inversely for views the algorithm wants you to move away from.\nNegative social reinforcement: if you make a post expressing a view that the control algorithm doesn\u2019t want you to hold, the system can choose to only show your post to people who hold the opposite view (maybe acquaintances, maybe strangers, maybe bots), and who will harshly criticize it. Repeated many times, such social backlash is likely to make you move away from your initial views.\nPositive social reinforcement: if you make a post expressing a view that the control algorithm wants to spread, it can choose to only show it to people who will \u201clike\u201d it (it could even be bots). This will reinforce your belief and put you under the impression that you are part of a supportive majority.\nSampling bias: the algorithm may also be more likely to show you posts from your friends (or the media at large) that support the views it wants you to hold. Placed in such an information bubble, you will be under the impression that these views have much broader support than they do in reality.\nArgument personalization: the algorithm may observe that exposure to certain pieces of content, among people with a psychological profile close to yours, has resulted in the sort of view shift it seeks. It may then serve you with content that is expected to be maximally effective for someone with your particular views and life experience. In the long run, the algorithm may even be able to generate such maximally-effective content from scratch, specifically for you.\nFrom an information security perspective, you would call these vulnerabilities: known exploits that can be used to take over a system. In the case of the human minds, these vulnerabilities never get patched, they are just the way we work. They\u2019re in our DNA. The human mind is a static, vulnerable system that will come increasingly under attack from ever-smarter AI algorithms that will simultaneously have a complete view of everything we do and believe, and complete control of the information we consume.\nThe current landscape\nRemarkably, mass population manipulation \u2014 in particular political control \u2014 arising from placing AI algorithms in charge of our information diet does not necessarily require very advanced AI. You don\u2019t need self-aware, superintelligent AI for this to be a dire threat \u2014 current technology may well suffice. Social network companies have been working on it for a few years, with significant results. And while they may only be trying to maximize \u201cengagement\u201d and to influence your purchase decisions, rather than to manipulate your view of the world, the tools they\u2019ve developed are already being hijacked by hostile state actors for political purposes \u2014 as seen in the 2016 Brexit referendum or the 2016 US presidential election. This is already our reality. But if mass population manipulation is already possible today \u2014 in theory \u2014 why hasn\u2019t the world been upended yet?\nIn short, I think it\u2019s because we\u2019re really bad at AI. But that may be about to change.\nUntil 2015, all ad targeting algorithms across the industry were running on mere logistic regression. In fact, that\u2019s still true to a large extent today \u2014 only the biggest players have switched to more advanced models. Logistic regression, an algorithm that predates the computing era, is one of the most basic techniques you could use for personalization. It is the reason why so many of the ads you see online are desperately irrelevant. Likewise, the social media bots used by hostile state actors to sway public opinion have little to no AI in them. They\u2019re all extremely primitive. For now.\nMachine learning and AI have been making fast progress in recent years, and that progress is only beginning to get deployed in targeting algorithms and social media bots. Deep learning has only started to make its way into newsfeeds and ad networks in 2016. Who knows what will be next. It is quite striking that Facebook has been investing enormous amounts in AI research and development, with the explicit goal of becoming a leader in the field. When your product is a social newsfeed, what use are you going to make of natural language processing and reinforcement learning?\nWe\u2019re looking at a company that builds fine-grained psychological profiles of almost two billion humans, that serves as a primary news source for many of them, that runs large-scale behavior manipulation experiments, and that aims at developing the best AI technology the world has ever seen. Personally, it scares me. And consider that Facebook may not even be the most worrying threat here. Ponder, for instance, China\u2019s use of information control to enable unprecedented forms of totalitarianism, such as its \u201csocial credit system\u201d. Many people like to pretend that large corporations are the all-powerful rulers of the modern world, but what power they hold is dwarfed by that of governments. If given algorithmic control over our minds, governments may well turn into far worst actors than corporations.\nNow, what can we do about it? How can we defend ourselves? As technologists, what can we do to avert the risk of mass manipulation via our social newsfeeds?\nThe flip side of the coin: what AI can do for us\nImportantly, the existence of this threat doesn\u2019t mean that all algorithmic curation is bad, or that all targeted advertising is bad. Far from it. Both of these can serve a valuable purpose.\nWith the rise of the Internet and AI, placing algorithms in charge of our information diet isn\u2019t just an inevitable trend \u2014 it\u2019s a desirable one. As our lives become increasingly digital and connected, and as our world becomes increasingly information-intensive, we will need AI to serve as our interface to the world. In the long-run, education and self-development will be some of the most impactful applications of AI \u2014 and this will happen through dynamics that almost entirely mirror that of a nefarious AI-enabled newsfeed trying to manipulate you. Algorithmic information management has tremendous potential to help us, to empower individuals to realize more of their potential, and to help society better manage itself.\nThe issue is not AI itself. The issue is control.\nInstead of letting newsfeed algorithms manipulate the user to achieve opaque goals, such as swaying their political opinions, or maximally wasting their time, we should put the user in charge of the goals that the algorithms optimize for. We are talking, after all, about your news, your worldview, your friends, your life \u2014 the impact that technology has on you should naturally be placed under your own control. Information management algorithms should not be a mysterious force inflicted on us to serve ends that run opposite to our own interests; instead, they should be a tool in our hand. A tool that we can use for our own purposes, say, for education and personal instead of entertainment.\nHere\u2019s an idea \u2014 any algorithmic newsfeed with significant adoption should:\nTransparently convey what objectives the feed algorithm is currently optimizing for, and how these objectives are affecting your information diet.\nGive you intuitive tools to set these goals yourself. For instance, it should be possible for you to configure your newsfeed to maximize learning and personal growth \u2014 in specific directions.\nFeature an always-visible measure of how much time you are spending on the feed.\nFeature tools to stay control of how much time you\u2019re spending on the feed \u2014 such as a daily time target, past which the algorithm will seek to get you off the feed.\nAugmenting ourselves with AI while retaining control\nWe should build AI to serve humans, not to manipulate them for profit or political gain. What if newsfeed algorithms didn\u2019t operate like casino operators or propagandists? What if instead, they were closer to a mentor or a good librarian, someone who used their keen understanding of your psychology \u2014 and that of millions of other similar people \u2014 to recommend to you that next book that will most resonate with your objectives and make you grow. A sort of navigation tool for your life \u2014 an AI capable of guiding you through the optimal path in experience space to get where you want to go. Can you imagine looking at your own life through the lens of a system that has seen millions of lives unfold? Or writing a book together with a system that has read every book? Or conducting research in collaboration with a system that sees the full scope of current human knowledge?\nIn products where you are fully in control of the AI that interacts with you, a more sophisticated algorithm, instead of being a threat, would be a net positive, letting you achieve your own goals more efficiently.\nBuilding the anti-Facebook\nIn summary, our future is one where AI will be our interface to the world \u2014 a world made of digital information. This can equally lead to empowering individuals to gain greater control over their lives, or to a total loss of agency. Unfortunately, social media is currently engaged on the wrong road. But it\u2019s still early enough that we can reverse course.\nAs an industry, we need to develop product categories and markets where the incentives are aligned with placing the user in charge of the algorithms that affect them, instead of using AI to exploit the user\u2019s mind for profit or political gain. We need to strive towards products that are the anti-Facebook.\nIn the far future, such products will likely take the form of AI assistants. Digital mentors programmed to help you, that put you in control of the objectives they pursue in their interactions with you. And in the present, search engines could be seen as an early, more primitive example of an AI-driven information interface that serves users instead of seeking to hijack their mental space. Search is a tool that you deliberately use to reach specific goals, rather than a passive always-on feed that elects what to show you. You tell it what to it should do for you. And instead of seeking to maximally waste your time, a search engine attempts to minimize the time it takes to go from question to answer, from problem to solution.\nYou may be thinking, since a search engine is still an AI layer between us and the information we consume, could it bias its results to attempt to manipulate us? Yes, that risk is latent in every information-management algorithm. But in stark contrast with social networks, market incentives in this case are actually aligned with users needs, pushing search engines to be as relevant and objective as possible. If they fail to be maximally useful, there\u2019s essentially no friction for users to move to a competing product. And importantly, a search engine would have a considerably smaller psychological attack surface than a social newsfeed. The threat we\u2019ve profiled in this post requires most of the following to be present in a product:\nBoth perception and action: not only should the product be in control of the information it shows you (news and social updates), it should also be able to \u201cperceive\u201d your current mental states via \u201clikes\u201d, chat messages, and status updates. Without both perception and action, no reinforcement learning loop can be established. A read-only feed would only be dangerous as a potential avenue for classical propaganda.\nCentrality to our lives: the product should be a major source of information for at least a subset of its users, and typical users should be spending several hours per day on it. A feed that is auxiliary and specialized (such as Amazon\u2019s product recommendations) would not be a serious threat.\nA social component, enabling a far broader and more effective array of psychological control vectors (in particular social reinforcement). An impersonal newsfeed has only a fraction of the leverage over our minds.\nBusiness incentives set towards manipulating users and making users spend more time on the product.\nMost AI-driven information-management products don\u2019t meet these requirements. Social networks, on the other hand, are a frightening combination of risk factors. As technologists, we should gravitate towards products that do not feature these characteristics, and push back against products that combine them all, if only because of their potential for dangerous misuse. Build search engines and digital assistants, not social newsfeeds. Make your recommendation engines transparent, configurable, and constructive, rather than slot-like machines that maximize \u201cengagement\u201d and wasted hours of human time. Invest your UI, UX, and AI expertise into building great configuration panels for your algorithm, to enable your users to use your product on their own terms.\nAnd importantly, we should educate users about these issues, so that they reject manipulative products, generating enough market pressure to align the incentives of the technology industry with that of consumers.\nConclusion: the fork in the road ahead\nNot only does social media know enough about us to build powerful psychological models of both individuals and groups, it is also increasingly in control of our information diet. It has access to a set of extremely effective psychological exploits to manipulate what we believe, how we feel, and what we do.\nA sufficiently advanced AI algorithm with access to both perception of our mental state, and action over our mental state, in a continuous loop, can be used to effectively hijack our beliefs and behavior.\nUsing AI as our interface to information isn\u2019t the problem per se. Such AI interfaces, if well-designed, have the potential to be tremendously beneficial and empowering for all of us. The key factor: the user should stay fully in control of the algorithm\u2019s objectives, using it as a tool to pursue their own goals (in the same way that you would use a search engine).\nAs technologists, we have a responsibility to push back against products that take away control, and dedicate our efforts to building information interfaces that place the user in charge. Don\u2019t use AI as a tool to manipulate your users; instead, give AI to your users as a tool to gain greater agency over their circumstances.\nOne path leads to a place that really scares me. The other leads to a more humane future. There\u2019s still time to take the better one. If you work on these technologies, keep this in mind. You may not have evil intentions. You may simply not care. You may simply value your RSUs more than our shared future. But whether or not you care, because you have a hand in shaping the infrastructure of the digital world, your choices affect us all. And you may eventually be held responsible for them.", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 20839, "created_time": 1522252336511, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Artificial Intelligence", "Social Media", "Technology"]}, {"author": "Fran\u00e7ois Chollet", "post_id": "5be4a9eda6ec", "user_id": "7462d2319de7", "title": "The implausibility of intelligence explosion", "content": "The implausibility of intelligence explosion\nTranscendence (2014 science-fiction movie)\nIn 1965, I. J. Good described for the first time the notion of \u201cintelligence explosion\u201d, as it relates to artificial intelligence (AI):\nLet an ultraintelligent machine be defined as a machine that can far surpass all the intellectual activities of any man however clever. Since the design of machines is one of these intellectual activities, an ultraintelligent machine could design even better machines; there would then unquestionably be an \u201cintelligence explosion,\u201d and the intelligence of man would be left far behind.

Famous business leaders are casting it as a major risk, greater than nuclear war or climate change. Average graduate students in machine learning are endorsing it. In a 2015 email survey targeting AI researchers, 29% of respondents answered that intelligence explosion was \u201clikely\u201d or \u201chighly likely\u201d. A further 21% considered it a serious possibility.\nThe basic premise is that, in the near future, a first \u201cseed AI\u201d will be created, with general problem-solving abilities slightly surpassing that of humans. This seed AI would start designing better AIs, initiating a recursive self-improvement loop that would immediately leave human intelligence in the dust, overtaking it by orders of magnitude in a short time. Proponents of this theory also regard intelligence as a kind of superpower, conferring its holders with almost supernatural capabilities to shape their environment \u2014 as seen in the science-fiction movie Transcendence (2014), for instance. Superintelligence would thus imply near-omnipotence, and would pose an existential threat to humanity.\nThis science-fiction narrative contributes to the dangerously misleading public debate that is ongoing about the risks of AI and the need for AI regulation. In this post, I argue that intelligence explosion is impossible \u2014 that the notion of intelligence explosion comes from a profound misunderstanding of both the nature of intelligence and the behavior of recursively self-augmenting systems. I attempt to base my points on concrete observations about intelligent systems and recursive systems.\nA flawed reasoning that stems from a misunderstanding of intelligence\nThe reasoning behind intelligence explosion, like many of the early theories about AI that arose in the 1960s and 1970s, is sophistic: it considers \u201cintelligence\u201d in a completely abstract way, disconnected from its context, and ignores available evidence about both intelligent systems and recursively self-improving systems. It doesn\u2019t have to be that way. We are, after all, on a planet that is literally packed with intelligent systems (including us) and self-improving systems, so we can simply observe them and learn from them to answer the questions at hand, instead of coming up with evidence-free circular reasonings.\nTo talk about intelligence and its possible self-improving properties, we should first introduce necessary background and context. What are we talking about when we talk about intelligence? Precisely defining intelligence is in itself a challenge. The intelligence explosion narrative equates intelligence with the general problem-solving ability displayed by individual intelligent agents \u2014 by current human brains, or future electronic brains. This is not quite the full picture, so let\u2019s use this definition as a starting point, and expand on it.\nIntelligence is situational\nThe first issue I see with the intelligence explosion theory is a failure to recognize that intelligence is necessarily part of a broader system \u2014 a vision of intelligence as a \u201cbrain in jar\u201d that can be made arbitrarily intelligent independently of its situation. A brain is just a piece of biological tissue, there is nothing intrinsically intelligent about it. Beyond your brain, your body and senses \u2014 your sensorimotor affordances \u2014 are a fundamental part of your mind. Your environment is a fundamental part of your mind. Human culture is a fundamental part of your mind. These are, after all, where all of your thoughts come from. You cannot dissociate intelligence from the context in which it expresses itself.\nIn particular, there is no such thing as \u201cgeneral\u201d intelligence. On an abstract level, we know this for a fact via the \u201cno free lunch\u201d theorem \u2014 stating that no problem-solving algorithm can outperform random chance across all possible problems. If intelligence is a problem-solving algorithm, then it can only be understood with respect to a specific problem. In a more concrete way, we can observe this empirically in that all intelligent systems we know are highly specialized. The intelligence of the AIs we build today is hyper specialized in extremely narrow tasks \u2014 like playing Go, or classifying images into 10,000 known categories. The intelligence of an octopus is specialized in the problem of being an octopus. The intelligence of a human is specialized in the problem of being human.\nWhat would happen if we were to put a freshly-created human brain in the body of an octopus, and let in live at the bottom of the ocean? Would it even learn to use its eight-legged body? Would it survive past a few days? We cannot perform this experiment, but we do know that cognitive development in humans and animals is driven by hardcoded, innate dynamics. Human babies are born with an advanced set of reflex behaviors and innate learning templates that drive their early sensorimotor development, and that are fundamentally intertwined with the structure of the human sensorimotor space. The brain has hardcoded conceptions of having a body with hands that can grab, a mouth that can suck, eyes mounted on a moving head that can be used to visually follow objects (the vestibulo-ocular reflex), and these preconceptions are required for human intelligence to start taking control of the human body. It has even been convincingly argued, for instance by Chomsky, that very high-level human cognitive features, such as our ability to develop language, are innate.\nSimilarly, one can imagine that the octopus has its own set of hardcoded cognitive primitives required in order to learn how to use an octopus body and survive in its octopus environment. The brain of a human is hyper specialized in the human condition \u2014 an innate specialization extending possibly as far as social behaviors, language, and common sense \u2014 and the brain of an octopus would likewise be hyper specialized in octopus behaviors. A human baby brain properly grafted in an octopus body would most likely fail to adequately take control of its unique sensorimotor space, and would quickly die off. Not so smart now, Mr. Superior Brain.\nWhat would happen if we were to put a human \u2014 brain and body \u2014 into an environment that does not feature human culture as we know it? Would Mowgli the man-cub, raised by a pack of wolves, grow up to outsmart his canine siblings? To be smart like us? And if we swapped baby Mowgli with baby Einstein, would he eventually educate himself into developing grand theories of the universe? Empirical evidence is relatively scarce, but from what we know, children that grow up outside of the nurturing environment of human culture don\u2019t develop any human intelligence. Feral children raised in the wild from their earliest years become effectively animals, and can no longer acquire human behaviors or language when returning to civilization. Saturday Mthiyane, raised by monkeys in South Africa and found at five, kept behaving like a monkey into adulthood \u2014 jumping and walking on all four, incapable of language, and refusing to eat cooked food. Feral children who have human contact for at least some of their most formative years tend to have slightly better luck with reeducation, although they rarely graduate to fully-functioning humans.\nIf intelligence is fundamentally linked to specific sensorimotor modalities, a specific environment, a specific upbringing, and a specific problem to solve, then you cannot hope to arbitrarily increase the intelligence of an agent merely by tuning its brain \u2014 no more than you can increase the throughput of a factory line by speeding up the conveyor belt. Intelligence expansion can only come from a co-evolution of the mind, its sensorimotor modalities, and its environment. If the gears of your brain were the defining factor of your problem-solving ability, then those rare humans with IQs far outside the normal range of human intelligence would live lives far outside the scope of normal lives, would solve problems previously thought unsolvable, and would take over the world \u2014 just as some people fear smarter-than-human AI will do. In practice, geniuses with exceptional cognitive abilities usually live overwhelmingly banal lives, and very few of them accomplish anything of note. In Terman\u2019s landmark \u201cGenetic Studies of Genius\u201d, he notes that most of his exceptionally gifted subjects would pursue occupations \u201cas humble as those of policeman, seaman, typist and filing clerk\u201d. There are currently about seven million people with IQs higher than 150 \u2014 better cognitive ability than 99.9% of humanity \u2014 and mostly, these are not the people you read about in the news. Of the people who have actually attempted to take over the world, hardly any seem to have had an exceptional intelligence; anecdotally, Hitler was a high-school dropout, who failed to get into the Vienna Academy of Art \u2014 twice.\nPeople who do end up making breakthroughs on hard problems do so through a combination of circumstances, character, education, intelligence, and they make their breakthroughs through incremental improvement over the work of their predecessors. Success \u2014 expressed intelligence \u2014 is sufficient ability meeting a great problem at the right time. Most of these remarkable problem-solvers are not even that clever \u2014 their skills seem to be specialized in a given field and they typically do not display greater-than-average abilities outside of their own domain. Some people achieve more because they were better team players, or had more grit and work ethic, or greater imagination. Some just happened to have lived in the right context, to have the right conversation at the right time. Intelligence is fundamentally situational.\nOur environment puts a hard limit on our individual intelligence\nIntelligence is not a superpower; exceptional intelligence does not, on its own, confer you with proportionally exceptional power over your circumstances. However, it is a well-documented fact that raw cognitive ability \u2014 as measured by IQ, which may be debatable \u2014 correlates with social attainment for slices of the spectrum that are close to the mean. This was first evidenced in Terman\u2019s study, and later confirmed by others \u2014 for instance, an extensive 2006 metastudy by Strenze found a visible, if somewhat weak, correlation between IQ and socioeconomic success. So, a person with an IQ of 130 is statistically far more likely to succeed in navigating the problem of life than a person with an IQ of 70 \u2014 although this is never guaranteed at the individual level \u2014 but here\u2019s the thing: this correlation breaks down after a certain point. There is no evidence that a person with an IQ of 170 is in any way more likely to achieve a greater impact in their field than a person with an IQ of 130. In fact, many of the most impactful scientists tend to have had IQs in the 120s or 130s \u2014 Feynman reported 126, James Watson, co-discoverer of DNA, 124 \u2014 which is exactly the same range as legions of mediocre scientists. At the same time, of the roughly 50,000 humans alive today who have astounding IQs of 170 or higher, how many will solve any problem a tenth as significant as Professor Watson?\nWhy would the real-world utility of raw cognitive ability stall past a certain threshold? This points to a very intuitive fact: that high attainment requires sufficient cognitive ability, but that the current bottleneck to problem-solving, to expressed intelligence, is not latent cognitive ability itself. The bottleneck is our circumstances. Our environment, which determines how our intelligence manifests itself, puts a hard limit on what we can do with our brains \u2014 on how intelligent we can grow up to be, on how effectively we can leverage the intelligence that we develop, on what problems we can solve. All evidence points to the fact that our current environment, much like past environments over the previous 200,000 years of human history and prehistory, does not allow high-intelligence individuals to fully develop and utilize their cognitive potential. A high-potential human 10,000 years ago would have been raised in a low-complexity environment, likely speaking a single language with fewer than 5,000 words, would never have been taught to read or write, would have been exposed to a limited amount of knowledge and to few cognitive challenges. The situation is a bit better for most contemporary humans, but there is no indication that our environmental opportunities currently outpace our cognitive potential.\n\u201cI am, somehow, less interested in the weight and convolutions of Einstein\u2019s brain than in the near certainty that people of equal talent have lived and died in cotton fields and sweatshops.\u201d \u2014 Stephen Jay Gould\nA smart human raised in the jungle is but a hairless ape. Similarly, an AI with a superhuman brain, dropped into a human body in our modern world, would likely not develop greater capabilities than a smart contemporary human. If it could, then exceptionally high-IQ humans would already be displaying proportionally exceptional levels of personal attainment; they would achieve exceptional levels of control over their environment, and solve major outstanding problems\u2014 which they don\u2019t in practice.\nMost of our intelligence is not in our brain, it is externalized as our civilization\nIt\u2019s not just that our bodies, senses, and environment determine how much intelligence our brains can develop \u2014 crucially, our biological brains are just a small part of our whole intelligence. Cognitive prosthetics surround us, plugging into our brain and extending its problem-solving capabilities. Your smartphone. Your laptop. Google search. The cognitive tools your were gifted in school. Books. Other people. Mathematical notation. Programing. The most fundamental of all cognitive prosthetics is of course language itself \u2014 essentially an operating system for cognition, without which we couldn\u2019t think very far. These things are not merely knowledge to be fed to the brain and used by it, they are literally external cognitive processes, non-biological ways to run threads of thought and problem-solving algorithms \u2014 across time, space, and importantly, across individuality. These cognitive prosthetics, not our brains, are where most of our cognitive abilities reside.\nWe are our tools. An individual human is pretty much useless on its own \u2014 again, humans are just bipedal apes. It\u2019s a collective accumulation of knowledge and external systems over thousands of years \u2014 what we call \u201ccivilization\u201d \u2014 that has elevated us above our animal nature. When a scientist makes a breakthrough, the thought processes they are running in their brain are just a small part of the equation \u2014 the researcher offloads large extents of the problem-solving process to computers, to other researchers, to paper notes, to mathematical notation, etc. And they are only able to succeed because they are standing on the shoulder of giants \u2014 their own work is but one last subroutine in a problem-solving process that spans decades and thousands of individuals. Their own individual cognitive work may not be much more significant to the whole process than the work of a single transistor on a chip.\nAn individual brain cannot implement recursive intelligence augmentation\nAn overwhelming amount of evidence points to this simple fact: a single human brain, on its own, is not capable of designing a greater intelligence than itself. This is a purely empirical statement: out of billions of human brains that have come and gone, none has done so. Clearly, the intelligence of a single human, over a single lifetime, cannot design intelligence, or else, over billions of trials, it would have already occurred.\nHowever, these billions of brains, accumulating knowledge and developing external intelligent processes over thousand of years, implement a system \u2014 civilization \u2014 which may eventually lead to artificial brains with greater intelligence than that of a single human. It is civilization as a whole that will create superhuman AI, not you, nor me, nor any individual. A process involving countless humans, over timescales we can barely comprehend. A process involving far more externalized intelligence \u2014 books, computers, mathematics, science, the internet \u2014 than biological intelligence. On an individual level, we are but vectors of civilization, building upon previous work and passing on our findings. We are the momentary transistors on which the problem-solving algorithm of civilization runs.\nWill the superhuman AIs of the future, developed collectively over centuries, have the capability to develop AI greater than themselves? No, no more than any of us can. Answering \u201cyes\u201d would fly in the face of everything we know \u2014 again, remember that no human, nor any intelligent entity that we know of, has ever designed anything smarter than itself. What we do is, gradually, collectively, build external problem-solving systems that are greater than ourselves.\nHowever, future AIs, much like humans and the other intelligent systems we\u2019ve produced so far, will contribute to our civilization, and our civilization, in turn, will use them to keep expanding the capabilities of the AIs it produces. AI, in this sense, is no different than computers, or books, or language itself: it\u2019s a technology that empowers our civilization. The advent of superhuman AI will thus be no more of a singularity than the advent of computers, or books, or language. Civilization will develop AI, and just march on. Civilization will eventually transcend what we are now, much like it has transcended what we were 10,000 years ago. It\u2019s a gradual process, not a sudden shift.\nThe basic premise of intelligence explosion \u2014 that a \u201cseed AI\u201d will arise, with greater-than-human problem solving ability, leading to a sudden, recursive, runaway intelligence improvement loop \u2014 is false. Our problem-solving abilities (in particular, our ability to design AI) are already constantly improving, because these abilities do not reside primarily in our biological brains, but in our external, collective tools. The recursive loop has been in action for a long time, and the rise of \u201cbetter brains\u201d will not qualitatively affect it \u2014 no more than any previous intelligence-enhancing technology. Our brains themselves were never a significant bottleneck in the AI-design process.\nIn this case, you may ask, isn\u2019t civilization itself the runaway self-improving brain? Is our civilizational intelligence exploding? No. Crucially, the civilization-level intelligence-improving loop has only resulted in measurably linear progress in our problem-solving abilities over time. Not an explosion. But why? Wouldn\u2019t recursively improving X mathematically result in X growing exponentially? No \u2014 in short, because no complex real-world system can be modeled as `X(t + 1) = X(t) * a, a > 1`. No system exists in a vacuum, and especially not intelligence, nor human civilization.\nWhat we know about recursively self-improving systems\nWe don\u2019t have to speculate about whether an \u201cexplosion\u201d would happen the moment an intelligent system starts optimizing its own intelligence. As it happens, most systems are recursively self-improving. We\u2019re surrounded with them. So we know exactly how such systems behave \u2014 in a variety of contexts and over a variety of timescales. You are, yourself, a recursively self-improving system: educating yourself makes you smarter, in turn allowing you to educate yourself more efficiently. Likewise, human civilization is recursively self-improving, over a much longer timescale. Mechatronics is recursively self-improving \u2014 better manufacturing robots can manufacture better manufacturing robots. Military empires are recursively self-expanding \u2014 the larger your empire, the greater your military means to expand it further. Personal investing is recursively self-improving \u2014 the more money you have, the more money you can make. Examples abound.\nConsider, for instance, software. Writing software obviously empowers software-writing: first, we programmed compilers, that could perform \u201cautomated programming\u201d, then we used compilers to develop new languages implementing more powerful programming paradigms. We used these languages to develop advanced developer tools \u2014 debuggers, IDEs, linters, bug predictors. In the future, software will even write itself.\nAnd what is the end result of this recursively self-improving process? Can you do 2x more with your the software on your computer than you could last year? Will you be able to do 2x more next year? Arguably, the usefulness of software has been improving at a measurably linear pace, while we have invested exponential efforts into producing it. The number of software developers has been booming exponentially for decades, and the number of transistors on which we are running our software has been exploding as well, following Moore\u2019s law. Yet, our computers are only incrementally more useful to us than they were in 2012, or 2002, or 1992.\nBut why? Primarily, because the usefulness of software is fundamentally limited by the context of its application \u2014 much like intelligence is both defined and limited by the context in which it expresses itself. Software is just one cog in a bigger process \u2014 our economies, our lives \u2014 just like your brain is just one cog in a bigger process \u2014 human culture. This context puts a hard limit on the maximum potential usefulness of software, much like our environment puts a hard limit on how intelligent any individual can be \u2014 even if gifted with a superhuman brain.\nBeyond contextual hard limits, even if one part of a system has the ability to recursively self-improve, other parts of the system will inevitably start acting as bottlenecks. Antagonistic processes will arise in response to recursive self-improvement and squash it \u2014 in software, this would be resource consumption, feature creep, UX issues. When it comes to personal investing, your own rate of spending is one such antagonistic process \u2014 the more money you have, the more money you spend. When it comes to intelligence, inter-system communication arises as a brake on any improvement of underlying modules \u2014 a brain with smarter parts will have more trouble coordinating them; a society with smarter individuals will need to invest far more in networking and communication, etc. It is perhaps not a coincidence that very high-IQ people are more likely to suffer from certain mental illnesses. It is also perhaps not random happenstance that military empires of the past have ended up collapsing after surpassing a certain size. Exponential progress, meet exponential friction.\nOne specific example that is worth paying attention to is that of scientific progress, because it is conceptually very close to intelligence itself \u2014 science, as a problem-solving system, is very close to being a runaway superhuman AI. Science is, of course, a recursively self-improving system, because scientific progress results in the development of tools that empower science \u2014 whether lab hardware (e.g. quantum physics led to lasers, which enabled a wealth of new quantum physics experiments), conceptual tools (e.g. a new theorem, a new theory), cognitive tools (e.g. mathematical notation), software tools, communications protocols that enable scientists to better collaborate (e.g. the Internet)\u2026\nYet, modern scientific progress is measurably linear. I wrote about this phenomenon at length in a 2012 essay titled \u201cThe Singularity is not coming\u201d. We didn\u2019t make greater progress in physics over the 1950\u20132000 period than we did over 1900\u20131950 \u2014 we did, arguably, about as well. Mathematics is not advancing significantly faster today than it did in 1920. Medical science has been making linear progress on essentially all of its metrics, for decades. And this is despite us investing exponential efforts into science \u2014 the headcount of researchers doubles roughly once every 15 to 20 years, and these researchers are using exponentially faster computers to improve their productivity.\nHow comes? What bottlenecks and adversarial counter-reactions are slowing down recursive self-improvement in science? So many, I can\u2019t even count them. Here are a few. Importantly, every single one of them would also apply to recursively self-improving AIs.\nDoing science in a given field gets exponentially harder over time \u2014 the founders of the field reap most the low-hanging fruit, and achieving comparable impact later requires exponentially more effort. No researcher will ever achieve comparable progress in information theory as Shannon did in his 1948 paper.\nSharing and cooperation between researchers gets exponentially more difficult as a field grows larger. It gets increasingly harder to keep up with the firehose of new publications. Remember that a network with N nodes has N * (N - 1) / 2 edges.\nAs scientific knowledge expands, the time and effort that have to be invested in education and training grows, and the field of inquiry of individual researchers gets increasingly narrow.\nIn practice, system bottlenecks, diminishing returns, and adversarial reactions end up squashing recursive self-improvement in all of the recursive processes that surround us. Self-improvement does indeed lead to progress, but that progress tends to be linear, or at best, sigmoidal. Your first \u201cseed dollar\u201d invested will not typically lead to a \u201cwealth explosion\u201d; instead, a balance between investment returns and growing spending will usually lead to a roughly linear growth of your savings over time. And that\u2019s for a system that is orders of magnitude simpler than a self-improving mind.\nLikewise, the first superhuman AI will just be another step on a visibly linear ladder of progress, that we started climbing long ago.\nConclusions\nThe expansion of intelligence can only come from a co-evolution of brains (biological or digital), sensorimotor affordances, environment, and culture \u2014 not from merely tuning the gears of some brain in a jar, in isolation. Such a co-evolution has already been happening for eons, and will continue as intelligence moves to an increasingly digital substrate. No \u201cintelligence explosion\u201d will occur, as this process advances at a roughly linear pace.\nRemember:\nIntelligence is situational \u2014 there is no such thing as general intelligence. Your brain is one piece in a broader system which includes your body, your environment, other humans, and culture as a whole.\nNo system exists in a vacuum; any individual intelligence will always be both defined and limited by the context of its existence, by its environment. Currently, our environment, not our brain, is acting as the bottleneck to our intelligence.\nHuman intelligence is largely externalized, contained not in our brain but in our civilization. We are our tools \u2014 our brains are modules in a cognitive system much larger than ourselves. A system that is already self-improving, and has been for a long time.\nRecursively self-improving systems, because of contingent bottlenecks, diminishing returns, and counter-reactions arising from the broader context in which they exist, cannot achieve exponential progress in practice. Empirically, they tend to display linear or sigmoidal improvement. In particular, this is the case for scientific progress \u2014 science being possibly the closest system to a recursively self-improving AI that we can observe.\nRecursive intelligence expansion is already happening \u2014 at the level of our civilization. It will keep happening in the age of AI, and it progresses at a roughly linear pace.\n@fchollet, November 2017\nMarketing footnote: my book Deep Learning with Python has just been released.

Photo: Sean Rayford/Getty Images\nAs a child, being the son of a police officer was the coolest.\nMy father was my literal hero; he could do no wrong in my eyes. His cop car excited me, and I got a thrill every time I could check out his guns and gadgets. I wanted to believe that every person who wore the same uniform worked in and served their community fairly, just like him.\nThere wasn\u2019t a place I could visit in my small Alabama town where my dad didn\u2019t know multitudes of people. He\u2019s a likable guy with a charming smile and can talk to anyone, probably because he\u2019s already met them.\nNow that I\u2019m an adult, I\u2019m still incredibly proud of my dad. I see how seriously he takes his job. He\u2019s never lost the same persona I remember from my childhood. Something has changed all these years later, though \u2014 not him, but me. The seven-year-old\u2019s fantasy of what it meant to be a police officer began to fade away with every passing year.\nMy police officer father isn\u2019t enough to shield me from the harsh reality that we both live as Black men. He doesn\u2019t wear his occupation on his skin or his street clothes. When his Kevlar vest comes off, and he\u2019s at home with his family, he\u2019s Black first. Every time the police brutalize someone Black and it makes national news, I understand that he could easily wind up being the victim one day \u2014 for doing something as routine as going to the grocery store.\nMy close friends know what my dad does for a living. They regularly ask me how I feel about the police system and where I stand when it comes to police brutality. I\u2019m not undecided; I have no reason to straddle the fence. If I encountered the police right now, would undying loyalty to the badge spare me from getting beaten down in the middle of the street, or shot in the back, or killed?\nThe answer is no. The proof has existed for centuries now. It\u2019s glossed over in our history books, seen on video, and fought through protests and riots, still in 2020. So forgive me if I don\u2019t paint \u201cgoodness\u201d over the boys in blue with a broad stroke. I have no choice but to be cautious.\nIf I encountered the police right now, would undying loyalty to the badge spare me from getting beaten down in the middle of the street, or shot in the back, or killed?\nThe police have a critical and necessary job, but they are not messiahs. A badge and the authority to enforce the law don\u2019t gauge their morality. Violent, deadly police actions against unarmed Black people keep speaking the whole truth. I see myself, my family, and my friends in every news story about police brutality. While representation can be a truly powerful motivator, it can also serve as an overwhelming tool of fear for all the wrong reasons. A broken system continues its effort to break Black people, and that\u2019s every reason to look at police encounters with concern.\nThis threat influences how I move every single day. Being outdoors means I need a backup plan for all the what-ifs: What if the police show up where I am and point a gun at me? What if I get pulled over? What am I going to do to make sure I get home safely?\nAs Black people, we learn the following lessons early on:\nIf you get pulled over, don\u2019t move and keep your hands on the steering wheel. Only crack your window.\nNo matter how mad you are, always smile and be friendly. Anything less can cost you your life.\nCall someone and put them on speakerphone so they can hear what\u2019s going on.\nAt night, turn on your interior lights so other people can see you.\nNever leave your car.\nBeing Black means fearing a hostile police encounter and becoming a name in a never-ending loop of victims of police aggression and violence.\nKnowing our rights and standing up for ourselves shouldn\u2019t be a death penalty. It shouldn\u2019t be common for justice not to be served when the evidence paints the entire picture. I shouldn\u2019t have to hear excuses about how someone should have complied or be told to \u201cwait for the facts.\u201d\nI love my father, but his being a \u201cgood guy\u201d doesn\u2019t protect me in the broader world.

Everything was fine until it wasn\u2019t. A look of concern washed over our ultrasound tech\u2019s face. Then my wife\u2019s. Then mine. The tech calmly plays it off and tries to change the subject as we both see her stop for a moment and start typing something.\nA few minutes later, we were sent to the room where the doctor always came in to talk with us. Anxiety now started to pour in like a heavy mist. After a detailed conversation with the doctor, we had to come back in a week when the fetal medicine clinic made their routine visit.\nWithin 2 hours of our next appointment, we were told to go home, pack, and get ready to stay in the hospital for the foreseeable future. A normal pregnancy turned into one of panic, one that found itself in the less than 1 percentile and one that could force my wife into an emergency C-section and put both her and our baby girl at risk. There were serious complications and we were terrified of what that meant and how drastically our lives changed in that second. As a matter of fact, that entire day and the days that followed were a blur. Time stood still and then it moved in a way that was threatening to leave us in a tailspin.\nDespite everything that was happening, we both couldn\u2019t help but think about our jobs.\nWhat were our options? How did we navigate this? What does our leave look like? Are we 100% sure we even have leave?\nNot only was this a brand new situation for 2 newlyweds, but for our peer group in general. We were caught in a place where the odds of others close to us sharing this experience with us was slim to none at best. We had no choice but to talk to our jobs and let them know that what we were going through needed us to be present and have our undivided attention and it was scary.\nMy wife\u2019s job had a plan in place. It wasn\u2019t great, but it wasn\u2019t bad either because after all, it at least existed. Maternity leave? No problem. Sign here. Send these documents in. Focus on your child. My job was the same. Paternity leave? No problem. Sign here. Send these documents in. Focus on your family.\nWhen we stepped into the hospital, we were shocked to know that our entire floor was dedicated to the less than 1 percenters who were just like us \u2014 parents who were all going through similarly rough experiences. It was nearly 20\u201330 rooms that were constantly full. We talked with nurses and doctors about the comings and goings of the people there. We learned about that moms who came before us, some of which who had to leave their jobs and the dads whose companies couldn\u2019t be bothered to give them the space they needed or any kind of accommodations. They had no choice but to put their jobs first, over their family with no exceptions.\nAnd that\u2019s what bothered me and has since. Our jobs had something, but what about the numerous people whose jobs don\u2019t and they are forced to make impossible decisions? While there have been strides made for paid parental leave, it ultimately falls short. Only 21% of Americans even have access to paid family and medical leave in households where both parents work full time. There is no program on the national level and Americans are left to drown if they aren\u2019t lucky enough to work at a place that\u2019s either progressive in their policies or has had pressure to innovate and move away from antiquated ideals.\nIt was my privilege, being someone that was able to take paid leave, that made me angry and hurt for those who came before me or are in my current situation and have no choice but to be unavailable.\nAs a soon-to-be father, it bothers me even more that so few, including people with families, place so little value on the domestic role that fathers should have in their homes or in the hospital. So many employers have left their employees to their own devices \u2014 their apathy demanding that these parents, and largely fathers, figure it out or else.\nDuring this journey, my wife has needed me. She still does. There are countless men whose partners needed them and/or still do. With only 25% of companies even offering paid family leave of some kind, the math is there to show that millions of people are being denied the ability to be fully present and attentive to their families when the time calls for it whether for emergencies or bonding.\nFor fathers, they largely get left out of the idea of paternity leave, let alone paid paternity leave. Why? The stigma around men being the breadwinners, even in the toughest seasons of life. They\u2019re expected to make sacrifices and miss important moments in time because it\u2019s their perceived duty to provide at all costs with no help.\nIt was Alexis Ohanian\u2019s story around the birth of his daughter, Olympia, a few years ago and his advocating for paid parental leave that made me see how much work needs to be done here. I had no idea my wife and I would be staring down the barrel of the gun in a precarious circumstance in the same vein as well. I started to understand that fathers don\u2019t have the support they need yet to do their fatherly duties outside of work.\nWhat\u2019s even more revealing is that only 9% of jobs in the United States offer paid paternity leave to all male employees, and 76% of fathers are back to work within a week after the birth or adoption of a child.\nPerhaps values have been pushed into us by our own fathers and influences. Either way, men need more, whether it\u2019s for crisis or for quality time. The perception of fathers and their role in the household needs to continue to shift because fathers aren\u2019t being given the opportunity to prioritize their families first over the \u201cwork first\u201d mentality that negatively ripples throughout households.\nPaternity leave, fully paid and accounted for, allows fathers to take the full assumption of their position in their families. With so many men coming from split homes and dysfunctional families, unsure of how to conceptualize what parenting really requires, there needs to be adequate time to learn and apply practices and good habits without the stress of being let go or cutting off income being a part of that. It ultimately should start with a national paid family leave program, where every father has equitable access.\nAs of now, those who get to take extended leaves are disproportionately White, but we can change that. We need to create a unilateral experience that promotes men\u2019s devotion and engagement to their family, even over their work, regardless of class, race, status, and employment type.\nPaternity leave has more benefits than just job security. It grows relationships. It sets expectations and parental roles. It gives father\u2019s uninterrupted time to bond with their children, but also their wives and partners. It allows men to be proper support systems in critical moments and emergencies. Most importantly, it gives men time to explore what it means to truly be a father in all aspects and makes it an important piece of each day that doesn\u2019t have to find a place to fit in.\nParenting isn\u2019t something that should be left for the mothers to endure alone. This is why paid paternity leave is vital to the integrity of homes. When fathers aren\u2019t or can\u2019t be around, it leaves mothers by themselves to learn how to do everything. Part of that is because we assume that mothers just inherently know what to do. That\u2019s not true though and it\u2019s another perceived stigma we need to do away with. It\u2019s a learning experience that should always include both parents if possible. Fathers doing this alongside the mothers creates men who know how to be the caregivers they need to be and their children deserve.\nAnd as I ponder my own situation, I realize now more than ever how badly our culture and ideals need to shift around the parenting experience, from pregnancy to care.\nBetter homes will be fostered when men are encouraged more to be fathers that are more involved in the process from beginning to end.\nThat starts and will continue with paid paternity leave, as the status quo is challenged, and when paid family leave as a whole becomes an equitable, national right for everyone.", "comment_count": 6, "like_count": 356, "created_time": 1643071138579, "comment": [{"user_id": "94567619ae00", "comment_time": 1643071138579, "comment": "Thank you for sharing!"}, {"user_id": "545484f346cc", "comment_time": 1646796273931, "comment": "When a baby is born, fathers too have responsibilities, both as a husband and a co-parent.

It means that a relationship is more than surface level, transcending typical transactional friendships and coworking environments. It gives us the warm and fuzzies. It sounds good, but in reality, the term comes with many gray areas and usually encourages the complete and utter lack of professional boundaries and work/life expectations.\nFamily has found itself being used in the workplace to elicit an emotionally-charged reaction from someone looking to work somewhere that \u201ccares\u201d for them. In some cases, it does seem well-intentioned, and there are hiring managers and executives who mean it, but it\u2019s not 50/50. That\u2019d be assuming that companies that constantly sling the word around are truly employee-first. There are stories in the news every day that show us that that\u2019s not the case. I\u2019m sure you could find an example right now in your current work situation that would fly in the face of that.\nNow ask yourself these questions:\nHow often have you felt guilty for not working late for your \u201cfamily\u201d just to end up spending an unnecessary amount of extra hours for work that could have been finished the next day?\nHow often did you use that unlimited PTO because the company culture never allowed you to take a breath?\nHow often did you feel pressured to work when you were sick?\nHow often did you justify your pay to yourself despite working more than you should have with little reward to show for it?\nExactly.\nFamily is and will always be a strategic word. Communications teams sit in meetings to discuss what words can create certain emotional reactions, not because the company truly cares about the people on the other side of those words, but because their sole focus is retention and profit. They have to make people feel like they\u2019re a part of something and give them a reason to stay. In a world where everyone is looking for belonging, putting family in the company lexicon is marketing. It pulls all the right heartstrings for people who don\u2019t realize that it doesn\u2019t go much further than just that\u2013marketing.\nFamily doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re interested and concerned about your family. It\u2019s not about yours. It\u2019s not about your parents or your children. It\u2019s not about your pets or your hobbies. It\u2019s about the work and producing and little else. Retaining you means telling you that you\u2019re in this with them together just enough to keep you going full speed in your hamster wheel, thinking that prioritizing killing yourself is purposeful.\nOil and water don\u2019t mix.\nFamily and business don\u2019t mix either.\nIt\u2019s not because they can\u2019t for a short period of time. It\u2019s because each entity has different goals and different purposes. We can\u2019t drink oil and be nourished. We can\u2019t fry chicken in water. Businesses are looking to maintain and build upon their statuses and we\u2019re looking to take care of our homes and find stability. Those ventures don\u2019t align, and if they do, it won\u2019t be for long.\nWhat we have to remember is that business is truly business. Companies are looking to meet their bottom-line and make profits. They\u2019ll do it at your expense, and if they can\u2019t, they\u2019ll find someone to buy-in in your place.\nThey aren\u2019t your relatives. You can\u2019t depend on them when you have a sick child. You won\u2019t see them at Christmas. You don\u2019t plan vacations with them. They aren\u2019t your emotional, spiritual, or mental support system. They\u2019re a medium that you have to use to pay your bills and take care of your real family \u2014 the ones who actually need you and your full self, whether or not making money is at the center of it.\nThis isn\u2019t to demonize your place of work. It\u2019s to make you more aware of how much you\u2019re giving away to your job compared to your home. You\u2019ll make friends, and some of them may even become like family, but even then, you can\u2019t afford to start viewing your job as your second home. It\u2019s not. It should never be.\nThe real work/life balance isn\u2019t how far you can lean into the familial climate of your job.

They never saw a red cent. We talk about them like they\u2019re professionals, even though we clearly understand that student-athletes are maturing adults who still have so much life left to live. The reward for their efforts has been nonexistent.\nIn the last decade, we\u2019ve seen dramatic changes across the country in almost every single way that humans interact. The pandemic changed how we live. Meme stocks became the heists of the century. The name, image, and likeness talks surrounding collegiate athletes ramped up and were no longer fantastical \u201cwhat ifs\u201d in water cooler conversations.\nGovernor Newsom of California got the ball rolling for the Fair Pay to Play Act and states began to sign bills and executive orders allowing their student-athletes to benefit from NIL. California schools were looking to have the edge in recruiting, but states started passing laws and there was nothing California or the NCAA could do about it.\nAnd that\u2019s a good thing. After many failed attempts, there was absolutely nothing the NCAA could do to stand in the way of the snowball from rolling downhill.\nNow I know there are a litany of people who have taken up residence on the fence about whether this is a good thing or not. I can answer that for you. It is.\nHow many times have you watched a professional athlete fumble the bag, get in trouble, tarnish their name, image, and likeness, and followed that up with, \u201cWhat is their problem? Why can\u2019t they get it together?\u201d\nBut think about where that starts. If we agree that people are products of their environments, good or bad, why do we think that somehow that changes after they\u2019re given several millions to compete at a professional level with no real guidance or foundation to tell them how to maneuver through the world responsibly? That\u2019s where college should step in. It\u2019s the gateway to everyone else\u2019s career. Why shouldn\u2019t that apply to collegiate athletes as well?\nThis isn\u2019t to say that everyone who becomes a professional athlete was cut from an insecure background. What it does say is that it has been long overdue for schools to be involved in helping their athletes have a firm grasp on important things outside of 60 minutes or 9 innings.\nThese student-athletes need education on financial literacy, to know how to create, protect, and promote their brands, to learn the ins and outs of contracts and negotiations, and to challenge the way that they make choices and business decisions in their present and in their future.\nImagine the impact this will have on athletes who come from communities where they never had access. NIL will change \u201cI wish I could\u201d to \u201cI can\u201d and that\u2019s what matters most.\nAnd make no mistake, there will be players and coaches who fall short and there will be companies who do bad business. We\u2019ll hear about it. They\u2019ll make headlines. People will reconsider their support of NIL, but without the risks there is no reward. NIL will be providing thousands of college athletes with the resources to improve their quality of life and hopefully unlock new passions all while they sacrifice their bodies and manage their schooling.\nUniversities have made billions off of athletes, with very few of them, if any seeing a return on their investment from that. Yes, scholarships give these students who\u2019ve worked hard for their spots the chance to participate in team sports. What the NIL does is open the door for a new era of accountability, where the colleges that recruit these athletes have no choice but to be mindful of the athletic cultures they\u2019ve created, the people they\u2019ve hired in leadership and administration, and even more so the tools that they can offer on and off the field. Soon it won\u2019t just be about sports or sticking to them. It\u2019ll be about practical education they receive as much as the chance to make it to the next level if that applies.\nIt goes back to access, the most key ingredient to success next to knowing how to use it. NIL will expose which universities have bought in and which ones don\u2019t have a clue. As 247 Sports\u2019 Josh Pate says it \u2014 time will tell and money will expose everything.\n\nThis is a path to entrepreneurship that can\u2019t be understated. Not only is it going to help underserved athletes see that there can be reward for working hard at their craft, but it\u2019s going to emphasize extra value on their brand as they put their bodies on the line for mass consumption. Shannon Terry, entrepreneur and founder of several sports franchises including the new future sports powerhouse ON3 Sports, sees the entrepreneurial possibilities that NIL has for student athletes.\n\nRegardless of how you feel about what these athletes do with their money and endorsements, you should want them to succeed at this. You should want the parties and schools and people involved in the decision making process to work to get this right.\nYou can already see the benefits. Athletes are already starting their own brands and companies, selling NFTs, landing endorsement deals with companies, and making professional business moves that will lead them to completely rethink the way go through college and what they can do after it.\nThere\u2019s concern that the top tier athletes are the only ones who will be inking the biggest deals and capitalizing on their highest earning potential, but that\u2019s not necessarily true. Once again, everything revolves around one thing: access.\nSchools looking to recruit and retain top talent will have to change their strategy, offer more development, and nurture their current athletes or get swept away in a sea of other universities who will take advantage of these tools, their unique locations, traditions, and networks, and newfound opportunity for parity.\nPlaces like Auburn University, who berthed their new SPIRIT curriculums to support their athletes as they enter this new era, will thrive.\nThe tide is turning. NIL will be the movement that spearheads an entire overhaul of an old and antiquated \u201cwait until you\u2019re a professional\u201d mentality. There\u2019s a lot to hypothesize, a lot to go wrong, and so much more to go right. NIL will certainly change over time, but as for now, we should think of this as a win. It is. This has been long overdue. As the college sports landscape changes, amateurism should change with it and how we see it as a whole. NIL marks a new generation and a way of doing things.\nIn the meantime, don\u2019t get caught up in the bad, which will come. Mistakes will be made, but think of all the good this will do. We\u2019re one step closer to seeing athletes take even more control of their situations, and most importantly, their futures earlier than ever.\nIt\u2019s about time.", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 33, "created_time": 1625157548944, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Sports", "College Sports", "Equality", "NCAA", "Nil"]}, {"author": "Q U I N T E S S A", "post_id": "b65a5fd15211", "user_id": "b6945486a16e", "title": "Once Upon a Time, a Football Player Took a Knee", "content": "Racism + Sports\nOnce Upon a Time, a Football Player Took a Knee\nUnpacking the latest on NFL systemic racism\nA football player takes a knee on the NFL field| Photo Courtesy of Facing History\nOnce upon a time, a football player took a knee.\nHe didn\u2019t yell, he didn\u2019t scream.\nHe was calm and full of peace.\nBut the world chose not to hear him.\nAnd instead, a knee was later sunk into a black life.\nTurning up the volume on systemic racism, \u2014 more impolite than they could\u2019ve ever imagined.\nWhile HBCU\u2019s were the subject target of threats at the rise of Black History month, \u2014 the same day, \u2014 the NFL was being served on a target platter. On February 1, 2022, NFL Coach Brian Flores filed a class-action suit against the organization, in conjunction with the Miami Dolphins, Denver Broncos, and New York Giant organizations, respectively. Flores\u2019 suit against the team organizations alleges systemic racism in hiring practices.\nThe 58-page lawsuit comes almost a month after his firing as head coach from the Miami Dolphins and after what Flores referenced as his refusal to purposefully lose games for greater chances at better draft picks, accepting money for game losses, and tampering with a quarterback before free agency.\nFlores claims in the suit that his refusal was responded to with disdain treatment and labels of non-compliant and difficult to work with. Despite setting a record-breaking back-to-back winning season in 2020, and 2021, Flores was fired on January 10th.\nThe lawsuit also alleges that in 2019, in an effort to help with Dolphin\u2019s draft position, the Giants and the Broncos conducted \u201cbogus\u201d in-person interviews with him just to comply with the Rooney Rule. Named after the late Dan Rooney, chairman of the organization\u2019s Workplace Diversity Committee, the Rooney rule is an NFL policy that requires teams to interview minority candidates for head coaching and senior management opportunities.\nThough Flores\u2019 January 27th interview with the Giants certainly satisfied the rule, the New York Giants decided to hire Brian Daboll a day later. Flores also alleged a similar incident occurred when interviewing with the Denver Broncos in 2019. The Broncos would eventually decide to hire Vic Fangio for head coach shortly after.\nThe team organizations responded in separate statements on Tuesday.\n\u201cWe interviewed an impressive and diverse group of candidates. The fact of the matter is, Brian Flores was in the conversation to be our head coach until the eleventh hour. Ultimately, we hired the individual we felt was most qualified to be our next head coach.\u201d \u2014 The New York Giants\n\u201cThe implication that we acted in a manner inconsistent with the integrity of the game is incorrect.\u201d \u2014 The Miami Dolphins\n\u201cPages of detailed notes, analysis, and evaluations from our interview demonstrate the depth of our conversation and sincere interest in Mr. Flores as a head coaching candidate. Our process was thorough and fair to determine the most qualified candidate for our head coaching position.\u201d \u2014 The Denver Broncos\nWigdor Law LLP, the firm representing Flores stated that the coach hopes to \u201cshine a light on the racial injustices that take place inside the NFL.\u201d\nOn September 1, 2016, American quarterback Colin Kaepernick kneeled during the 49ers\u2019 final preseason game for the first time during the national anthem. Kaepernick cited his actions as a protest against racial injustices, police brutality, and systemic racism in a peaceful manner.\n\u201cI am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color.\u201d To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.\u201d\nKaepernick understood his actions would not sit right with a lot of people.\n\u201cI am not looking for approval. I have to stand up for people that are oppressed. If they take football away, my endorsements from me, I know that I stood up for what is right.\u201d\nTaking a backseat on his personal goals for greater injustices, Colin Kaepernick took a knee.\nBut they refused to hear him, though.\nThey instead, took away his chances to ever play the game again.\nKaepernick\u2019s activism has highlighted significant injustices in organizations such as the NFL. Though his initial support was slow to speak, his activism hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed or untouched. In response to accusations of being blackballed in the NFL, Kaepernick filed a lawsuit in October 2017, alleging that league owners colluded to keep him out of the organization. In February 2019, it was announced that Kaepernick had reached a confidential settlement with the NFL.\nKaepernick remains a free agent to this day.\nSuch responses and efforts to eradicate the racial injustices underscored in the NFL have only returned verbal and dare I say, symbolic. Efforts to address such injustices and systemic oppression in the NFL have only seemed to truly show up from those disproportionately impacted; \u2014 progressing from players to coaches, peeling back the racist layers, but sharing the same conviction of sacrificing personal goals for greater chances at attaining equality.\nSocial critics question whether Brian Flores can prove systemic racism exists in the NFL. And if so, how should the NFL deal with the big Black problem?\nI think the more important question is whether the NFL can continue to suggest that racial injustices in the NFL are a Black problem when it\u2019s really giving more of a whole white problem?\nBecause it may have been possible when Colin Kaepernick took a knee.\nBut Brian Flores has jumped off the porch; \u2014 possibly to cause hell.\nThe kind of hell we like to call: Good trouble.\nThe end?\nI think not.\nQUINTESSA is a Freelance Writer & Journalist|#WEOC member & moderator| Blacktivist|Writer & Editor for Cultured, WEOC, The Case for the 1619 Project, and AfroSapiophile Publications.", "comment_count": 19, "like_count": 1718, "created_time": 1643862878644, "comment": [{"user_id": "b6945486a16e", "comment_time": 1643862878644, "comment": "Thank you for sharing!"}, {"user_id": "1b333e803a59", "comment_time": 1643974546425, "comment": "I support Flores like I support Kaep.

Photo Courtesy of GQ\nSince the coming and rise of social media over a decade ago, celebrity private matters are rarely avoidable from the widespread subject of public attention. The assumption that celebrity figures have a responsibility to tend to the world\u2019s perception of them is perhaps far more distressing than anyone can imagine.\nThe idea that because we see the success, glamour, and effortlessness in celebrities, we somehow assume the right to see everything else too;\u2014 the right to tell them who they should be or what they should stand for in scenarios we ourselves have never faced.\nConvincing public opinion has become a chaotic smokescreen so cloudy only a few have overcome.\nLast week, Megan Thee Stallion became the resurfaced subject of controversy after her interview with Gayle King regarding the 2020 shooting incident that left Megan injured; \u2014 in more ways than one.\nOn July 12th, 2020 Megan The Stallion was reportedly shot in the Hollywood Hills by rapper Tory Lanez after attending a party hosted by Kylie Jenner, with him and her ex-bestfriend, Kelsey Nicole. On July 15th, 2020, Megan released a statement confirming she had suffered gunshot wounds and had undergone surgery to remove the bullets.\nThis statement countered a previous one made by Megan that she injured her foot on broken glass. A month later, Stallion confirmed that she was shot by Tory Lanez, stating: \u201cI didn\u2019t tell the police what happened immediately right there because I didn\u2019t want to die.\u201d Megan also stated that Lanez and his team offered her money to remain quiet.\nTory Lanez denied the allegations, largely addressing the incident on his album, Daystar. On the album, Lanez claimed an intimate relationship with Megan, while also stating that her team was trying to frame him.\nOn October 2nd, 2020, Megan Thee Stallion brought the painful incident to the stage in a powerful performance on SNL. Megan stood behind her claims. And in turn, the protect Black women movement stood behind Megan.\nAlmost one week after her SNL performance, on October 8th, 2020, Tory Lanez was charged with shooting Megan Thee Stallion.\nBetween several extensive attempts to reportedly launch smear campaigns and allegations against one another to prove their innocence, both Megan and Lanez have remained current on their positions regarding the incident. Megan remains assured that Lanez shot her, but denies an intimate relationship. Lanez denies shooting Megan but suggests an intimate relationship did occur.\nThe public statements, social media messages, and interviews have left the public opinion with access and discourse into the lives of a sensitive, personal matter. Is Megan Thee Stallion telling the truth? Did Tory Lanez shoot Megan? If not, then who?\nThe most recent public interview further complicates what most suggest should have been a private matter handled in the court of law.\nOn April 25th, Megan Thee Stallion sat down with Gayle King to discuss her experience around the 2020 incident:\n\u201cSo I get out of the car, and it\u2019s like everything happens so fast. And all I hear is this man screaming. And he said, \u2018Dance, b \u2014 h.\u2019 And he started shooting.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m just like, Oh my God. And I was so scared.\u201d\n\u201cThe adrenaline is pumping so hard \u2014 I\u2019m not sure if he hit me. I feel it, but I don\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening.\u201d\nDuring the interview, Megan also denied allegations again of an intimate relationship, citing the involvement as, \u201cclose friends who bonded over the deaths of their mothers.\u201d\nMegan was criticized for major inconsistencies in her telling of the incident and accused of lying about her relationship with Lanez. The interview resurfaced old conflicting feelings about which side the public opinion should stand on. Some opinions viewed the interview as Megan\u2019s \u201cdesperate attempt\u201d to convince the public of her innocence. Others contend that Megan wanted the opportunity to respond to allegations that seem to protect Lanez.\nWhat I saw is Megan needing to remind the public that she is: the victim.\nMegan\u2019s interview with Gayle was largely described as \u201ccringe\u201d and \u201ca big mistake\u201d that could potentially affect her case in the upcoming trial. For some, the interview seemingly confirmed their hope that Tory Lanez didn\u2019t shoot Megan. For others, the interview seemingly confirmed the belief that he did. For me, the interview confirmed so much more.\nIrrespective of public opinion, Megan was injured beyond measure in and by this incident. After statements, proof of injury, and interviews, public opinion somehow still finds it difficult to confirm or accept this. Public opinion also seems to find it difficult to decide whether to support Megan in a time of deep vulnerability; \u2014 leaving an indecisive stance on whether Megan Thee Stallion deserves protection. What is even more unfortunate is that the decision to do so has been wavered by the controversial smokescreens of public opinions.\nHowever, one thing is clear: Megan Thee Stallion is, unfortunately, trying to convince the jury of public opinion in ways she shouldn\u2019t.\nAll because more than anything, Megan desperately wants what most injured Black women need just as much, and maybe even more than protection.\nAnd that is to be believed.\nInjury to the Black female body is oftentimes heavier than we are willing to confirm or validate. If substantiating our injury was a dissertation, it\u2019d prove a long-form essay many times over. The more inconceivable it has become to believe Black women, the more extreme the lengths to convince.\nWhile the lengths to be believed may have been unnecessary or redundant, the urgency speaks to a more important need in the Black female community. One that is often left out of vulnerable, but truthful moments such as these.\nThe shooting trial is set for September 14th. Lanez has pleaded not guilty to the charges. The idea is that the incident deserves a rightful day in court and it\u2019s even fair to say that Megan is to be believed until proven otherwise.\nUnfortunately, a more unavoidable controversial trial just had to occur first. One where private matters are discussed publicly and speculation and opinion triumph over truth. And it just may potentially cost Stallion in getting justice or the incident from being brought to the truthful light. I am no Sherlock Holmes or private eye, nor am I even witness enough to assure anything regarding the incident.\nBut of one thing I am certain: No one really wins in the trial of public opinion.\nWhat I can assure you, \u2014 irrespective of the outcome, \u2014 is that no one ever lost a damn thing from protecting Black women.\nMore importantly, \u2014 it costs absolutely nothing to believe us either.\nQUINTESSA is a Freelance Writer & Journalist|#WEOC member & moderator| Blacktivist|Writer & Editor for Cultured, WEOC, The Case for the 1619 Project, and AfroSapiophile Publications | Bylines in GEN, Momentum, and midnight & indigo.", "comment_count": 2, "like_count": 290, "created_time": 1651272597474, "comment": [{"user_id": "b6945486a16e", "comment_time": 1651272597474, "comment": "Thank you for sharing!"}, {"user_id": "37c535e838f0", "comment_time": 1651591030086, "comment": "Thank you for another thought provoking piece.

During the 1813 US war with Great Britain, Pickersgill was commissioned to make two flags; \u2014 one 30 X 42 feet and the other, 17 X 25 feet. A task this large would undoubtedly require the capability and labor of more than one person.\nWith the already assistance of her daughter Caroline and two nieces, Eliza and Margaret Young, Pickersgill enlisted the help of a 13-year old Grace Wisher and one additional unnamed African American woman, who was unmentioned for centuries, would help to make history; \u2014 literally.\nGrace Wisher was an African American indentured servant tasked with helping to create what would become the US flag. However, Mary Pickersgill is who would widely garner fame and recognition for their contribution. Much of Grace Wisher and the unnamed woman\u2019s life before, during, and after is unknown as the lives and contributions of African Americans have historically been deemed unimportant.\nHowever, we have one of their names in the meantime. A name, Black women, and the American flag. Had it not been for the deep span of a Black woman, our so beloved flag may not have been possible within the time-sensitive deadline\u2026or at all.\nThe home to Mary Pickersgill, where the flag was created, is now a museum called the Star-Spangled Banner Flag House. The likeness of Grace Wisher, while unknown is reflected as a trace-lined ghost figure in the 1962 Mackall painting. The uncertainty of Grace Wisher\u2019s appearance is unknown, but her presence is tangible.\nJust look at the flag.\nThe lesser-known story of Grace Wisher and the unnamed African American woman is a deeply rooted testament to the kind of hidden history that if continued, will become too lost to salvage.\nWe hope one day we will be able to give a name to the additional unnamed Black woman who contributed to creating the flag and countless others who\u2019ve also contributed to the continued legacy of American society.\nBlack girls deserve the world too, and everything in it.\nAnd if this Women\u2019s History Month has given me anything it is that I am no longer allowed to believe any different.\n1942 photograph by Howard Liberman. Courtesy of the Library of Congress\nThere is something rare the flag did get painfully right after all these years. The US flag has become a broken, misplaced symbol; \u2014 challenging the supposed notions of the American patriotical make-up the more we recover our hidden history.\nSo much of America was built on the labor and bodies of African Americans. More specifically, Black women are falling absent from the widespread American narrative.\nMuch like the flag and America, the journey through Black womanhood has left me to continuously challenge the intentionality of how we\u2019re taught to perceive American values.\nTo the Grace Wishers and unnamed, but deserving Black women of the world: They may take the deep span of a Black woman out of the flag; \u2014 out of the American narrative, \u2014 but they can\u2019t take the flag (America) from the deep span of a Black woman.\nClaim this world now and beyond.\nAfter all, it is ours, too.\nLiterally.\nQUINTESSA is a Freelance Writer & Journalist|#WEOC member & moderator| Blacktivist|Writer & Editor for Cultured, WEOC, The Case for the 1619 Project, and AfroSapiophile Publications | Bylines in GEN, Momentum, and midnight & indigo.", "comment_count": 3, "like_count": 451, "created_time": 1647384940022, "comment": [{"user_id": "b6945486a16e", "comment_time": 1647384940022, "comment": "Thank you for sharing!"}, {"user_id": "28a8d213e957", "comment_time": 1648759268703, "comment": "Thank you Quintessa for shedding the light on just one of our many accomplishments banished from HIS-Story.

When I liberate others, I liberate myself.\u201d\nFannie Lou Hamer, born October 6, 1917, was an American voting and women\u2019s civil rights activist from Montgomery County, Mississippi. Hamer was the last of about 20 siblings, granddaughter of slaves, and child of family sharecroppers, \u2014 a position not too far from slavery.\nHamer picked cotton with her family from the early age of six and by the age of 13, she would grow to pick a daily average of at least 200 pounds of cotton, all while battling polio. During this time, Hamer developed a strong interconnection with reading and interpreting the bible.\nHamer\u2019s civil rights peer, Lawerence Guyot later said of Hamer\u2019s ability to connect: \u201cthe biblical exhortations for liberation and [the struggle for civil rights] any time that she wanted to and move in and out to any frames of reference.\u201d\nIn her early power, Hamer found a way to bridge literacy and liberation on the road to activism and freedom.\nAfter her marriage to Perry, \u201cPap\u201d Hamer in 1945 and adopting children after being subjected to a hysterectomy without her consent, (during a tumor surgery removal), Hamer became deeply involved in the civil rights movement. Her interest first begin when she heard local leaders speak at the annual Regional Council of Negro Leadership, (RCNL) held in Mound Bayou, Mississippi.\nHamer\u2019s activism was never without the subject of racist attacks and denial of equal rights. In August 1962, Hamer attempted to vote but was denied after failing a literacy test. Hamer\u2019s attempt to vote for the first time cost her a job and a few days later while staying with a friend, Hamer was shot at 15 times in a racist drive-by shooting.\nA year later, after a third attempt, Hamer passed her literacy test and became a registered voter in Mississippi. However, Hamer would come to find later that if anything, her registration was more of an \u201cimplied power.\u201d\nIn the fall of 1963, after becoming a registered voter, Hamer was met with another obstacle when she tried to vote. She discovered that her county also required two poll tax receipts in addition to proof of registration.\nThis requirement interestingly emerged in most former Confederate states after the right to vote was first granted to all races in the 1870 ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\nThough Hamer later paid and acquired the poll tax receipts, these disproportionate laws demonstrate the acts of oppressive intimidation used against African Americans.\nAfter such incidents, Hamer became more involved in the civil rights organizations such as the Southern Christian Leadership Conferences (SCLC), and Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), where she became a field secretary for voter registration and welfare programs.\nIn her SNCC role, Hamer traveled throughout the south to obtain federal resources for poverty-stricken Black families and attempted to register more Black voters in Mississippi. Such attempts left Hamer to face similar incidents as she did when she tried to register herself. Some similar, some worse.\nIn 1963, while traveling to a conference in South Carolina, Hamer was jailed along with other activists, during a stop in Winona, Mississippi. Once in jail, Hamer was the subject of police brutality and sexual assault by police officers. When Hamer attempted to resist, she was subjected to a beating nearly fatal.\nAfter her release in June 1963, it would take Hamer over a month to recuperate. The incident left Hamer with significant physical and psychological damages, such as a blood clot over her left eye and permanent kidney damage. However, Hamer returned later in 1963 to help organize voter registration drives, such as the 1963 Freedom Ballot and the Freedom Summer initiative.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been beaten until my body was as hard as metal. But I will not stop.\u201d\nIn an effort to combat racist attempts at silencing Black votes in her hometown, Hamer helped create the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party in 1964. The organization was also established to ensure a party for those who supported the movement of dismantling exploitation and discrimination against minorities.\nAll of this is on account we want to register, to become first-class citizens, and if the Freedom Democratic Party is not seated now, I question America. Is this America, the land of the free and the home of the brave, where we have to sleep with our telephones off the hooks because our lives are threatened daily because we want to live as decent human beings in America?\nHamer possessed a prophetic vernacular that deeply resonated with her co-activists, the movement, and the south. Her style of speaking built bridges amongst various colleges, organizations, and institutions. Hamer\u2019s speeches were built with such confidence and biblical knowledge that most didn\u2019t think would be possible for someone without a full education. Yet, the way of her words captured Black feelings and experiences irrespective of their continued denial in America.\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t speak out ain\u2019t nobody going to speak out for you.\u201d\nFannie Lou Hamer continued to travel throughout the world speaking on various platforms; \u2014 gaining a trusted reputation so strong that it perhaps persuaded her unsuccessful run at U.S. Senate in 1964, steering the Freedom Farm Cooperative (FFC) in 1969, an initiative to help advance Black economic power, partnering with the National Council of Negro Women (NCNW), and co-founding the National Women\u2019s Political Caucus in 1971.\nBy 1975 and after the FFC disbanded due to lack of funding, Hamer\u2019s health began to decline. Hamer was hospitalized often in later years due to severe exhaustion and suffered many episodes with nervous breakdowns.\nHamer died on this day, 45 years ago, at the age of 59. Hamer, unfortunately, died poor, sick, and tired. Her tombstone is engraved with one of her famous quotes:\n\u201cI am sick and tired of being sick and tired.\u201d\nThough Hamer\u2019s involvement in the Civil Rights Movement often left her in harm\u2019s way and unfortunately in poor health, she did not waver in her fight for voting rights, women\u2019s rights, and racial equality. Her spirit was self-assertive but humble, her voice petitioning and powerful, her actions while all-inclusive, were never compromising.\nWith every block against her, Hamer still had the power to build a bridge.\nTo this present day, the Black woman\u2019s history maintains a diamond in the rough, but complex, and often times unsaying narrative all too hidden to give praise and too intricate to unravel. In America, the Black woman stands as an invaluable bridge America has utilized without recognition or accreditation.\nFannie Lou Hamer once said before she died: \u201cNever to forget where we came from and always praise the bridges that carried us over.\u201d\nAnd that is what my strongest conviction represents about Black women. In my own depth, I have found Black women to be a bridge; \u2014 giving America life to connect and cross many times over.\nIn some way, we\u2019ve all come from the deep span of a Black woman.\nAnd perhaps America\u2019s biggest problem is that they\u2019ve built too many walls against us and not enough bridges.\nQUINTESSA is a Freelance Writer & Journalist|#WEOC member & moderator| Blacktivist|Writer & Editor for Cultured, WEOC, The Case for the 1619 Project, and AfroSapiophile Publications | Bylines in GEN, Momentum, and midnight & indigo.", "comment_count": 6, "like_count": 515, "created_time": 1647210477265, "comment": [{"user_id": "b6945486a16e", "comment_time": 1647210477265, "comment": "Thank you for sharing!"}, {"user_id": "66289c111f63", "comment_time": 1647587465596, "comment": "As a Mississippian, I love Fannie Lou Hamer\u2764\ufe0f.

Now in its sixth year, the competition was created to reward excellence in avian photography and to draw attention to the importance of bird conservation through a partnership with Birds on the Brink.\nThis year\u2019s finalists are notable for their range, not just in the diversity of species that are captured, but in the differences in tone \u2014 from the humorous to the heartwarming to the macabre \u2014 and style. But each photo, in its own way, provides a brief but captivating glimpse of a bird\u2019s character and tells a story about our wonderful avian friends in all their variety and individuality.\n\u201cAmerican Oystercatcher,\u201d by James Wilcox\n\nMy favorite time of year is when the American Oystercatcher chicks hatch. I love getting to the beach at sunrise to watch and photograph family interactions. This young oystercatcher is old enough to forage but still relies on its parents for food because its beak hasn\u2019t developed the strength to open the shells of molluscs and crustaceans. This shot was taken in between waves, with the wet sand providing a bit of uplighting.\n\u201cSwallow,\u201d by David White\n\nSwallows have to be one of my favorite birds, and my entire family await their return in spring with nervous excitement. Will they arrive this year\u2026? Then there\u2019s the joy of that flash of steely blue as they return to the same stable on the farm. The one where they nested last year, and many years before that. This photo was taken from inside the building, using a remote trigger to fire the camera, which was situated at a safe distance just outside the window. The aim was to time the image-capture to coincide with the Swallow flying through the window and I am proud to have achieved my goal.\n\u201cShags,\u201d by G\u00e1bor Li\n\nLast summer, while on a family holiday in Croatia, I spent time photographing Shags. One of my goals was to take a photo of them underwater, but it was a lot harder than I first thought. Although they didn\u2019t care about me when they were on land, they were much more cautious when they were underwater. I waited in the water for hours, next to the rock where they were roosting and from which I assumed they would jump and submerge. Eventually my persistence paid o\ufb00: encouraged to dive by a nearby swimmer, one of the shags jumped into the water in front of me. I followed the bird under the water and took a few pictures of it almost blindly. My favorite thing about this image is that you can see the sparkly spot lit by the setting sun where the bird submerged.\n\u201cEurasian nuthatch,\u201d by Mark Williams\n\nThis Nuthatch was photographed in my garden using rear- curtain flash synchronization. I attract birds to my garden using feeders and peanuts are the food that Nuthatches cannot resist. The timing and method of capture were crucial to the success of this image. The initial exposure captured the movement of the bird while the flash, fired at the end of the exposure, freezes the bird in flight.\n\u201cBlack-tailed godwits,\u201d by Anupam Chakraborty\n\nHere we see two Black-tailed Godwits engaged in a fierce territorial battle, the location for this being an area of prime habitat in India\u2019s beautiful Manglajodi wetland. Why were they fighting? As they are seasonal migratory visitors to my country, and don\u2019t nest here, the fight obviously had nothing to do with establishing and protecting breeding territories. Instead, each bird was fighting to maintain its predominance over feeding grounds and trying to fend o\ufb00 rivals who would compete for the same food. Captured at the moment of contact, both godwits were attacking each other with their long beaks and gangly legs.\n\u201cSquacco heron,\u201d by Aguti Antonio\n\nSquacco Herons are migrant summer visitors to Italy and are found on well-vegetated ponds and wetlands, habitats that satisfy their dietary requirement for fish and amphibians. Although inclined to stand motionless for extended periods of time while looking for prey, they are capable of bursts of activity when the need arises. Such was the case with this individual and, captured in flight, it resembles a goalkeeper trying to make the \u2018save\u2019 of his life.\n\u201cGreat cormorant,\u201d by Tzahi Finkelstein\n\nI took this photograph of a fishing cormorant on a lake that was a 30 minute drive from home. Due to Covid19 restrictions in 2020, I had a lot of time on my hands and I went to this spot almost every day. Eventually persistence paid o\ufb00 and I was able to get this close-up, detailed image. Although the lake had up to15 cormorants feeding on it, photographing them was a matter of luck because you never knew where they might appear next, or whether they would have a fish in their beaks. After I took this photo, I never saw another one hunting in this spot again.\n\u201cBlack-crowned night-heron,\u201d by Daphne Wong\n\nAs night falls, Hong Kong\u2019s Victoria Harbor is brightly lit by billboard lights and street lamps. Here, a Black- crowned Night-heron has found a fishing perch on the harborfront. Used to the presence of humans, its red eyes stay fixated on the streetlight-lit water, looking for its next meal. I was out for a walk when I noticed the bird next to a pier on the harborfront, I made my way down to the water by hopping from rock to rock, and tried to get as low as possible to frame the bird against the bokeh created by the city lights.\n\u201cHooded crane,\u201d by Taku Ono\n\nWhen I arrived at a well-known wintering haunt of Hooded Cranes in Japan it was disappointingly overcast. And what\u2019s more I was about to go home. However, I realized that an area of the clouds was gradually dissipating as the sun rose, and I decided to stay a while \u2014 just in case. Almost miraculously, a streak of sunlight shone through and highlighted a small group of flying cranes. I thanked the cranes, beloved by Japanese people as \u201cthe bird of\nhappiness,\u201d for bringing me this good luck!\n\u201cEmperor penguins,\u201d by Thomas Vijayan\n\nThere is a reason for the timing of Emperor Penguins\u2019 hatching. By December, when the Antarctic weather has warmed somewhat, the ice the penguins occupy begins to break up, bringing open waters closer to the nesting sites. To take this image, I was lying flat on the ground. I did this because objects lower than penguin height are less intimidating to the birds. Consequently, they spent plenty of time beside me, meaning I could capture some beautiful shots. On this particular trip, I walked an average of eight hours each day in search of a perfect image.\n\u201cSouthern giant petrel,\u201d by Eirik Gr\u00f8nnings\u00e6ter\n\nSouthern Giant Petrels happily scavenge on dead seals or penguins or any other dead animal. Generally, they are opportunistic birds although they will sometimes also kill the birds themselves \u2014 even adult King Penguin, the carcass in this picture. The petrels are not afraid of people and so I carefully placed my camera inside the carcass of the penguin and waited for the bird to start eating. When it comes to food and feeding, Southern Giant Petrels are possessive birds, and this one is stretching its wings to ward o\ufb00 other petrels in the neighborhood.\n\u201cMute swan,\u201d by Diana Schmies\n\nMute Swans typically don\u2019t breed until they are at least three years old. But it is not uncommon for elements of courtship behavior to be seen earlier, as happened with this couple. Apparently not concerned by the age difference, this adult male was intent on wooing an immature female, and his interest appeared to be reciprocated. Classic courtship rituals were performed, like raising the necks and turning their heads sideways while keeping their breasts pressed against each other. Even though photographing these displaying swans on a misty morning required planning, a little luck was also needed when it came to the birds aligning parallel to my camera.\n\u201cGreat grey owl,\u201d by Scott Suriano\n\nWhile exploring the Northwoods of Minnesota, I found myself caught in a sudden heavy snow squall. Thinking that this weather episode might deter the Great Grey Owls from hunting, I considered packing it up and calling it a day. To my surprise, however, this particular owl took to the skies and began scanning the meadow for its next meal. With a sudden and acrobatic downward turn, it sliced through the heavy white flakes and crashed head first into the snow-blanketed field below. Within moments, I watched as it launched o\ufb00 into the distance with its freshly caught vole. It was a great reminder that to be successful you have to sometimes fully commit and dive in head first into the unknown.\n\u201cLong-tailed tit,\u201d by Irene Waring\n\nTaken at Lake Kussharo, this image shows a northern race Long- tailed Tit drinking in a most unusual fashion \u2014 it was taking water that was dripping from icicles hanging from tree branches near the shore. The sun had begun to melt the surface of the icicles, giving the birds access to water in the freezing conditions. Some birds clung to the branches, or the icicle itself, reaching out to drink. Others, however, flew in and hovered, taking droplets from the end. It was fascinating to watch and difficult to photograph, requiring a long lens used at an awkward upward angle.\n\u201cWhite-tailed sea-eagle,\u201d by Fahad Alenezi\n\nIn winter, food for most animals is in short supply in northern latitudes and many species, including this Red Fox, take greater risks than they would normally do to survive. In this photo a particularly bold fox has ventured close to an area where eagles were feeding. One White- tailed Sea-eagle took exception to the incursion and gave the fox what looks like a good slap with its wings. That\u2019s an encounter I imagine the fox will never forget.\n\u201cGreat cormorant,\u201d by Irma Szabo\n\nUntil I took this photo I must admit that Cormorants weren\u2019t my favorite birds. They are good at fishing, which doesn\u2019t always make them welcome at fish ponds in my country. However, in winter 2020 Cormorants were present in front of a bird hide I was using on several occasions, and I had nothing else to photograph. I gradually came to realize they are actually rather pretty birds, especially in breeding plumage with beautiful green eyes and shiny, dark green feathers. Sometimes they came very close, so I decided to take a portrait. I managed to capture this special moment when a Cormorant was just about to swallow its prey and the fish seemed to be flying into its beak.\n\u201cBlack-and-white warbler,\u201d by Raymond Hennessy\n\nBacklit by dawn light, the breath of this Black-and-White Warbler shows the subtle colors of the rainbow as it drifts o\ufb00 in the cold morning air. I noticed a small shaft of sunlight shining in the forest in an area frequented by\nthis warbler. With an image in mind, I devoted time to my quest, in the hope the bird might land in the right spot. When it did and it sang I was so happy!\n\u201cTufted duck,\u201d by Brad James\n\nIt\u2019s always a pleasure when you are able to capture both male and female of the same species in one image. I often find it tricky with waterfowl as they tend to overlap in some way. Consequently, I was very pleased when this scene lined up perfectly, with the drake framed and referenced by the out of focus duck in the background. To obtain this image I lay motionless on the edge of the pond, practically at water level.\n\u201cEurasian jackdaw,\u201d by Amanda Cook\n\nIt was an enchanting morning in May and I felt as though this Jackdaw and Fallow Deer were part of some childhood fairytale with the bird whispering a secret to the deer. In reality, the narrative was more ordinary and the Jackdaw was pinching hair from the deer\u2019s back to use in nest building. I often go into Bushy Park at dawn and on this occasion it was wonderful to capture the uninhibited and natural interaction between these two creatures.\n\u201cMute swan,\u201d by Andy Parkinson\n\nOver the years I have developed a bond of trust with a group of Mute Swans and on this occasion it paid dividends. This trusting relationship allowed me to capture this most intimate perspective: an infant cygnet resting its head peacefully on its sleeping mother. The female swan trusted me implicitly to stand this close and my accepted presence caused her not the slightest concern.\n\u201cMallard duck,\u201d by Zden\u011bk Jakl\n\nI took the photograph on a pond in a beautiful park in a quiet part of the city of Prague. As a family of Mallard ducklings swam past me, one of them began to chase a flying fly. It highlighted the fact that the instinct to feed is a powerful force even in the young, but of course the behavior itself was comical from a human perspective. Regardless of how you view what\u2019s going on, it certainly makes for an interesting photograph and a moment in time\nin a duckling\u2019s life captured for posterity.\n\u201cEuropean shag,\u201d by Brian Matthews\n\nIs there any food left? In this image, a hungry juvenile Shag literally dives down its mother throat for more fish rather than waiting for it to be fully regurgitated. It was taken on the Farne Islands, one of the most accessible \u2018Pu\ufb03n Islands\u2019 in the UK. A short boat trip from Seahouses in Northumberland drops you into another world of Pu\ufb03ns, Guillemots and ravenous Shags. Spending time with this family I managed to get some great behavioural shots. The Farne Islands aren\u2019t just about Pu\ufb03ns!\n\u201cHamerkop,\u201d by Daniel Zhang\n\nThis photo was taken in Zimanga Private Reserve, South Africa during my summer holiday. I was on a photography trip with my father. Although the toad appeared to be jumping into the hamerkop\u2019s mouth, in reality the bird was throwing its prey into the air in order to kill it. The toad was also dabbed onto the ground several times by the bird\u2019s beak. I felt very excited to have taken this shot.\n\u201cRed-crowned crane,\u201d by Li Ying Lou\n\nRed-crowned Crane pairs are faithful to one another throughout the year, and even during the winter months they engage in behavior designed to strengthen the bond. Birds perform dual honking rituals and an elaborate dance, and this is much appreciated by photographers who make the pilgrimage to see them in Japan. In order to capture the mood and convey a sense of the occasion to those looking at this photograph, I rushed to the photographic site at dawn. On my eighth attempt, I finally did photographic justice to the calling birds, with their breath vaporized by the cold air.\n\u201cGrey herons,\u201d by Terry Whittaker\n\nNowadays, Amsterdam\u2019s Grey Herons are celebrity scavengers and have become part of the scenery and a tourist attraction in their own right. Given their predilection for fish, it is hardly surprising that their antics and interactions are most in evidence when the market fishmonger stalls are closing. As they wait, the herons pick through the skips for scraps discarded during the day. Altercations are common as a dozen or so Grey Herons compete for the slim pickings on o\ufb00er.\n\u201cRed-billed oxpecker,\u201d by Daniela Anger\n\nIn the South Luangwa National Park you can watch a Hippo colony from a water-level hide. In addition to their human admirers, the water-loving mammals also receive a lot of attention from the local Red-billed Oxpeckers who seek a close encounter for more practical reasons. The birds and the Hippos have evolved a symbiotic relationship: the oxpeckers feed on external parasites and the Hippos benefit from the hygienic makeover. This image shows two oxpeckers sitting on a very relaxed Hippo: All parties seem entirely comfortable with the relationship.\n\u201cGentoo penguin,\u201d by Tom Schandy\n\nGentoo Penguins began surfing long before the first humans latched on to this craze. This image was taken at Carcass Island on the Falkland Islands, where the birds have no option but to surf if they want to get ashore. If the waves are a decent size, you can see the birds ride or surf on the top of them. It is a thrilling behavior to watch, and a rewarding one to capture photographically.\n\u201cSouthern rockhopper penguin,\u201d by Mark Sisson\n\nSouthern Rockhopper Penguins are among the most resilient birds I have spent any time with and watching their exploits, as they return from fishing expeditions to take over nesting duties, is alarming and awe-inspiring in equal measure. On this particular evening at one of their colonies in the Falkland islands, I had tentatively made my way down cli\ufb00s whose ascent and descent the birds made look so easy, and awaited the returning birds. I knew that preening was always the first priority on reaching the safety of land and given the orientation of the site that a silhouette image might be possible. I stopped-down my aperture to help highlight the subtle lens flare on this bird as it stood on a rock. As the penguin bent over in the course of preening, it seemed as if he was bowing to the sun itself.\n\u201cFiery-throated Hummingbird,\u201d by Gail Bisson\n\nWe stopped for lunch at a lodge in Costa Rica, one whose restaurant had multiple hummingbird feeders located throughout the property. The feeders, which are filled with sugary water, attract more than just hummingbirds and are also a magnet for insects. On this particular occasion, a Fiery-throated Hummingbird was resting on a perch a few feet away from the feeders when a wasp approached and landed on him. Disconcerted by the interest shown by the insect, the brief encounter generated a lot of chattering from the Fiery-throated Hummingbird but eventually both flew o\ufb00 unharmed.\n\u201cBar-Tailed Godwit,\u201d by Mario Suarez Porras\n\nThis image shows a Bar-tailed Godwit, photographed in the late evening on my local beach at Gij\u00f3n in northern Spain. Because it was really dark I was able to crawl towards the godwit without causing any disturbance. This beach is a good place for migrant shorebirds, particularly in autumn, and they always provide excellent photographic opportunities. The wet sand framing the godwit looks like it is on fire.\n\u201cAtlantic pu\ufb03n,\u201d by \u00d8yvind Pedersen\n\nThis photo was taken on the bird cli\ufb00s of Horn\u00f8ya Island in Norway, back in April 2018. It shows two puffins which started a brawl that continued down the snowy slope right in front of me. My goal for this trip was to try to get some images of fighting puffins on snow and in that regard my quest was a success. I was really lucky and my patience and persistence paid o\ufb00. These two puffins battled for several minutes, with feathers and snow flying everywhere. It was a fantastic experience \u2014 for me, if not for the puffins.\nYou can find more photos and information at Bird Photographer of the Year.", "comment_count": 7, "like_count": 906, "created_time": 1617642582027, "comment": [{"user_id": "13d08c52c821", "comment_time": 1617642582027, "comment": "Thank you for sharing!"}, {"user_id": "c8d2aae13341", "comment_time": 1625031364638, "comment": "Such magnificent shots!

Or defame or intentionally lie about critical race theory. Or just downright oppose meaningful societal change when it comes to race.\nArguments like those listed above are especially pervasive during this time of year, as people across the political spectrum celebrate Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s birthday. The likes of Ted Cruz, Mike Pence, and Ivanka Trump all have paid tribute to the late Dr. King while simultaneously failing to denounce Donald Trump and his brand of race-baiting. All the while, these people never support any meaningful improvement or investment in Black communities.\nIn my native state of Ohio, Republican senatorial candidate and former treasury secretary Josh Mandel recently remarked that \u201cMartin Luther King once said that he had a dream that his grandkids would be judged not by the color of their skin but by the content of their character. But what you have going on in the government schools by these liberals and the media, and by the secular left, by the radical left, they\u2019re trying to make everything about skin color.\u201d Oh, Josh Mandel, the civil rights champion.\nRight-wing protests of anything dealing with racial justice have from time to time featured Dr. King signs or quotes.\nDonald Trump himself charged that the modern civil rights movement is \u201cdistorting\u201d King. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy\u2014in his fight to prevent having kids taught the true history of our nation, Black accomplishments, and the sins of our forefathers\u2014also cited Dr. King, saying critical race theory \u201cgoes against everything Dr. King has ever told us.\u201d\nI\u2019d forgive you if you\u2019re starting to think this is Comedy Central; alas, they\u2019re serious.\nAfter 2020\u2019s Stop the Steal insurrection at the Capitol, newly elected Republican Nancy Mace likewise used King to defend the lawbreakers: \u201cI\u2019m asking my colleagues to remember the words of the legendary, the great leader in this country Dr. Martin Luther King, who once said the time is always right to do what is right.\u201d Yes, Dr. King, the Trump conspiracy supporter. Oy.\nMinions of the far-right are using Dr. King\u2019s legacy to speak out, ironically, against ideas designed to combat racism and against those advocating for our children to be taught a more truthful and complete history. Sit with that.\nIn true honor of MLK Day this year, let\u2019s focus on reaching the dream, not by endlessly reciting his most well-known speech or quoting Dr. King in the same breath as passing anti-voting rights bills.\nLook, we know MLK strongly advocated nonviolence as his means to change. We all know that Dr. King had a dream. He wanted a world where we judge people on the content of one\u2019s character rather than skin color. A world where people aren\u2019t shot based on fear of skin color.\nBut none of that meant Dr. King denied systemic racism. Or that he thought we were on the cusp of realizing his dreams.\nKing\u2019s peace-loving pronouncements never meant that we were entering a post-racial world. Or that Black folks shouldn\u2019t fight to matter. Or that honest education about America\u2019s past and present was a bad thing.\nKing\u2019s deeper legacy and revolutionary charge ought not to be undone, despite collective attempts to put Dr. King into a timid \u201cwe shouldn\u2019t demand justice or make too many waves\u201d bottle, or folks\u2019 efforts to reduce him to his dream and a few quotes that read nicely on a T-shirt or coffee mug.\nIn 1956, at the beginning of the now-famous Montgomery bus boycott, Dr. King was unequivocal about his infuriation with how Black people were treated. He wasn\u2019t singing Kumbaya.\n\u201cToday\u2019s expression in Montgomery is the expression of 50,000 people who are tired of being pushed around.\u201d\nWhen William Faulkner advised Dr. King to \u201ccalm down\u201d while White folks got used to the idea of equal rights, King shot back.\nSorry, not gonna happen, charged King. \u201cWe can\u2019t slow up because of our love for democracy and love for America.\u201d King didn\u2019t buy into the concept that patriotism meant keeping quiet.\nKing even spoke of White privilege all the way back in 1965, when he thanked White allies for choosing a different path.\n\u201cWe must pay our profound respects to White Americans who cherish their democratic traditions over the ugly customs and privileges of generations\u2026\u201d\nLest you think King would have sat idly by while Black men and women are racially profiled by police, unarmed people are gunned down by officers of the law, and cops\u2019 knees are applied to Black necks, Dr. King was about as pro-protest as they come.\n\u201cEvery man of humane convictions must decide on the protest that best suits his convictions, but we must all protest,\u201d he once said.\nSave so much misplaced, intentional hyper-focus on the minuscule fringe looters and property destroyers. King would have been leading our protests.\nDr. King likewise understood that a system that keeps producing unequal results fundamentally and systemically needs changing. \u201cTrue compassion is more than flinging a coin to a beggar,\u201d he said. \u201cIt comes to see that an edifice which produces beggars needs restructuring.\u201d\nDr. King\u2019s real impact wasn\u2019t in the dream that we might be able to achieve when the real work begins. It was in his demand that this country changes its ways fundamentally and permanently with race.\n\u201cOur only hope today lies in our ability to recapture the revolutionary spirit and go out into a sometimes hostile world declaring eternal hostility to poverty, racism, and militarism.\u201d\nYou read that right: eternal hostility to racism. Not white gloves. Not let\u2019s hold hands and pretend nothing\u2019s happening. Hostility.\nIn true honor of MLK Day this year, let\u2019s focus on reaching the dream, not by endlessly reciting his most well-known speech or quoting Dr. King in the same breath as passing anti-voting rights bills.\nLet\u2019s embrace and effectuate fundamental systemic change to the way America educates and operates when it comes to race.", "comment_count": 12, "like_count": 956, "created_time": 1641482515606, "comment": [{"user_id": "ef4fa60f69f", "comment_time": 1641482515606, "comment": "Thank you for sharing!"}, {"user_id": "1e562285bbec", "comment_time": 1642172961981, "comment": "I see the irony you suggest, but I think there's also irony involved in claiming to speak for Dr. King while advocating racist solutions.

Unjust Systems Do.\nEnd critical race theory hysteria and instead, let\u2019s educate\nImage: Billion Photos/Shutterstock\nAmerica is in a bit of a frenzy these days to abolish books and ideas that might in any way challenge our ingrained thinking on race.\nMore guns. Fewer books. Got it.\nThe scholarly, decades-old framework known as critical race theory is mostly taught to law students and holds that racism goes far beyond individuals\u2019 personal prejudices. CRT maintains that racism is systemic and deeply woven into America\u2019s laws and institutions. I\u2019m not even sure why it\u2019s called a theory, but that\u2019s for another day.\nTo people fearful of confronting race issues in America, though, CRT has become the catchall phrase for anything that might give our kids added perspective about how and what we\u2019ve been taught for generations.\nThat fear has turned into a full-on assault on any education regarding race. We seem lucky to have Black History Month, at this point.\nThe American Library Association\u2019s Office for Intellectual Freedom counted over 1,500 book challenges to library, school, and university materials in 2021. For perspective, there were 156 challenges in 2020 and 377 in 2019.\nIn Tennessee, one group sought to ban \u201cRuby Bridges Goes to School\u201d from Williamson County Schools. The book tells the well-known story of the author, who at age 6, had to confront a mob of segregationist parents angry that the Black child was attending their formerly all-white public school in New Orleans. The group seeking to eliminate the book complained the story doesn\u2019t sufficiently redeem the white people who targeted the Black child.\nSimilar efforts sought to ban such titles as the young adult best-seller, \u201cThe Hate U Give,\u201d one of the 10 most-challenged books of 2020. My 17-year-old daughter knows the story, and she\u2019s doing just fine in case you\u2019re wondering. Other targets included \u201cBrown Girl Dreaming,\u201d a New York Times best-selling memoir by Jacqueline Woodson about her childhood as a Black girl in the 1960s and 1970s. It\u2019s $6.87 on Amazon now, in case you live in a place where it\u2019s banned.\nThe list of other similar books on the chopping block is exhaustingly long.\nIf that weren\u2019t enough, 13 states passed educational gag order bills from January 2021 through March, 2022; 40 states introduced 175 similar bills in that time, and more than 100 are still under consideration, according to PEN America. Some of the laws ban conversations about racism by framing race discussions as \u201cdivisive\u201d and \u201charmful.\u201d\nSeveral state assemblies have presented \u201canti-truth\u201d bills in 2022. Another 16 states now prohibit the teaching of racial equity to state employees, which followed Trump\u2019s earlier ban at the federal level (an order revoked by Biden).\nWhile Oklahoma marked the 100th anniversary of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre, the state legislature simultaneously passed a measure limiting discussions about race in K-12 schools and making it illegal for such discussions to leave students feeling racially-based \u201cdiscomfort.\u201d God forbid we\u2019d have to ever grow. I guess the oft-repeated hard work and \u201cno pain, no gain\u201d philosophy only applies to Black folks.\nTennessee teacher Matt Hawn brought Ta-Nehisi Coates\u2019 essay, \u201cThe First White President,\u201d to class for his students to analyze.

In his words, \u201cfor a lot of my students, this is the first time they\u2019re getting the opportunity to even assess something like that.\u201d Hawn was fired for daring to challenge our ingrained thinking.\nI suppose it\u2019s not shocking to hear about all these efforts to stifle discussion on race when many people don\u2019t read any books and now get their information from Facebook, memes and fringe \u201cnews\u201d outlets.\nThe irony of this shortsightedness is that all of America would actually benefit once all Americans are treated with dignity and respect. More peace, more opportunity and more education for all means a more robust and healthy society for all.\nThat can only happen when we as a country are finally able to learn about our systems of injustice and then, once identified and called out, tirelessly work to dismantle them.\nMost books don\u2019t harm people.

We ignore how we also have miles to go to become more evolved humans. To become part of solutions rather than unintentional perpetrators of unjust systems.\nIn recent months, I\u2019ve overheard a spattering of comments from White liberal friends that illuminate how far we have to go.\nThings like \u201cYou\u2019re a credit to your race,\u201d or \u201cYou\u2019re so well spoken.\u201d Phrases such as \u201cWhen I look at you, I don\u2019t see color,\u201d and \u201cThere\u2019s only one race \u2014 the human race.\u201d\nWhile statements like these seem well-intended and harmless, they convey deep racist undertones implying that the rest of Black people don\u2019t live up to some mythical white standard. They invalidate a person\u2019s identity as a proud Black man or woman.\nToday, blatant racism is often called out. White women get labeled \u201cKaren,\u201d for example, when they act like they\u2019re superior. Liberal Amy Cooper famously earned the moniker when she dialed 911 after a Black male bird watcher asked her to leash her dog in Central Park.\nBut \u201cCentral Park Karens\u201d don\u2019t shed their biases without deep reflection and conscious effort, and neither do many progressives who fancy themselves as woke.\nOur own president has a long history of racist ideas and statements. He equated Black with poor as recently as 2019. But don\u2019t just blame him; studies show liberals increasingly associate Black people with poverty and actually end up having far less empathy for poor White people as a result.\nBiden also worked alongside segregationist senators to oppose busing to integrate the schools.\nIn 2020, Biden told a group of Latino journalists that,\n\u201cunlike the African American community, with notable exceptions, the Latino community is an incredibly diverse community with incredibly different attitudes about different things.\u201d\nBiden even asked a Black journalist if he was a drug addict when the reporter merely asked Biden if he had taken any cognitive tests. A fair question given his numerous gaffes and missteps.\nBut of course none of this compares to Biden\u2019s admitting that the late senator and former KKK Exalted Cyclops Robert Byrd was one of Biden\u2019s mentors.\nYet liberals had no problem choosing him among all the many Democrats running for office. I\u2019m no fan of racist Donald Trump, but imagine if Trump had added Biden\u2019s resume to his own \u2014 what a field day we would have had with him. And rightfully so.\nMany liberals are all too guilty of making statements that assume one person from a minority group represents his or her entire community. Whether Black, Jewish, Asian or others. We\u2019re guilty of assuming a particular film or book represents an entire group. And we certainly are on the hook for expecting that we as White folks are the only ones who need to teach other White people about Black culture and racism.\nThe good news is there are concrete steps we can take to address the racism that ails liberals.\n1. Make Black friends\nToo many White progressives think all we have to do is be nice to our Black neighbor. Or exchange a pleasant greeting at a coffee shop with a random Black man or woman. Or go to lunch with a Black colleague. Or change our Facebook profile to all black every time an unarmed Black man is shot. We believe that\u2019s all it takes to live our best woke life.\nIt\u2019s not.\nWe need to make a genuine effort to pursue concrete and real Black friendships. And not so you can say you have a Black friend, but so you can actually learn from others and enrich your life and theirs. The more diversity we bring into our personal circles, the better chance we have of unwinding years of unconscious bias stored in every nook and cranny of our brains.\nWe cannot begin to combat negative imagery and ideas taught to us starting at an early age if we don\u2019t counteract them with real life experiences and relationships. We never saw ourselves as being part of some oppressive system or felt that we were unfairly advantaged. We thought it was all about individual morality.\nIt turns out there\u2019s way more to the story, and part of the cure is opening our homes and after-5 p.m. personal spaces.\n2. Be willing to give up some power\nIt\u2019s far too easy to pick your favorite far right-wing Neo-Nazi or Trump adviser as the poster child for racism in America, but we need to recognize that liberal Whites perpetrating racist systems are more concerning than powerless Klan rallies. We need to start advocating for real change in our own backyards.\nIn one racially woke Maryland suburb, where Whites voted for President Obama, they opposed efforts to ensure the schools would be more racially integrated.\nWhite liberals regularly oppose plans to add affordable housing near their neighborhoods.\nSome even oppose plans to change curricula in schools that it might teach our kids about racist systems.\nUntil we\u2019re ready to give up some of our resources, power and spaces in our own lives, we cannot advance racial equity.\nWe complain about a deteriorating society and yet we aren\u2019t willing to help provide the systems to give people the same hope and opportunities we have in our own lives. We can\u2019t have it both ways.\n3. Change the language\nA 2018 Ivy League study found significant evidence that White liberals dumb down their language when they speak to Black people and that they try to appear less competent to Black people than they do when interacting with Whites. White conservatives, on the other hand, overwhelmingly spoke to Black people and exhibited their competence no differently than when interacting with Black or White folks.\nWhile liberals may think they\u2019re just trying to connect with Black people, what they\u2019re doing is employing and perpetuating negative stereotypes. Some self-reflection by liberals on learning how to speak with Black folks would go a long way toward ending use of these horrific stereotypes that only demean Black people.\nThere\u2019s no question that White liberal allies have done much to fight racial injustice. That ought to continue.\nBut maybe, just maybe, we could do more to clean up our own houses to live the solutions rather than just advocate for others to do them.", "comment_count": 2, "like_count": 195, "created_time": 1650892478519, "comment": [{"user_id": "ef4fa60f69f", "comment_time": 1650892478519, "comment": "Thank you for sharing!"}, {"user_id": "c5c9cfbdc460", "comment_time": 1650922024475, "comment": "In terms of surface content, this is all great stuff.

He was moving to the United States to attend college in Kansas City, Missouri. Curious and excited, he bombarded me with question after question. About America, about politics and about me personally.\nI was happy to answer his questions, but one statement, which came after he learned I was Jewish and a lawyer, caught me off guard.\n\u201cJewish lawyers are the best lawyers,\u201d he said matter-of-factly, as if to pay me a compliment.\n\u201cHow many have you met?\u201d I asked half laughing.\nHe had never been outside of South Korea, and I already knew his answer. He had learned from popular media, news and entertainment that Jews were supposedly great lawyers.\nI decided to flip the tables.\n\u201cDo you know any Asians who are bad at math?\u201d\nMy new friend looked confused. \u201cWhy? Of course I do.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I know some bad Jewish lawyers, too. In America, there\u2019s a stereotype that Asians are good at math. That someone being born of Asian descent makes you somehow genetically better at math.\u201d\nOf course, over the years I\u2019ve heard the Jews-are-the-best-lawyers-and-doctors \u201ccompliment\u201d a number of times. I\u2019ve even been hired by people who told me they preferred to have a Jewish lawyer.\nWhile the stereotype seems harmless, it\u2019s not. And frankly, not all Jewish lawyers and doctors are good. Not all are smart. And not all are the best, despite my Jewish mother\u2019s views of me.\nHere\u2019s an incomplete list of why even positive stereotypes can be harmful.\nPositive turns negative without much effort\nWe can see how quickly \u201cthe Jews are smart\u201d and \u201cJews are the best lawyers\u201d and \u201cJews are rich\u201d turns to \u201cJews run the world\u201d and \u201cJews are then to blame for our world\u2019s problems. Therefore, down with the Jews.\u201d It\u2019s where the Q-Anon crowd got its start, imagining secret societies of wealthy Jews planning devious things. These world domination conspiracy bullshit dates back millennia.\nPositive stereotypes of Black people being good athletes can also turn the wrong direction. When Black kids want to be doctors or scientists or some other profession, will schools, teachers and others view them as smart, capable and worthy, or will they falsely assume the Black kids are more suited for sports? Or will Black kids feel pressure to play sports rather than pursue other professions? The stereotype of Black men and women being athletes has led to educational neglect and even the exploitation of Black male athletes.\nMost people aren\u2019t just born LeBron James, and when we over-employ stereotypes we can unintentionally (or sometimes intentionally) tell our Black and Brown boys and girls they should be athletes and not doctors or lawyers. It unintentionally informs the white population that Black boys and girls should be directed into those fields rather than academic pursuits. It even causes some of us to view others as entertainers. Here for our watching enjoyment.\nPositive stereotypes can keep the playing field unlevel\nImagine you\u2019re a fantastic, smart Black lawyer or doctor trying to make it in this world. A client or patient who thinks Jews are the best lawyers and doctors may not choose the Black lawyer or doctor based on the stereotype that he or she should choose the Jewish one. We ought to be choosing who performs surgery on our bodies based on skills and not stereotypes. It would be like playing a game of pickup basketball and choosing the Black player before knowing whether the Black player is good or not, all because of stereotypes. This is not in any way to suggest that we shouldn\u2019t intentionally and mindfully support Black, Latino, Jewish and other people and businesses, but we can do so without employing stereotypes.\nStereotypes marginalize individuality\nPositive stereotypes can have negative impact on individuals within the stereotyped group. Asian Americans, for example, are stereotyped as being the smart, \u201cmodel minority\u201d group, but interviews with individual Asians show that it makes them feel as though they are being depersonalized and not distinct human beings. Recipients of positive stereotypes also often believe they are being negatively stereotyped as well.\nThe pressure\nThe high expectations put on people to live up to stereotypes can cause them to crack under pressure. Or feel unworthy if they don\u2019t live up to the stereotype. A Black kid who doesn\u2019t fit the flattering Black-people-are-good-at-basketball mold may feel less than. A Jew who has a learning disability and doesn\u2019t do as well in school may feel like an outcast. An Asian who wants to pursue a path not stereotypically Asian, like art, may feel out of place.\nThese pressures can lead to depression, bad career choices and in the worst-case scenarios, deadly results. University of Maryland football player Jordan McNair died after his body was pushed too far to perform as expected as a Black male athlete.\nCelebrating with caution\nOf course there are some phenomenal Jewish lawyers. Jewish culture encourages education, and the entire Jewish cultural paradigm is to dig in, learn and debate the issues of the day. So maybe it\u2019s not a fluke Jews feel a connection to the legal profession. We should celebrate those accomplishments.\nOf course there are great Black athletes. It would be absurd to ignore that obvious fact. We should celebrate their achievements. Nobody\u2019s asking you to burn your Curry and James jerseys. Or to pretend Muhammad Ali wasn\u2019t the greatest.\nStill, while positive stereotypes may seem harmless or even beneficial, we should remind ourselves that they can have unintended negative personal and societal consequences.\nLet\u2019s be cautious about employing positive stereotypes.

Friends wanted to witness this moment and asked me to join them, but I couldn\u2019t since I had just started a new job. But when they came back, they brought me a small piece of the Berlin Wall; I recently had it in my hand again when cleaning out some old boxes (yes, I kept it). I also remember 9/11; I didn\u2019t do much else than watch CNN for days in a row. The television didn\u2019t provide much more new information, but I needed days to absorb the thought that terrorists did commit a crime at such an unimaginable scale and that this was not a bad dream.\nWe will all experience moments in our lives where we know that we witness world history unfolding. These are markers of humanity\u2019s meandering path of progress and downfalls on this planet. The brutal Russian invasion of Ukraine is such a marker; a new chapter in the book of the history of the world.\nRussian gas independence \u201cas soon as possible\u201d.\nYesterday, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen announced that the main parliamentary parties had agreed that Denmark should become independent of Russian gas \u201cas soon as possible.\u201d\nMeanwhile, in Germany, the Finance Minister announced that Germany had earmarked 200 billion euros ($220 billion) to fund industrial transformation between now and 2026. Christian Lindner added that this includes climate protection, hydrogen technology, and the electric vehicle charging network expansion. This decision follows the announcement last week by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz that Germany had to move quickly to reduce its dependence on Russia as an energy supplier. In addition, Germany also halted its Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project with Russia. These are just two examples of European countries drastically changing their energy policies, decisions that go hand in hand with radical changes in their defense policies.\nIPCC\u2019s report on climate change impacts ignored\nThe world hardly paid attention to the report that should have put climate change on the front page of all newspapers. Last week, the best climate scientists in the world warned in the latest IPCC report that there remains only \u201ca brief and rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a liveable and sustainable future for all.\u201d\nThe next day the president of the world\u2019s most powerful country, and historically and per capita the most significant greenhouse gas emitter, presented his State of the Union speech. President Biden mentioned the word \u201cclimate\u201d only twice. Once in the context of modernizing infrastructure to win the international economic competition and provide for more jobs. He referred to climate again when he spoke about cutting energy costs for families an average of $500 a year by combatting climate change. Sadly, it seems that the brief period of optimism of a year ago that the world would finally significantly step up its climate action ambition is one for the history books.\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine has dominated the news and pushed the IPCC report from the front pages. The BBC interviewed a leading Ukrainian scientist who is now sheltering with her family in her apartment in Kyiv. Dr. Svitlana Krakovska, a member of the IPCC, said that the war is closing the window of opportunity for the world to prevent the worst impacts of climate change.\n40% of EU\u2019s gas comes from Russia (Photo by Mike Benna)\nThe Russian invasion has also made painfully clear how much the European economy is dependent on Russian fossil fuels; about 40% of the EU\u2019s gas comes from Russia. Such a dependency makes it extremely hard to decide on an embargo on energy imports from Russia. The EU is still addicted to fossil fuels since its leaders systematically ignored the warnings from previous IPCC reports. Such an embargo would have been very effective because the Russian economy depends for more than one-third on oil and gas export.\nGermany relies on Russia for 56 percent of its gas imports, about half of its hard coal, and about 30 percent of its oil imports. But the dependency goes even further. More than a third of the German gas storage facilities are in the hands of a subsidiary of Gazprom, Russia\u2019s majority state-owned multinational energy corporation. Deutsche Welle reports that all the sites have one thing in common: they are currently almost empty, with levels at 10% or less of capacity. The German Minister for Economy and Climate Action, Robert Habeck, assumes that the storage facilities have been \u201csystematically emptied\u201d intentionally to drive up gas prices and generate political pressure.\nSpeeding up energy transition\nBut even though a decision to stop importing Russian fossil fuels can\u2019t be taken overnight, it doesn\u2019t mean that the Russian oil and gas industry won\u2019t be affected. The massive withdrawal of international energy companies leaves the Russian fossil fuel industry without capital and much-needed expertise. And Europe will focus on rapidly reducing the dependency, whereby one option is speeding up the energy transition to renewable energy.\nIn a recent podcast, I referred to Denmark\u2019s quest for fossil fuel independence from other countries after the oil crises of the 1970s, when 90 percent of the country\u2019s energy supply was based on imported oil. Some 25 years later, Denmark had become a net energy exporter and had earned a reputation as an innovator for wind turbines.\nLet\u2019s give the last word to Dr. Svitlana Krakovska, who said to the BBC from her apartment in Kyiv:\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing how the people of Ukraine united against one enemy,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIf we all unite against climate change, we can survive as a civilization.\u201d\nIf you find articles like this valuable and want to support my work, consider signing up to Medium.

The image is based on images taken by NASA\u2019s Galileo spacecraft in the late 1990s. (NASA/JPL-Caltech/SETI Institute)\nUnlike the daily news reports from hotspots in other countries, the news from space has its own rhythm. The planets quietly make their trips around the sun, all in their own lane, at their own speed, and in their own self-defined years. Planets are not troubled by pandemics or hostile takeovers, nor do they invade their neighbor. Still, two of our neighbors, Mars and Jupiter\u2019s moon Europa, received more attention in the media last week.\nPerseverance\nOn the Red Planet, NASA\u2019s Perseverance Rover had a good week; it broke the local speed record by driving a lightning tenth of a mile per hour across the bed of the Jezero crater. At this speed, the cute little explorer moved towards its new home for the next half (Earth) year. The first campaign on Mars, on the crater floor, has now officially ended, and the Delta Front Campaign officially started some ten days ago.\nPerseverance looks towards the Delta (credits: NASA/JPL-Caltech)\nPerseverance is now on its way to a spot called Three Forks, where once a river flowed into a lake and where scientists hope that the now disappeared river has dropped the rocks that it transported. The rover will drill cores at several places, and hopefully, it finds at this location a treasure trove of deposited material that is usually out of reach for Perseverance. And if we are lucky, scientists may discover rocks with signs of ancient organisms. Just imagine that: finding indications of life on another planet; I find this fascinating.\nAdmittedly, we\u2019re not talking about exotic intelligent green creatures with some human characteristics that will welcome visitors from Earth (and why would they?). Instead, if Perseverance finds any sign of life on the dry planet, it will likely be dead and undoubtedly tiny. But still, finding traces of ancient dead microbes on another planet must be unique.\nLife on Europa\nAnd that is not all the space news of this week. Astrobiologists got excited this week about Europa. It is of the moons of Jupiter, which is a prime candidate for extraterrestrial habitability in our solar system. It is covered with many double ridges, and scientists still don\u2019t fully understand how these got all over the surface of this icy moon.\nA double ridge cutting across the surface of Europa (credits: Credits: NASA/JPL/ASU)\nBut this week, scientists presented in Nature Communications the discovery and analysis of a double ridge in Northwest Greenland that looks remarkably like the ones on Europa. However, this one is easier to study, and its geological formation is better understood. It was formed by successive refreezing, pressurization, and fracture of a shallow water sill within the ice sheet.\nThe scientists suggest that the same process may be responsible for Europa\u2019s double ridges and that shallow liquid water is spatially and temporally ubiquitous across Europa\u2019s ice shell. As we all learned at school (let me reformulate that: as we all should have learned at school in the same biology classes where every kid should have been taught about evolution), early microbial life on Earth evolved in the liquid saltwater. Add all this information up, and then the possibility of life on Europa suddenly looks more promising.\nIf there has ever been life on Mars, or if we would someday find life on Europa, the question pops up how it got there. And it seems we got one small step further in that quest as well. This week, an article was published about how scientists just found the two missing of the five informational units of DNA and RNA in meteorites. All DNA and RNA contain five informational components called nucleobases. Scientists had already found three of these in meteorites, but now a team of Japanese scientists found the missing two in extraterrestrial samples. This strengthens the theory that chemical reactions in asteroids could have provided essential building blocks for life on places like Earth, Mars, or on Europa.\nLife in Europe\nScale down from the universal level to life on Earth, and the picture dramatically changes. The possibility of finding life on the moon Europa sounds exciting, but life in some parts of Europe on our planet is a terrible nightmare for millions. Every day, I am shocked, saddened, angry, and frustrated about the horrific events in Ukraine. And unfortunately, reading today\u2019s news doesn\u2019t give much hope for an end to the people\u2019s suffering.\nWars are always hard to understand, and this one is exemplary in that aspect; why? So let me give a word of advice to those microbes on icy Europa: stay put. And in case you have any evolutionary ambitions for the next billion years: be inspired by koalas, pandas, or cute little piglets. Don\u2019t develop your brain any further, don\u2019t believe that two legs are better; your moon will thank you for that.\nIf you find articles like this valuable and want to support my work, consider signing up to Medium.

I hope this day will signal a renewal of our trust in democratic values in Europe. A sign that we don\u2019t believe in populist nationalism and that democracy wins over non-democratic forces.\nFrance\nEmmanuel Macron was re-elected president of France with an estimated 58,2% of the vote, compared to 41,8% for his far-right competitor Marine Le Pen. I\u2019m happy to see that Macron\u2019s victory was larger than any poll had projected and that it was also the first time in 20 years that the French voters re-elected a sitting president.\nBut it is worrying that his victory margin was substantially narrower than his 66 percent victory against the same opponent five years earlier; Le Pen\u2019s score today was the best ever for her far-right party.\nSo we get five more years with Emmanuel Macron as the president of France. He has rapidly grown from a young newcomer to a central player in the world and a key decision-maker in the European Union. He has, for instance, recently been heavily involved in efforts to stop Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine.\nThe polls about his popularity give a mixed picture. On the one hand, many French people admire his presidential stature and believe he has shown that he can deal with significant global crises such as the pandemic and the Ukraine crisis. But on the other hand, he is frequently regarded as out of touch with the general public.\nBut whatever the view at home may be, it was clear today that many European leaders were relieved to see the re-election of a pro-European centrist. Macron quickly received congratulations from European leaders, including German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.\nSlovenia (photo: Luka E)\nSlovenia\nToday\u2019s good news for democracy and moderate non-populist European parties didn\u2019t end in France because there were also elections in Slovenia. According to exit polls, the opposition liberal party won by a landslide in the parliamentary election today. This result means a severe defeat to populist Prime Minister Janez Jansa.\nThe latest polls showed that the opposition Freedom Movement received 35.8% of the vote, compared to 22.5 percent for the ruling conservative Slovenian Democratic Party. So if the results are officially verified, the Freedom Movement, a newcomer in the election, will most likely form the next government in a coalition with smaller center-left parties.\nA critical juncture for Europe\nWe are at a critical juncture for Europe\u2019s future. With Russia\u2019s war raging in Ukraine, France has rejected a candidate who turned away from NATO, the European Union, the United States, and its core beliefs, like no discrimination against Muslims. As President, Marine Le Pen would likely have followed policies that would have weakened the united allied front in the fight to preserve Ukraine from Russian aggression.\nIQ-test\nMeanwhile, in the United States, nationalistic populism is still alive, as we could see yesterday when Donald Trump addressed a rally in Ohio. He claimed that people no longer call him \u201cstupid\u201d after passing a cognitive test in 2018.\nHe told his supporters that he hated being labeled stupid and wanted to prove his worth. Trump then mentioned a talk he had with Ronny Jackson, a Texas Republican who served as Trump\u2019s White House physician, in which he inquired if there was a \u201ctest\u201d he could take.\nLet me quote from his speech: \u201cI said to doc Ronny\u2026I don\u2019t like when people call me stupid. I have a great heritage. An uncle who is a great, great genius. A father who is a genius. I don\u2019t like to be called stupid,\u201d Trump said. And he continued: \u201cIs there a test or something I can take to prove to these radical left maniacs I am much smarter than them? And he said, \u2018Sir, there is a test. It\u2019s called an X test.\u2019\u201d\nAccording to Newsweek, it is the Montreal Cognitive Assessment that Trump is referring to (MOCA). The test isn\u2019t an IQ test; instead, it determines whether a person has cognitive issues like dementia or memory loss.\nIn 2018, Jackson gave him the test and said he got a perfect score. However, experts pointed out that MOCA provided no indicator of Trump\u2019s intelligence. An example of a question asked is sketching a clock showing a specific time.\nDespite this, Trump boasted about his perfect score, claiming that he \u201caced\u201d the exam. Remember that this is also the man who described himself as a \u201cvery stable genius\u201d on multiple occasions. Trump proudly proclaimed this weekend: \u201cNow, they don\u2019t call me stupid.\u201d\nTrump also mentioned remarks he made earlier this week in which he claimed he would rather be branded a tyrant than a dumb person during the rally.\nNeedless to say that the hashtag \u201c#StupidTrump\u201d was trending on Twitter today.\nSo how do I look back at this day:\nI try to forget about Trump for a day and will read up tomorrow on the latest January 6th findings. Instead, let\u2019s focus on Europe.\nOn the one hand, I am distraught that more than 40 percent of voters in France voted for a far-right presidential candidate. These voters have missed the disastrous impacts of having autocrats like Donald Trump or Vladimir Putin in power.\nBut on the other hand, I feel hope, at least this evening, after a good day for democracy. Perhaps we are learning our lessons, the same lessons that we could have learned from 20th-century history; that democracy (with all its flaws) is the best system and, above all, it is essential to make use of your right to vote. Together we can make a better world. And that starts with your vote.\nIf you find articles like this valuable and want to support my work, consider signing up to Medium.

It\u2019s a stark contrast with the island where I live in the Netherlands, where there are no hills and hardly any forests in the flat green fields behind the dunes and dikes. But there is the abundance of water that connects these two countries and lots of shared history that I wrote about when I visited some of the thousands of Canadian war graves in my country.\nWhen Ramadan, Passover, and Easter all coincide\nWater is vital in the identity of every country, as well as in every religion. Water and religion should unite people and not divide them, which I hope is the way more people see it at this particular moment when the world enjoys, under a full Pink Moon, the rare occasion that Ramadan, Passover, and Easter all coincide. The next time this will happen is in 2055, when you can be sure that the world will have dramatically changed, albeit in ways no one can predict.\nPerhaps it will be a better world, where Muslims, Jews, and Christians will respect each other and celebrate together. Today, the world seems to have forgotten about the unique meaning of the Abrahamic faiths celebrating at the same time. It should be a shared moment of hope for a better future, but just look at the front page of your newspaper or the trending topics on your favorite social media. You will be reminded how far humanity has drifted from fundamental values like compassion, solidarity, and respect for each other that are common to all religions.\nWhere three great rivers meet\nOn this particular weekend, when three religions celebrate major holidays, I walked where three great rivers meet: the Gatineau, Rideau, and Ottawa rivers connect in Canada\u2019s capital. Then, a bit further along the river, I read about the history of this particular spot where you can see the Gatineau and Ottawa Rivers converge. The point where the Rideau River flows into the Ottawa River is just a ten-minute walk further to the west. This confluence of rivers explains the capital region\u2019s strategic importance long before there was even a city; three converging rivers make this an ideal spot for transport, trade, and even politics.\nOttawa is now connected to the Trans-Canada Highway, a transcontinental federal-provincial highway system that spans nearly 7,500 km (4,645 mi). But long before the first highways and cars were built, the water formed a similar connection across Canada. From this spot, you can paddle a chain of lakes and rivers that stretches over 8000 kilometers from the Atlantic, west to the Pacific, and north to the Arctic. Then, I realized I was looking at the original Trans-Canada Highway. To the east, it is 200 kilometers to Montr\u00e9al, while it takes 7800 kilometers of travel to reach Betta Coola in British Columbia if you go west from this spot.\nWhere the Gatineau River flows into the Ottawa River, note the St. Fran\u00e7ois de Sales Church (photo: Alexander Verbeek)\nI took this photo in Ontario, just north of the capital, but what you see is Gatineau in Quebec. It is the fourth city of the province, and what you see in this picture is Pointe Gatineau, a village a bit to the north that has become part of the city. A likely explanation for the origins of the town\u2019s name is the historical connection to a fur dealing clerk named Nicolas Gastineau. His name appeared first in New France in 1648. Gastineau, a native of Paris, worked for the \u201cCompagnie des Cent Associ\u00e9s in Trois-Rivi\u00e8res\u201d. The Gatineau River was part of a long-used fur-trading route, but historians have not been able to find evidence that Gastineau actually traveled down the Gatineau. The best indication of a connection between him and the city\u2019s naming is the discovery in notarial records that his sons have been in the Pointe-Gatineau area in the late 17th century.\nA side note: I failed to find out why no expert suggests that this spot is simply named after one of the sons (or both of them) instead of the father. After all, if you can\u2019t find proof that the father of Amerigo Vespucci ever sailed along the shores of Brazil, it becomes more likely that America is named after his son. (Note that his father had a different first name: Nastagio Vespucci, which would have altered history in many ways if he had sailed to the west, including the naming of the U.S.A, a country that would then have been known as U.S.N).\nTimber rafts\nI love to watch the landscape at this spot where these rivers converge. Imagine that already, for thousands of years, people have paddled these rivers. Or think of the 1800s when vast timber rafts floated down these rivers all the way to Quebec City. For years people had speculated that this couldn\u2019t be done. But in 1806, Philemon Wright, the founder of Hull, launched a raft of 700 squared logs from the far shore. For two months, he and his crew battled the wild rapids of the Ottawa and St. Lawrence rivers to get the wood to market. His triumphant arrival in Quebec City began a century of timber rafting on the Ottawa.\nNot far from the same spot: looking to the East\nNinety years later, in 1896, Lady Aberdeen, the wife of Canada\u2019s governor-general, nearly drowned on the same far shore where Wright started his journey. She had taken the ferry for a spring outing from about the spot where I took the first photo. But her ponies slipped, overturning her carriage into the icy Gatineau river. The ponies were swept away, but Lady Aberdeen held on until help came. Then, in thanks for her rescue, she donated a bell to St. Fran\u00e7ois de Sales Church. The bell is still there today, and you can see the church in this picture. You can also see the dark clouds; I walked home just in time before it started to rain.\nIf you find articles like this valuable and want to support my work, consider signing up to Medium.

Electronic Arts (EA) spent over $3 billion to acquire smaller studios in 2021. Take-Two shelled out $378 million to acquire a Nordeus \u2014 a mobile game studio focused on sports \u2014 and the company has slowly assembled a large group of studios over the past two decades to help it grow to its current size. Even Sony (PlayStation) and Microsoft (Xbox) upped their acquisition game in 2021, buying several studios and bringing them in-house, allowing them to release even more exclusive games in the seemingly never-ending battle for console supremacy.\nBut this specific deal, and the high premium attached to Zynga\u2019s market value, showcases the quiet war happening between game developers.\nBefore Take-Two\u2019s deal for Zynga, it was lagging behind the top four gaming studios. As of November 2021, Roblox ($75 billion), Nintendo ($53 billion), Activision Blizzard ($47 billion), and EA ($35 billion) were all worth more than Take-Two ($20 billion). To become a true alpha in the industry, Take-Two had to make a splash. In order to do so, it paid a crazy amount of money for one of the top mobile gaming studios, making it the largest ever deal in the gaming world. Yet, it could pay off pretty quickly.\nWhat Zynga specializes in is free-to-play games. These games are free to download, but once you become addicted, you can make in-game purchases to improve the playing experience, or to access digital goods within the game economy.\nThese free-to-play mobile games bring in billions of dollars a year for the top studios. Call of Duty: Mobile and Honor of Kings contributed significantly to a $10 billion year for TiMi Studios in 2020, which helped the Tencent-owned studio outpace Activision Blizzard\u2019s revenue for the same year.\nTake-Two plans to use Zynga\u2019s expertise to turn popular titles such as Grand Theft Auto, Red Dead Redemption, and others into these free-to-play cash cows.\nThe acquisition and plan to expand into mobile makes perfect business. Mobile gaming produces nearly as much revenue as console and PC gaming combined, and the revenue is only expected to grow over time. These free-to-play titles do a good job of luring gamers in and enticing them to spend, much like Spotify with its \u201cfreemium\u201d model where users can either listen with ads or pay for an uninterrupted listening experience.\nIt\u2019s not \u201cpay to win, \u201dwhere paying money makes you a better player \u2014 though games have been accused of this proactice \u2014 especially because many free-to-play titles are adventure games. But it does save a whole lot of time, and any avid mobile gamer is willing to cough up some bucks in order to advance further than anyone not willing to spend.\nIn my personal experience with mobile gaming, Niantic title Pokemon Go becomes much more fun when you spend a little money here and there. Real-life dollars turn into in-game coins that can be spent on items to make catching and hatching new Pokemon that much easier.\nMobile developers have already become a huge piece of the pie for behemoths like Activision Blizzard. The $5.9 billion it spent for Candy Crush publisher King Games has now turned into 33% of the company\u2019s revenue.\nThat\u2019s going to make Take-Two\u2019s acquisition of Zynga just the beginning of seemingly overpriced acquisition deals.\nMobile gaming revenue is anticipated to grow 28% through 2024, reaching a total of $116.4 billion. There are about 2.7 billion mobile gamers worldwide, but with more and more people getting smartphones in their hands, that number will continue to increase.\nUnlike free-to-play games, the video game market itself could definitely become \u201cpay to win\u201d \u2014 whoever spends the most money, makes the most money. Two large companies could also merge together. Epic Games, publisher of Fortnite, is private but estimated to be worth about $29 billion (as of April 2021). Could Activision Blizzard, EA, or someone else seek to merge with a studio like Epic and take a roaring lead in market share?\nThat remains to be seen. But based on the acquisition storm of recent years, it wouldn\u2019t be surprising to see another huge move made by one of the top gaming studios.\nWhile massive mergers in any industry could be looked at as anti-competitive moves, larger companies give smaller companies a much longer runway. Games don\u2019t always work out, and the security of a huge company gives smaller companies an opportunity to get creative, try, and maybe fail.\nFor the user, this could result in a better standard of games. But it could also mean watered-down games that aim to make profits and not provide much value or entertainment.\nIt could go either way. As these big companies continue to grow through acquisitions, it won\u2019t take long to see who wants to turn a profit and who wants to build and maintain great games \u2014 for the sake of the user.\nSubscribe to my free weekly newsletter for my thoughts and findings outside of the financial world", "comment_count": 2, "like_count": 114, "created_time": 1641941681383, "comment": [{"user_id": "35595379faf7", "comment_time": 1641941681383, "comment": "The Video Game Wars Are Just Beginning"}, {"user_id": "4cffd19626e0", "comment_time": 1642576463568, "comment": "Feels good to be right, eh?

I said that this was a dumb way to think.\nI pray to God that my brother, who will be 23 when he gets out of the military, is willing to leave his four years in the past and become educated in another field \u2014 if that\u2019s what he wants to do, of course.\nMy main hang-up was that my mom\u2019s friend sees these four years as a \u201cwaste\u201d if my brother doesn\u2019t use the skills/knowledge after ejecting from the Air Force (no pun intended).\nIn reality, he could be wasting the rest of his life by staying in this field\u2026\nThis then prompted my dad to bring up people he has come across in the past that viewed work this way, too.\nMy dad was in the Air Force as well, performing nine years of service. When he told people he was going back to civilian life, he was confronted with people saying, \u201cWhy leave now? You only have 11 years to go!\u201d\nTyping that out only made it seem sarcastic to me \u2014 viewing 11 years as a small amount of time and the nine years prior a waste if retirement benefits weren\u2019t waiting on the other side.\nThis seems to be the mindset of many Baby Boomers. You do one job for 40+ years (or for the military, 20 years) and get retirement when it\u2019s all said and done.\nThe Millennial and Gen Z generations have agreed that this is stupid. Changing companies, job titles, and even careers altogether may be scary, but it turns you into a swiss army knife and increases your flexibility to the nth degree.\nThese two generations have traded in the safety and security of a 401k and pension for this increase in flexibility and professional growth. But some have taken an extreme course of action that may be just as insane as the Baby Boomer approach.\nI introduce to you, FIRE: Financial Independence, Retire Early.\nThe FIRE approach seems great on the surface: you receive an awesome education (through college or otherwise), get a great job, and save as much as humanly possible. By your mid-30s to early-40s, you\u2019ve got enough money to retire and spend your time doing whatever the heck you want!\nAnd depending on your job and/or your significant other\u2019s job, if applicable, you could retire even sooner.\nThis can, and does, work for a lot of people. But there are a lot of reasons why this is a bad goal to have.\nThere\u2019s a good chance you will hate your job\nIf you are working super hard to retire early, there is a good chance you just don\u2019t like working that much. Otherwise, you wouldn\u2019t already be planning to stop working\u2026\nThis is another hand-me-down ideal from the Boomers that the Millenials (and maybe Gen Zers; TBD) weren\u2019t able to completely ditch. Work doesn\u2019t have to suck \u2014 and we should stop looking at it as something we have to do.\nFor the Boomers, work was never really questioned. You worked because you needed money and you hoped your boss didn\u2019t piss you off too much. This acceptance has worked well for the Boomers, but the following generations have decided that wasn\u2019t for them.\nMillennials took more control over their work lives, but there is still a lot of misery. How many of these people worked hard towards becoming lawyers, bankers, or other highly-paid suit-wearers only to realize how much it sucked once the pandemic hit?\nGen Z suffered from this, too, but we\u2019re all still pretty young and fresh in the workforce. Plus, we\u2019ve known what the internet has to offer for years. We didn\u2019t need to work from home to see how easy it is to make money on the internet.\nThe internet offers an abundance of choice. That means that, sure, you could become a computer programmer or something else that pays bookoo bucks and work from home. And if that\u2019s a career that interests you, it\u2019s a win-win: you get to spend your time doing something you like AND make a ton of money, allowing you to retire early.\nBut if you loved that job, why would you want to retire? Wouldn\u2019t you want to do it for a much longer time?\nIf the answer is no, maybe you find something else to make money. Or you make that thing you love a side hustle in hopes of building it up over time to become self-sustaining. By the time you reach that early retirement age, you\u2019ve only retired from doing the thing you like \u2014 not love.\nMany FIRE folks aren\u2019t doing jobs they like, though. In hopes of reaching financial independence in 15\u201320 years, they\u2019re trading in 40+ hours a week of present time, wasting precious years of their youth.\nYou can spend time doing things you like right now!\nEveryone wants to retire so they can do whatever they please with their time. But maybe there\u2019s an even better way to go about it\u2026\nDoing what you like right now!\nI know, it\u2019s a foreign concept to some. But it is possible. You can actually enjoy life right this second!\nYou don\u2019t have to dream about living in Florida or playing a lot of golf or fishing on the lake. You can do it tomorrow if you\u2019d like!\nThis is easier said than done, of course. And you\u2019ll never have as much free time as you will when you\u2019re 70. But you\u2019ll also be old and decrepit by then and not as excited about going out and exploring the world.\nInstead of trading in so much time working every week, you can make more time to enjoy what you like doing and not worry about saving so much. Having $100,000 or $500,000 or $1 million in an investment account looks great, but it\u2019s ultimately just numbers on a screen until you start using it.\nIt may not be feasible for you to live in your dream destination and go all-out on your hobbies now, but today\u2019s working world offers more flexibility than ever. If your bank account is starting to look nice and fat, consider trading a few hours of work for a few hours of play.\nWhat if you\u2026 die?\nI\u2019m sorry for being a buzzkill. But I truly believe that everyone should keep this in mind when making any sort of long-term plans in life.\nJust imagine this: you worked hard for 20 years so that you could retire young. You\u2019ve saved up plenty and can easily coast towards the end of your life with no financial concerns. You have the rest of your life to relax and have fun.\nAnd then you have a heart attack.\nThere\u2019s a reason monks are so at peace: they don\u2019t do anything. If you\u2019re working hard to achieve financial freedom, you\u2019re going to rack up some stress along the way. The older you get, the more likely that stress is to start causing you some problems.\nBut even if you worked with minimal stress, you could get struck by lightning or eaten by a shark or obliterated by a Tesla on Auto-Pilot. There is no telling what tomorrow has in store.\nStoic philosopher Marcus Aurelius wrote long ago, \u201cYou could leave life right now. Let that determine what you do and say and think.\u201d He also lived with the phrase \u201cmemento mori\u201d \u2014 remember that you must die \u2014 constantly ringing in his ear.\nAurelius wasn\u2019t depressed or morbid. He knew that this world can take you whenever it pleases and that assuming a long and prosperous life ahead is a fool\u2019s errand.\nWe all hope to live long. But not all of us do. So don\u2019t plan for a financial future that might not exist when you can enjoy work, and life as a whole, right now.\nWant to see more of my writing?

I just recently started a new job and have held onto my freelance writing gig while also writing here on Medium. I\u2019ve also published a couple of books and am in the process of writing my next one.\nI\u2019m drowning in side hustles! And I bet you are, too.\nSide gigs (I actually hate the phrase \u201cside hustle\u201d so we\u2019re ditching that) are cool. They allow us to scale up our income during our free time, potentially building something over time that can become a major source of personal revenue.\nOr, at the very least, they provide supplemental income that allows us to indulge in more of life\u2019s luxuries.\nThe problem is, however, these luxuries can easily become just another activity for us to monetize. It becomes a slippery slope where we view every waking minute of our time as a time to make money.\nAll of a sudden, there is very little time to simply debrief. Every activity becomes a new revenue stream.\nWhere does it end?\nI recently found a productivity YouTuber named Ali Abdaal that you may know and like.\nI like him, too. I have found plenty of his videos to be helpful and entertaining.\nBut a recent video of his really bothered me.\nIn this video, which is linked here if you\u2019d like to see it for yourself, Abdaal ran through his goals for 2022. Productivity content creators often shoot for the stars when it comes to their goals, which is exactly why they\u2019re able to accomplish so much.\nAbdaal\u2019s first goal was to finish his book, which is a great goal to have. The second goal is where I became annoyed.\nHis second goal was to get into a good fitness habit, which on its face is another awesome goal to have. But to pair with that, Abdaal wants to become a Gymshark athlete while also striving to one day be featured on the cover of Men\u2019s Health.\nAbdaal\u2019s reason was this\u2026\n\u201c\u2026to have a project to work towards so that working out is not a workout in just me lifting weights up and down against gravity but it\u2019s actually working towards something.\u201d\nAbdaal\u2019s reasoning makes sense. He feels that it will be easier to build a sustainable fitness habit if there is a true end goal. As someone that has had their motivation to work out wax and wane over the years, setting goals like this does seem to be a sound strategy for staying consistent over time.\nAbdaal also didn\u2019t claim that the Gymshark and Men\u2019s Health goals were real goals that he\u2019s super dedicated to; just something he\u2019s flirted with.\nI wouldn\u2019t be annoyed with this on its face. But it seems like Abdaal can\u2019t do anything if there\u2019s not a potential revenue windfall that could come from it.\nNot too long ago, he made a video discussing how he remembers everything he reads. Again, great and useful information. Part of this includes extensive note-taking, which of course, he publishes on his website after finishing \u2014 where he\u2019s surely collecting ad revenue.\nSo now Abdaal has discussed two activities \u2014 working out and reading \u2014 that most people use for leisure and debriefing and turned them into revenue streams (or hopeful ones).\nThis is both why Abdaal is unbelievably successful and also why so many people feel like they\u2019re not doing enough in life.\nThe flexibility that the internet gives us is both a gift and a curse. It allows us to monetize anything and everything, giving us so many options to make money. It has helped me monetize my writing and I am forever grateful for that.\nBut if I started monetizing everything I did in my life, I\u2019d be miserable.\nIf I took in-depth notes of every book I read, did vlogs at the golf course, or made a podcast about every show I watch, I\u2019d become overwhelmed beyond belief.\nAbdaal and many of the other productivity content creators don\u2019t seem overwhelmed, so perhaps they are just mentally stronger than me. Maybe they don\u2019t need to debrief and spend much time relaxing.\nBut they have to have viewers that want to be like them and just can\u2019t do it. Once discovering that, they just end up feeling bad about themselves.\nAgain, there is a reason why Abdaal is so successful. He was a damn doctor before transitioning to content creation full-time. He has succeeded at the highest level in many areas, and his YouTube channel makes it easy to see why. He collects knowledge at an incredibly high rate and is able to turn that knowledge into coin.\nHe\u2019s also helped a ton of people become more productive and, therefore, successful. The point of this post is not to trash him or anyone else.\nThe point is to say that this behavior is extreme and that not being like that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re behind. A very small percentage of humans can \u2014 and should \u2014 work like that.\nIt\u2019s great to be working towards one or even a handful of things on the side of your main job. But please, for the love of God, don\u2019t let these uber-successful productivity content creators make you feel bad for not monetizing your skincare routine and daily walk.\nWant to see more of my writing?

I had no experience in music or management. I was unqualified and had to burst out of my bubble to take on the opportunity.\nI\u2019m now a month in, and this is easily the best job I\u2019ve had. But, more than that, it\u2019s completely changing how I look at work.\nFor so many people, work sucks. It\u2019s a means to an end \u2014 a way to feed the kids and pay down the mortgage. It\u2019s time spent suffering to earn some time to enjoy life.\nIt\u2019s how you end up hating life. But life is awesome. There are so many incredible things to do. The trick is, you have to expand your horizons and try new things. Writing has always been my comfort zone, and it probably always will be. Writing about the stock market was easy work, and it was decent money, but it wasn\u2019t fulfilling. I worked from home, stared at a computer all day, and rarely met anyone new.\nAll that has changed with my new job.\nYou should intentionally work outside of your comfort zone\nIt\u2019s amazing how quickly I got bored writing about the stock market.\nI\u2019ve always liked money and learning about new companies and how they could impact the future. But the stories started repeating, and the writing became tedious, the same headline with a different company. You start to see the cycle, and nothing becomes surprising anymore. I wasn\u2019t out in the world exploring and talking to new people; I was sitting on the couch doing no more than three hours of real work a day.\nWhat fun is an industry with no great surprises?\nSo when my old friend called me out of the blue and asked if I had any interest in becoming a tour manager for a band, I said, \u201cWhy the hell not?\u201d\nIt was the shake-up I never knew I needed. I took the opportunity, and it took no more than three days for me to know this would be a job I love.\nWas it scary? Sure, a little bit. I love music, but I don\u2019t understand the proper way to plug a guitar into an amp and how to adjust sound levels or pretty much anything else required to put on a good show.\nI do know how to talk to people, though, and I know how to be responsible. That\u2019s all I needed.\nThere was a lot to learn. And there is still a lot to learn. But with more than 20% of our tour already behind us, I can confidently say that taking this leap of faith was worth it.\nWork needs inspiration\nI never thought I\u2019d say this, but working at Walmart for four years taught me more than I ever imagined it would have.\nI wasn\u2019t a huge fan of most of the work I did there. It was tedious and unfulfilling. It was a way to make money through college and not much more.\nBut it also helped me become great at dealing with people.\nWhile the work wasn\u2019t fun, the environment was. I enjoyed working at Walmart a lot more than I should have solely because of the people there. It made me realize how much I thrived off of other people\u2019s energy.\nI was an introvert until I wasn\u2019t.\nI also collected a lot of stories and insight that has helped my writing. For example, I developed a huge crush on a girl I worked with and ended up breaking my own heart over it \u2014 which inspired me to write my first book, From One Young Soul to Another.\nI\u2019m a writer and always will be. Everything in my life will come back to writing. And while I did receive inspiration writing about the stock market, there was only so much curiosity that came out of that job. People inspire me, and I need access to them as much as possible.\nIf I\u2019m not interacting with others, I\u2019m not inspired. And if I\u2019m not inspired, the work won\u2019t be very good.\nUntraditional work is much more fun\nWhen you\u2019re 24 like me, with nothing holding you down, having the same schedule every day sucks.\nEvery day on the road is different. There are some similarities; we have to arrive at each venue at the same time for every show, and the setup and teardown is almost always the same process.\nBut it\u2019s not in the same place over and over again. It\u2019s in Macon, Georgia, then Sanford, Florida. It\u2019s Buffalo, New York, then Cleveland, Ohio. It\u2019s driving in the middle of the night during a midwestern hurricane just to get an extra few hours at home before hitting the road again later that week.\nIt\u2019s different greenrooms with different stories. It\u2019s a misogynistic sound guy one night and your band\u2019s biggest fan the next. It\u2019s forcing your trailer into a spot it really shouldn\u2019t go into while avoiding getting swept away in a flooded Alabama parking lot.\nAnd best of all, it\u2019s new faces every single day. It\u2019s not small talk with that guy you kinda like and the older lady that is nice when she wants to be. It\u2019s rabid fans that just want to have a good time \u2014 and your responsibility to help make that happen.\nIt\u2019s a different look at life each day. It\u2019s unique challenges that require off-the-wall solutions. It\u2019s crunchtime creativity \u2014 1% stressful and 99% fun as hell.\nThe friend that called me up and asked if I had any interest in this job, used my writing as a motivation. He knew that meeting all these people and seeing all of these places would give me inspiration beyond my imagination.\nHe was right. I\u2019ve already collected some fun stories in the short time I\u2019ve been with the band. When this is all said and done, I\u2019ll have at least one awesome book to write about it.\nBut perhaps my favorite thing is that I\u2019m not planning anything at all. For the first time, I\u2019m living in the moment.\nI\u2019m not sitting around examining every event and trying to figure out what it could mean. I\u2019m not taking mental screenshots in hopes of remembering it later. Instead, I\u2019m just here and enjoying it.\nI\u2019m getting paid to hang out with really cool people and see the country (and soon, the world). And this is work?\nWant to see more of my writing?

Elbein has traveled to Cuero, Texas, Peru, the Philippines and Guatemala, among many places, and written for outlets including The New York Times, Vox, The Texas Observer, and The New Republic. Q and A with Ally Bauer.\nPhoto from Saul Elbein\u2019s website About Page with permission: http://www.saulelbein.com/about-1\nQ: Where did your interest in journalism start? What made you choose freelancing?\nA: I always knew I wanted to be a writer; I think I\u2019ve been both lucky and unlucky in that regard, in that I both always knew what I wanted to do, and that that thing is a difficult one that doesn\u2019t pay well. More than anything else, I fell into journalism. When I was 12 I read this piece by Sebastian Junger in National Geographic Adventure, and it really opened up my sense of the possible. The fact that it was even in my house was a total fluke \u2014 my aunt and uncle, who were big outdoor junkies, had bought my family a subscription, which absolutely no one read. Except this piece was a profile of a commander in Afghan alliance fighting the Taliban, which ended up being sort of a capsule portrait of this beautiful and inaccessible part of Afghanistan, and of the generations-long war there.\nAnd as far as why freelance \u2014 well, I fell into freelance in a sense, because during college I was writing for anyone I could, usually without pay. But my first serious internship in Texas was at a magazine, the Texas Observer, that paid its interns freelancer rates \u2014 $.50/word, pretty respectable for being 21 and having no real expenses. My first piece was 3000 words; $1500, and pretty much from then on I found I was highly motivated by the cash incentive in publishing stories.\nCuero Bets on Fracking - The Texas Observer\nIn 2008, Petrohawk Energy sank an oil well on Charlotte Krause's land in the green fields north of Cuero. Drillers\u2026www.texasobserver.org\nBut I want to be clear about something else. I didn\u2019t choose freelancing, exactly \u2014 I graduated from college in 2010, just after the crash, and \u2026 journalism was in free fall. The old financial model of journalism \u2014 the paper provides content that attracts a readership, then sells companies advertising to target that readership \u2014 was falling apart, and few of the new innovative big data/web visualization/new media projects had really gotten off the ground. And all the magazines and papers were just hemorrhaging jobs. So the truth is, I didn\u2019t really have a choice \u2014 there were jobs, but not a lot of them, and they weren\u2019t stable.\nEurope's renewable energy policy is built on burning American trees\nIn the lowland forests of the American southeast, loblolly pines and cypress trees are grabbing carbon dioxide from the\u2026www.vox.com\nQ: How did your passion and interest in environmental issues develop? Is this what you always thought you were interested in reporting on?\nA: It was coincidence as much as character. I grew up running around the urban creeks in Dallas and Atlanta with my little brother, hiking with my family on weekends, and between those experiences \u2014 going on expeditions to \u201cnature\u201d and seeing the wildness that remained in the center of the city \u2014 I started to develop this kind of idiosyncratic relationship with the nonhuman world around me.\nI felt like there was this really vibrant, living world that surrounded us in the city, and it was just so strange to me that it was treated as essentially irrelevant. My little brother (himself a very talented writer and journalist) would come back from the creek by our house in Dallas with tales of having seen beavers, or carrying an actual snapping turtle. And so I guess I never much cared about \u201cthe environment\u201d or \u201cnature\u201d in the abstract but I cared about urban snapping turtles, and it didn\u2019t take a huge amount of imagination to see a connection between the pollution in their house, which was a creek around the block from mine, and the pollution in mine.\nThat said, I never planned to be an environmental reporter, inasmuch as that\u2019s what I am now; I always thought that beat was exceedingly boring. Very \u201cworthy\u201d or \u201cprecious,\u201d as people sometimes say \u2014 it\u2019s like it was this high-minded stuff you were supposed to be reading about but never much wanted to. Like getting dragged out on a hike by your way-too-chipper friends. No fun.\nBut then fracking and the pipelines came to Texas, and suddenly here was real environmental conflict of the sort that (I had learned during some backpacking trips to Latin America in the 2000s) the rest of the world had long had to deal with. Fracking made me really physically angry; it felt like a personal assault on the land I loved and had grown up on. And as I reported on it in Texas, it really surprised me how many people I met who, though we belonged to different political tribes, we really agreed on that sense of loss and insult when we saw a frack rig going up on the prairie.\nQ: How do you see environmental journalism evolving?\nA: I hope it\u2019s going to disappear, or \u2014 to say the same thing in a different way \u2014 that it will expand to swallow the rest of journalism. Ally, I think we\u2019re in the very early stages of what they call, in evolutionary terms, a bottleneck: as climate chaos increases and the world continues to shift, all life on earth is going to get stampeded through a very narrow passageway. Most of us are not going to make it through.\nWhat that means for reporting is that areas previously seen as \u201cenvironmental\u201d \u2014 soil health, water quality, pollution, carbon sequestration, crop health \u2014 are going to take on a lot more relevance than they did previously; \u201cnature\u201d is just not going to be able to be seen as separate anymore from the rest of economic, cultural, or political life.\nSaul Elbein\nSaul Elbein is a freelance journalist currently living on the road in South America. His work has appeared in the New\u2026america.aljazeera.com\nQ: How did you go about planning and preparing for your international travel? Is there anything you did not do that you wish you had done before you left?\nA: Okay, so this is the iron-hard rule of journalism, and of probably all business: she who pays the piper calls the tune.\nThe absolute most important thing I\u2019ve done on almost all of my trips is secure funding \u2014 it is much easier for a publication to agree to pay for a piece, and even kick in some money to cover expenses, if (1) you can give them the sense of a project that is already well underway, and where (2) they won\u2019t have to pick up the check for your expenses (though they will still pay your fee.)\nI did a lot of this through the Pulitzer Center, but there are an absolute ton of resources for journalists to cover expenses on public-interest projects, especially if they\u2019re solutions focused. And if you\u2019re reporting around the Southwest and Mountain West \u2014 which is a great place with amazing stories that don\u2019t get covered enough \u2014 then your expenses should be relatively low, i.e. you can do a lot of reporting on a little number of grant dollars, which is the sort of thing that makes funders very happy, and that therefore makes grant-funders inclined to give you more money in the future.\nIn conjunction with that, under the current model, you have to find a publisher, who generally pays for the work itself if not the expenses. (Publishers do pay expenses, but less and less these days.) Sometimes things don\u2019t work out with the publisher, the piece gets killed, they pay you a kill fee, and then (and this is what happened with my Cambodia story that ran in Vice, and the Philippines story that ran in California Sunday) you can sometimes then rework it and resell it to somebody else.\nDead Air\nThe Philippines is one of the most dangerous places in the world to be a journalist, especially if you're in talk\u2026story.californiasunday.com\nSo what that means is (1) you need, ultimately, whether you go freelance or staff, a well-curated network of editors or publishers \u2014 and I mean people you like, not publications, because publications fold but friendships last \u2014 who you get along with and who like your work and help you grow and will fight for you, and (2) that there is a huge opportunity for those who can figure out a way to get around the we-get-paid-by-publications-owned-by-billionaires-and-funded-by-ads model of journalism, say by self-publishing on Medium, building a following, and crowdfunding, say. I suspect that the more we all understand Internet marketing, the less we are dependent on publications to pay our rent.\nCambodian Journalists Are Dying Trying to Save the Country's Forests\nThis piece was made possible by a grant from the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting. By the time his wife worked up\u2026www.vice.com\nQ: What are your ethical values when it comes to reporting?\nSaul: This is something I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about lately. On the one hand, I think journalists can be really precious about the work they do and about what a calling it is, and what ethics we have. And yet on the other hand, for at least a century the business purpose of journalism has been, to repeat what I said above, to get a bunch of like-minded people together so that advertisers can show them ads. The fact that advertisers now have way better technology to find people is the specific reason why journalism is in such trouble; I think the disinterest that working journalists have taken toward the economics of the industry is the more general reason.\nTraditionally, you know, the reporting and business sides of newspapers and magazines and broadcasting companies are totally separated, and people don\u2019t have much to do with each other, and kind of look down on each other. And there\u2019s a lot of benefit in that \u2014 the idea is that there\u2019s a firewall between sponsors and coverage \u2014 but it also means that the news side can stop asking the crucial design questions of (as above) \u2026 Why are we making what we\u2019re making and \u2026 What do the people we want to reach want from us and \u2026 How are we going to support ourselves in doing it? I think in some measure the current market difficulties of the media industry come from generations of not really asking that question, because ad sales were good.\nSo \u2014 all of that is a roundabout way of saying that I think the responsibility of a journalist is the same as the responsibility of a carpenter or architect: you have to make things that are honest, beautiful, and useful.\nWhen I write a story, my responsibility is to distill the sense and use of that experience fairly, skillfully, and honestly for all the people who weren\u2019t able to go on that journey themselves. On a micro level, that means that the reporting has to check out, and I have to go against some of my own biases, and make sure everyone got a chance to speak their piece; on a macro level, it means that the piece is structurally sound, honest, hangs together, knows what it is trying to do, and does it without ego or show.\nGruesome Footage of Dairy Calves Exposes a Gaping Loophole in California's Landmark Animal Welfare\u2026\nO n a chilly night in December 2016, Julianne Perry led a group of volunteers over the shoulder of the highway and into\u2026theintercept.com\nQ: What are your views on objectivity in journalism?\nA: Personally, I\u2019ve never much cared for that \u201cobjectivity\u201d style of journalism, to the extent it even exists anymore, because I think it is boring and fundamentally dishonest. I much prefer people who have a point of view \u2014 as everyone does \u2014 but who are honest, self-critical, and self-aware about it. I grew up in Dallas listening to conservative talk radio, and I really loved it, even though I disagreed with those guys on everything; I liked that, tendentious blowhards though they mostly were, I knew where they stood. And I knew, too, that they cared about entertaining me as a listener; they did not take me for granted. There is an ethics in this as well.\nContrast that to the New York Times, which is so careful to be measured that they generally don\u2019t say much that is interesting at all. There\u2019s no better proof of that than this epic climate change piece that ran as a full issue in the Times\u2019 Magazine last year. It is a masterful example of a journalist who sees a global, dramatic issue \u2014 and sidesteps most of what makes that issue compelling, because he has to, because this is the New York Times\u2019 core thing, tell a \u2018balanced, objective\u2019 story. He spends the whole piece portraying as reasonable and wanting to take action on climate \u2014 and then ends up sort of waving his hands at the fact that the energy industry has been enormously successful, largely with the unintentional collusion of \u201cobjective\u201d media, in preventing any such action.\nBut then in a sense all this is old news \u2014 objectivity journalism isn\u2019t doing so well. It\u2019s pretty much just the Times and the Post and the Boston Globe; a few regional conglomerates. All the startups are really voicey, opinionated outlets like Vox and Huffington Post and Vice and Buzzfeed and Current Affairs and The Intercept and (on the other side) Breitbart and The Daily Caller. I think in some sense the consensus on this has just shifted a lot; I don\u2019t know that many people that talk about objectivity anymore as being the standard to aspire to.\nTree-planting programs can do more harm than good\nThis story was produced in partnership with the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting and the National Geographic\u2026www.nationalgeographic.com\nQ: What have you found most challenging while writing internationally/cross culturally?\nA: I am six foot two and white-passing (although my family is Jewish, which gives us a strange relationship with whiteness) and I often report in places like Southeast Asia or Latin America where most people \u2026 do not look that way. That means that I have to set them at ease pretty quickly, and also just to accept that I\u2019m going to be a figure of curiosity a lot of places I go, and to try and leverage that.\nThe biggest thing you can do for yourself in this regard, if you want to report from cultures and languages outside your own, is to find ones that you fall in love with. Find a land, a cuisine, a music, a set of stories, that speaks to you and whispers to you with the promise of a long period of discovery. That\u2019s essential because there is a world of things to write about, but motivation and attention are fleeting, and when you\u2019re in love it is much less trouble to motivate yourself. Progress happens by magic.\nMeet the Journalist: Saul Elbein\nIn the last decade 41 journalists have died covering the environment-more journalists than were killed while reporting\u2026pulitzercenter.org\nQ: What advice would you give to someone wanting to start a career in international reporting and environmental reporting?\nA: Journalism/reporting are in a lot of ways products like any other: they require inputs, they cost money to make, and they have to be sold. People tend to forget this, and I think that is part of why the business is in such disarray.\nAs a journalist, your body is a sort of factory which stews together all that you experience and spits out stories and insights. This process happens almost automatically \u2014 that is, you don\u2019t have to worry about \u201chow do I get ideas\u201d \u2014 as long as you\u2019re willing to (1) learn how to see and listen, (2) put yourself where the story is, which will often, especially as you get experienced, be where intuition takes you, and (3) capture what you find there, by writing or recording, and (4) go through it and reflect on it.\nDo all that, in a constant churn, and stories will pour out. A lot of people like to treat journalism like this really cerebral enterprise where you\u2019re sitting in your house Coming Up With Ideas. No. Make a habit of feeding your brain, give it a creative outlet, and it will make a habit of rewarding you with good ideas.\nOf concrete and corruption: Resistance kills Andes Amazon dams\nPresidents in Peru and Brazil, and construction firm Odebrecht, schemed to build 22 Mara\u00f1\u00f3n River dams; the people and\u2026news.mongabay.com\nQ: Any final tips to prepare for an international / cross-cultural journalism career?\nA: Travel as much as you can, even if it\u2019s close to home. Put yourself in uncomfortable \u2014 though not traumatic \u2014 situations to build resilience. Acquire outdoor skills if you don\u2019t have them \u2014 they\u2019ll make you useful in the field, which (though this is not the reason to do it) can impresses sources and colleagues. Do hard things, but don\u2019t be a martyr \u2014 know what your capacity is and don\u2019t throw yourself into experiences you don\u2019t want to have just because you think you ought to. PTSD is real, even for those who will never be in a gunfight; it\u2019s also very treatable.\nAnd if you want to do this business, treat it as a business \u2014 this is much easier said than done, but find ways to make it work for you financially. Look for like-minded colleagues and collaborators. Use the privilege of youth to build relationships and ask people for advice.\nAnd above all \u2014 write. Larry McMurtry suggests five pages a day, double spaced, (about 1250 words) on some actual active writing project. I can\u2019t claim to keep to that \u2014 I can say, though, when I\u2019m writing a lot, like a couple thousand words a day, everything else in my life seems to fall into focus.\nQ and A by Ally Bauer shared with the Reynolds Sandbox", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 0, "created_time": 1560538022906, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Journalism", "Environment", "Media Tips", "Rsjlab", "Climate Change"]}, {"author": "Reynolds Sandbox", "post_id": "ecbee4123a81", "user_id": "c06313253d64", "title": "Amitoj Singh, Now Leading the Story on the Future of Money", "content": "Amitoj Singh, Now Leading the Story on the Future of Money\nKingkini Sengupta interviews Amitoj Singh about his transition from sports reporting to political and financial reporting, his zeal for breaking stories and his challenges of changing stereotypes as a Sikh journalist wearing a turban on global television.\nAmitoj Singh started his career as a sports journalist with New Delhi Television.\nAmitoj Singh has been a journalist for the past 15 years and was previously the main anchor and News Editor at India\u2019s New Delhi Television (NDTV). Currently, he is the India regulatory reporter with CoinDesk, a New York-based news platform, leading the story on the future of money. Amitoj has also worked with CNN, Al Jazeera, Columbia Global Reports, Business Insider, and SBS Australia, and has covered a wide range of events including the 2021 storming of the U.S. Capitol, the 2019 General Elections in India, repercussions of the ISIS conflict in Iraq, the World Economic Forum in Davos, UNGA in New York, and the 2015 Cricket World Cup in Australia. Amitoj holds an MA in Journalism from Columbia University\u2019s Graduate School of Journalism and has been a Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld Journalism Fellow at the United Nations.\nRSJ Grad student Kingkini Sengupta has previously worked with Amitoj Singh on various news stories while being a part of NDTV.\nYou worked for 12 years with NDTV?\nSingh: Technically it\u2019s 12 years and just about one month more, but then loosely I was with them I\u2019d say around 2021 January, that was the last time that I did something for them, so I through the year of 2019, even though I left in 2019 I did cover Howdy Modi for them in Houston, I covered the UN for them, the UN General Assembly, I covered the IMF for them. I did some telephonic interviews and news from the US for them, then in 2020 when the pandemic hit, I did some more telephonic interviews for them, I think one or two more lives (live coverage) and covered the Black Lives Matter protests, I covered how Sikhs were helping New Yorkers during that tough time and then I was their political commentator through the crazy one week election result kind of situation where you didn\u2019t know who had one with Dr. Roy (Prannoy Roy, Co-founder, NDTV) and right after that I was there on January 6th, 2021 for the insurrection.\nI had predicted that that would happen, so I reached there and I reported on it and I shared whatever I had done with NDTV which they used and several other networks used it. And then on the 20th of Jan for the inauguration they signed me up for covering that day. I did a story, and live coverage the whole day and the night before.\nWhy did you join the media and why did you choose NDTV when you started off?\nSingh: I was a sports person who was playing cricket for a while. I was Captain of my state. And I was also playing cricket for Delhi, my college team Hindu college, which is perhaps one of the best teams at that level. That would be able to take on a Ranji trophy team. I replaced Gautam Gambhir (Indian cricketer) as an opener so that tells you a little bit about the status and the quality of players that were there and I was studying English honors and I was a sports person so even in school, I used to play seven different sports. I was very active when I left school and graduated from the University. I didn\u2019t really know what I wanted to do, and my sister Bani was working at NDTV and I asked her what\u2019s the toughest thing to do and I wasn\u2019t really interested in journalism at the time, but the movie Blood Diamond had come out . And I\u2019d seen that and that really made me excited about the role of journalists in the world.\nBut the reason I got involved was because Bani told me that the toughest test to work on at any TV is the sports desk. It\u2019s the best desk, most organized, most hard working, best quality of journalism and at the time it was, and so I said, this makes sense that I\u2019d be doing something challenging.\nAnd so I reached out to NDTV. Dr. Prannoy Roy did an interview with me.\nDuring the interview I said, \u2018Well, I actually want to be a war correspondent\u2019 but since you\u2019re not going to send me yet I\u2019ll take anything that\u2019s there.\u2019 He said, \u2018Let\u2019s start you off on the sports desk\u2019 and sports desk was unique because, unlike other roles at NDTV when you were on the desk mostly, you weren\u2019t allowed to go out, the sports desk gave you the freedom to everything, but it also pushes a person and makes one learn. The people at the sports desk give you time to be your mentor and they will literally be your teachers. They taught me everything. Some of them (former colleagues) were particularly hard but that taught me a lot. It\u2019s what I cherish and treasure now.\nSo, I didn\u2019t quite figure out what I wanted to do, how I wanted to do it and as a sports journalist, the first two months were a ride, I mean I was watching sport and literally talking about it, writing about it, archiving, editing a little bit here and there, helping with some research.\nAnd then I had a moment, where I was acting a bit overconfident. I was lashed out at by a senior colleague for something that was not my fault and she still apologized for it but from that point on, I got angry with them. And because I got angry with them, I decided to show them what I\u2019m capable of. I was staying long hours at work for no reason. I was listening to music while I was working. I stopped doing all of that. I used to enter the office three hours earlier, or at least two hours earlier and I used to be there till midnight, every day, so I would enter at seven in the morning and be there till midnight. They used to keep reminding me of time and asking me why I was not leaving for the day. I said I want to work and there\u2019s a lot to do. I was upset by this incident because I excelled in school and was a guy who really was proud of my abilities. Apart from a few at the desk, not many really understood the sport as well as I did because I was a cricketer, so I was very technically nuanced about cricket. At some point, Ajay Jadeja (former cricketer) said after a show, \u2018Why don\u2019t you get Amitoj to report or anchor as much as you should because the guy knows a lot.\u2019 At the time cricket wasn\u2019t just about who scored what and who won, which it is now! At the time we really got into technical analysis of the sport and every match, because there was no Star Sports, it was just ESPN. And we were the only sports show there in the country, and it was the best show.\nWe really dived down deep into the details of each strike, the analysis we did was very elaborate.\nThe desk recognized my ability and then after some years, I started to realize that I wasn\u2019t getting the time of day at the sports desk because there was such good competition and there were so many good people who were experienced and it\u2019s not like I wasn\u2019t good enough, it was just that they were already people above me who had spent too many more years and had much more experience.\nEventually I got that chance, with an opportunity to go to Australia as a journalist and one of the things that happened when I came back from the Australia test series, in which we lost four- zero and Sachin Tendulkar ( famous Indian cricketer) was supposed to get his hundredth hundred and that didn\u2019t happen and so there was bit of a hullabaloo. I switched my citizenship from India to Australia because I was born in Melbourne and as a result of that when NDTV got to know that I had an Aussie passport, it was very easy for them to send me while saving money on Visas. That got me a lot of exposure. They chose to send me over others, perhaps because that person would have to spend 50,000 bucks on the visa and at short notice that person couldn\u2019t really go but I could. That opened a lot of doors for me.\nIn 2014, I had a colleague at NDTV. And she was an anchor on the news desk.\nBecause we spent time working together closely in the same newsroom, I saw her life and started to pay close attention to political reporting.\nBy that time I was kind of done with sports coverage because what happened was the BCCI ( Board of Control for Cricket in India) had undercut journalism in India, and particularly cricket journalism because they wanted to give us accreditation for test matches. They were not making it easy for us to cover the IPL\u2019s (Indian Premier League). There were very few limited opportunities left to do on ground reportage and there were investigations that were becoming tougher. The resources that were given to this sports desk were completely being taken away.\nSo the sports desk was slowly becoming smaller,as they laid off people in two-three years, almost all of them. By that time, I had made a name for myself as an anchor because I had really taken into anchoring, I really liked it in the sense that it came very naturally to me. Not that I like to talk, but being in front of the camera was not a problem. I had a personality which was unique and there was something called presence of the screen which people said I had. At some point I indicated after the 2014 election (when Narendra Modi became Prime Minister of India for the first time) that I wanted to be on the political beat.\nI worked harder. In 2015 I was in Sri Lanka for the Test series of cricket, and while I was there, there was a presidential election.\nI wrote a news story and covered it for the news team, and I think people were impressed, and when I returned, the top news editors of the channel reached out to me and said, \u201c We want you to be our breakfast news anchor.\u201d\nI started doing slightly political sports related stories, like at the intersection of both society, politics and sports. I did an investigative show called the Good, the bad and the ugly of the BBCI which got the attention of everyone, where Barkha Dutt (one of the managing editors of the channel at that time) got a call from Arun Jaitley (Minister holding cabinet portfolio with the Narendra Modi government) to stop the show from going on air 15 minutes before air time.\nAnd with good reason the top bosses of the channel had stopped the show from going on air with just ten minutes to go, because there were certain things that I\u2019d said, which were a bit toned up. They toned it down. Other than that there was nothing wrong with the show.\nThat kind of bothered me a bit but I realized that\u2019s where the action lies, that\u2019s where real journalism is. By that time I had worked so hard that I had learned how to video edit, and be my own camera person. I was a video editor who was editing stories, I was a person who was doing montages, I was archiving footage, I was a producer who could be the output editor (plan live rundowns), I could go outside and be a producer of an entire show, I could do it all. I had been my own camera person when I had gone to Germany and shot an entire series. That gave me a certain amount of confidence, and I became a rundown person. I moved the rundown around like a crazy planner. As a result of that, when I moved to the news desk people weren\u2019t really aware of my potential, but over a period of time the energy that I brought became known. My ambition had risen so I worked harder between 2016 and 2019. I didn\u2019t stop and I think I got burned out because I would never say no. The bosses used to call me and asked me to fill in for others and I would immediately say yes.\nI used to come not necessarily hours earlier but I definitely stayed longer than I was supposed to, always. And what I did was I covered both sports, because the sports desk otherwise dissolved, I covered Jai Jawans ( well-known TV show covering different army battalions of India), I covered stage shows for them for their campaigns, I covered political stories from pollution to Facebook to political parties of India like BJP, Congress, Aam Aadmi Party, the whole gamut of things. By 2017 I started doing stories where I was breaking them and doing so in all news beats.\nThis caught everyone\u2019s eye. If the biggest story of the day was the Cambridge Analytica, within a week I would have a breaking story about that. So it would be in Defense, it could be in information technology, could be with any ministry, and I would just jump onto it and get a story, or break a story and that\u2019s what people started to take note of and that is where I realized more that I wanted to be a political journalist. It just hit home for me. I was making a certain amount of difference, and I was changing attitudes.\nAmitoj Singh Interviews Maria Fernanda Espinosa, former President of the United Nations General Assembly.\nWhat was the motivation behind all that you did, what was the source of the energy that you had and how did you channelize that?\nSingh: I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s one thing that drew me more than the other. There were several things. I think number one on the list was putting food on the table for my family. My father, my mother were retired individuals, and so I was financing the house. I was paying the rent of the house so I had to earn more money. I had to outperform.\nAlso, internally the motivation has always been something related to religious tolerance wherein I believe that the divisions that are there in society need to be quelled in favor of identity tolerance. I don\u2019t like to say religious tolerance .My point is let people be who they want to be and whatever they want and the mindset in India was shifting towards less tolerant India and me breaking stories, doing stories that would make people think differently, while having a happy face on air, rather than the grim look as news anchors mostly have, I wanted to be able to present the news in a way in which it was not less boring but telling it in a way in which is both energetic and does not feel like the end of the world. At the same time I had to inform and prepare people for what they were going to hear.\nThe other thing was that my fellow colleague was a woman. What she did brilliantly was leave her privileged life behind for reportage in some of the most difficult places in India, particularly U.P. as a woman to go and report and really see the difference and that was something which really inspired me because she was a privileged person and had attended a very good school and her parents were wealthy, she did not really need to do what most of us did out of necessity. She chose to do that because she wanted to get down and learn and do the shoe-leather reporting and understand humanity. That drove me also because I always believe that you don\u2019t really get to know what people are going through by sitting in the studio. At several times the editors would suggest that I do a story that I would not be super interested in but after getting to the ground I used to be moved by the story myself and get incredibly passionate and by the end of it, I used to be negotiating with the editors to not shorten the script. The other thing I cared a lot about was, I think this is the bigger theme, the most important, I believe that good journalism can change mindsets. I think we\u2019re biased inherently as humans, we have what is known as confirmation bias in our systems and I wanted to break through that constantly and challenge my own notions on several things. Finally, the other motivation was, while NDTV may have disproportionately targeted a certain politician during the early 2000s and vilified him consistently for about 10 to 15 years without making it about people of Gujarat who perhaps also endorsed him. As a result of that there was a kind of resentment coming from the new government. I stood for NDTV at the time because I saw people from the sports desk that I loved and people that I was friendly were all let go and I could not face them. So for me, I was watching some force come down hard on NDTV and I\u2019m always with the underdog so I was just going to fight for them, even if it meant that I wasn\u2019t going to get a raise for four years.\nSo I filled in during the staff shortage. When I was there we couldn\u2019t have an output editor to build rundown sometimes and we had just one anchor and I used to be the anchor and the editor. I would do the sports shows and immediately walk into the news shows, so I did all of it, because I felt that NDTV didn\u2019t deserve the reaction it got.\nI was like a very fierce advocate for objectivity. Everyone was going low on energy. One of the things that burnt me out was picking everyone up constantly, giving them that energy and helping them to do things. Nobody was getting a raise and people were quitting or getting fired and the news of raids on NDTV started making its rounds.I used to motivate myself and be reminding myself that there\u2019s a lot that NDTV has done good, which it has as one the leading news channels on Indian television. Without the channel, without Prannoy and Radhika, I don\u2019t believe we would have had TV journalism in India and sure it\u2019s taken a turn for the worse, but there\u2019s no doubt that the channel had been the flag bearer of truth even today and that deserves accolades and the recognition and acknowledgement and perhaps celebration. For me I wasn\u2019t going to let the ship sink and I took it upon myself to do better when I had 0.1% of the knowledge of what really was going on at NDTV and the pressure it was under. I was not part of management but there were instances where a separate platform reached out to me and said the channel is sinking. You should jump ship when everyone else is jumping ship.I refused and stayed on.\nOther places were offering me more money, better position. I decided I\u2019m just going to be in an organization that has always cherished loyalty and I\u2019m going to try to give my best and not leave it when it\u2019s going down or when it\u2019s being pushed down.\nIs there a story/stories that has stuck with you for the longest in your career ?\nSingh: When I was in the U.S. I had to present a reel to people who wanted to see my work, and so I went through hours of footage that was actually on the NDTV.com website, but also hours of footage that was not even there and I had to remember it and find the tape and it was amazing. One story that was my first was about Rohan Bopanna and Aisam-ul-Haq-Qureshi, an Indian tennis player and a Pakistani tennis player who had come together to form a pair.\nFor me that was beautiful. They were both amazing and so I went to the Delhi Lawn Tennis Association. I am a tennis player, my father was a tennis ITA level tennis coach who played at the highest level, my brother\u2019s a tennis player, we were all playing as a family, a week ago, so for me, it was a very natural space to be in.\nThat is one story that stuck with me, because it was sport and unity and was a great topic to cover.\nThere were several stories but the one that stood with me was a story that was close to my heart, because Uttarakhand was a state which had been bifurcated from Uttar Pradesh and as a result that the BCCI had not given it recognition to play Ranji trophy, which meant that an entire maybe two generations of cricketers lost the opportunity to represent India, and I was one of them. So for me, one of the stories that I wanted to do was Uttarakhand and I did that as a series, and perhaps the only time there\u2019s been an investigative show on the BCCI. I did it and it was about corruption in Delhi cricket which continues till date. Voting, selection, the power dynamics, politics , the role of politicians. So those kinds of stories and that was a half-hour show that stuck with me. I did a documentary of Sachin Tendulkar on the day that he retired, so I did a half-an- hour documentary when I went through 23 years of his career, every single footage possible, wrote an entire documentary script which is re-written about twenty times, the voiceover was updated about 15 times, the montages were redone and the music was chosen by me. It was just the whole effort that I put into something that I loved and like Sachin was one of the big reasons why I played cricket in the beginning but as a sports person he was a legendary and still is really God of the technicalities of the sport and particularly cricket. After that there were a few, one of which was pollution. The topic is close to my heart, because my mother has asthma bronchitis so I did many stories about pollution, particularly one about the conflicting plans of Punjab, Haryana, Delhi and the central government and how there\u2019s just no uniformity, because of the power dynamics and politics.\nAnother story was about the Rohingya crisis. I was anchoring the morning show till 4pm. After my hours in the office, I went and shot on my own with a mobile phone, and in my own car. I found the Rohingya refugee camp in Delhi and was not aware that it was just seven kilometers from NDTV office. It broke my heart but that story became a part of the investigation for a show called Truth Vs Hype. I did it on my own, without telling anyone about it. It became a solid story which the UN looked at and offered me a fellowship and because of that I was in New York for three months, which then led to Columbia because they liked that story so much.\nThen there was another story about what I think is going on right now is the information war, where politicians weaponize information and misinformation, fake news and all of that. That was a story about Cambridge Analytica that I did. It was perhaps the biggest news break, because it made headlines across the country. I was the first person to break news. I was in Goa, partying and flew back because I got the information that this is happening and I got the document that was needed. It was about how Cambridge Analytica\u2019s boss had met Congress leaders and so I got that story out. After that I produced a show called India vs Fake news. Our managing editor Sonia in January of 2019 did this town hall where they were trying to get ideas of how we should approach our election coverage.\nI suggested that the election was not about human studies anymore. We had done that incessantly for decades. This was also not going to be about elections around religion. This is going to be about fake news, and whatsapp consumption and how everyone\u2019s taking that information through whatsapp and minds are being influenced in terms of voting, so we had to approach it in that direction. So the next day we started the show and I was very proud of the way we did that, without a team, without an output editor to build rundowns, without any help. But of all of those I think the one that stands out for me is January 6, insurrection when I was alone and I walked into the US Capitol with Trump supporters looking down at me with a turban and wondering why I was there and I just understood that India is not all that bad maybe (laughs). I saw that the US is in a much worse off place when it comes to the impact of false news, fake information, misinformation and disinformation. It made me realize that we\u2019re a very divided society across the world and in every country and that\u2019s the way people in power like to keep it, because that is the only way you can control things. That broke me and I\u2019ve kind of been mostly figuring out what to do about that, since then.\nIndian Journalist, New York Journalists, Columbia Political Journalists, Upcoming Journalists\u2026\nJournalist, Presenter, Political reporter, Sikh, Writer, Columbia Journalism School, South Asian Journalists\u2026www.amitojsingh.org\nWhat are the challenges you faced while doing your coverages?\nSingh: That is a tricky one. I think in the grand scheme of things I didn\u2019t face that much discrimination and later I realized that that\u2019s not got to do with the fact that I am uniquely identified but perhaps more because of privileges of education I had of the institutional nepotism that happens when you are from the Doon school in India. There\u2019s a kind of cultural, social, nepotism that goes on because there is technically something wrong with it, but when you have a capitalistic competitive news system, you don\u2019t have time to nurture people who may have more potential than me, and so you got to really have people who are already kind of in the scene. You don\u2019t have to mould them and nurture them and nourish them and mentor them and teach them. You\u2019re already halfway there and it makes life a lot easier. I think, to some extent, this is my conjecture, I can\u2019t prove it, but I do believe that in the first three years, four years, maybe in the first seven years of my NDTV career for several other reasons, but also, I wanted to do everything, report, to be on air. I think in every corporate space you\u2019ve got to do that if you don\u2019t do it nobody\u2019s going to give you a chance, like one of the things I learned is that if you don\u2019t ask you don\u2019t get anything. So even though I was informed about cricket I think some of my team members and my leadership didn\u2019t give me the opportunity, I deserved fast enough, and there were reasons because perhaps the people in it were good enough already. So they did not really need another person, but also because there was a bit of a question mark about my appearance, they were not sure about putting a sardar (Sikh man wearing turban) on air. I had to make some changes to my appearances like one of the things that I used to do when I came to NDTV, I had a longer beard, I had not trimmed my beard. I wore a turban in a very untidy manner, not a smart way. When I got to know that I\u2019d be anchoring the week that was coming up, I remember going to my maternal uncle who was in the army. He ties the turban very beautifully. I woke him up at five o\u2019clock in the morning and made him teach me how to tie the smartest turban possible because I was now an ambassador for this identity that I had as a child, which I didn\u2019t think I am the flag bearer of but I was born into the family so that\u2019s who I am. I felt I didn\u2019t want to let anyone down and particularly NDTV. I didn\u2019t want anyone to say that a Sardar is on air and he\u2019s not looking good. I wanted it to be exactly the opposite, and so I made a bit of an effort that time and asked myself several questions and did some soul searching, and chose to trim my beard because it didn\u2019t make sense to spend like an hour every day, trying to keep your beard tidy.\nI went on air and it was great because by that time I just knew the system so well.\nThere was a lot to learn. Former Australian cricketer and commentator Dean Jones was on my first show. It was an IPL match I think and after my first show, we hit the commercials and I remember he said something that I will never forget, and I thank him for that, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s not how you start, but how you end.\u201d\nThat\u2019s how people remember you, so you have to be as good as you started to end the show so I kept up that intensity of my energy in my presentation. Anchoring a show can be very tiresome. Those were half an hour shows and by the time I was doing four hours of news anchoring non-stop that too breaking news sometimes.\nAfter that one of my bosses sent an email saying, \u201c This is one of the best shows I have ever seen from a first time news anchor.\u201d\nAnd there was this other anchor colleague who told me to remember that it is always about confidence and that the camera is my best friend. I literally maintained that because my style of doing news was very informal, casual almost, but official. It was a combination that people started noticing and I used to see these tweets and posts on Facebook about me. I got messages from people in Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the US on Facebook more than I got in India. Somebody did an article on me Sikhs who have carved their unique identity or something like that on Times of India or Indian Express or something and then another colleague and me had chosen for best dressed anchors or news journalists in the country and I took pride in those things because I felt that there is a stereotyping of Sikhs in India and perhaps across the world. In a Hollywood movie we are taxi drivers and in Indian cinema, we are not good enough, as Sikhs originally to be Sikhs for hero roles and all the Khans and the Kumar\u2019s take those roles and dress up as Sikhs and make their bucks. I say have you ever seen a Sardar, he\u2019s very energetic and is cool. Why don\u2019t you use an original Sardar, for your shows and movies? Why do you have to always present us as either angry, either stupid, funny or brave. These are the 4 identities of Sikhs that are potrayed. There is a fifth one too, the journalist identity. No one notices that.\nThis categorization that I was very against. And so when Diljit Dosanjh (famous Punjabi singer from India) came into the picture with his movies and songs wearing his turban. I was very happy because he broke that stereotype.\nSo this is happening across the country, but even now, when you look at it there\u2019s a lot of stereotypical behavior around Sikhs. I was in Delaware for the Democratic National Convention during the pandemic in the US, and this is in the middle of the afternoon across the parking lot next to the Convention Center. This guy with two children shouted out to me while I was wearing a turban, \u201cHey, can you come here, or something like that, like he felt the need to randomly reach out to a stranger and the entitlement to be able to say to me because I\u2019m used to it perhaps. I realized he was slightly drunk, he was smelling of alcohol, but his children who were with him , he was genuinely making an effort to make them understand who I was. He told me, \u2018 Can you tell them who you are and what is this turban on your head?\u2019 It made me realize that there is a societal shift towards change but it is just so much of this conditioning that it is going to take a long time for it to change. I faced discrimination in the US, particularly during the Black Lives Matter protest after that. The conversation in America has reached a place where they\u2019re recognizing what they have done and it\u2019s very different what they\u2019ve done to the black people as opposed to us, the scales are completely different but hate crimes against Sikhs have been happening forever.\nSo it made me realize a little bit about that and I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s got to do with just America, I think in India it happens all the time. But we are always called with different wierd names and however intelligent we might be, they will always say to us certain things that cannot be true for all of us. So it\u2019s a bit annoying and frankly speaking, if you look at India, the community that is the most prosperous is Sikhs and so it is perplexing. You will never find a beggar in Punjab but when I went to the US, it made me realize that it\u2019s way too big of a problem and Sikhs are really behind. The media is greatly responsible for this. People behind the TV, people responsible for what is viewed by the world are responsible because they don\u2019t put a person on it with a Hijab, they will always make the Taliban\u2019s turban look like terrorists\u2019. They will allow for a certain stereotypical recognition of what is an ideal news reporter or presenter rather than allowing for diversity to flourish with the power of television. Once you normalize us like every other day identity by putting us on TV and not presenting every Muslim in a Hollywood film as a terrorist you\u2019re going to change everything and for me that\u2019s very powerful. So, I try to find a job by making that argument, by telling people look, you\u2019re not going to get a Sikh as good as me. I have the education and I have the experience, I\u2019ve got what you needed from Columbia now. What\u2019s missing? People talk about diversity and inclusion, but it\u2019s not just shades of color it\u2019s about what people were also on their head or any part of the body. America has more than a million Sikhs, you attorneys who are Sikhs. You have Sikhs everywhere and never has a single Sikh been on air in any news channel, how weird is that? It\u2019s subtle discrimination it\u2019s not like what black people have suffered. Asian American are sort of different even amongst Asian Americans, there is no monolith so many different people inside that term. Issue is that Asia is the biggest continent and what you\u2019re doing is getting all of us together, that is itself a problem. There is just so much it doesn\u2019t end this conversation. This can go on forever. However, I did not face any particular discrimination but during BLM protests there was an opportunity for America to ride that wave of ending discrimination against every community. And so, for me, when I said black lives matter what I mean is that there was due attention given to the African American Community but, seven, eight months later, there was this Asian American hate crime, there were a few incidents against them and they are continuing and that then became the topic of conversation. It just surfaced for me because of the movement where you learn through the inspiration of BLM through the hard work of the people behind BLM to understand what it means to be accepted on equal footing, the difference between equity and equality. When you understand that and how to take ownership of it, and then vocalize that and advocate for it and educate people about it and then believe it yourself, like the caste system in India it\u2019s not something that people start talking about. It\u2019s still underground and not mainstream conversation. It\u2019s changing, there\u2019s the shift which is a quiet one and it\u2019s not a vocal shift. It\u2019s happening without a noise about it that says that this is wrong.\nWe as a society need to stop it, that\u2019s not happening! Black lives matter was a moment of awareness, for me, when I realized that, why is it that we or anyone with a different identity is discriminated against are not vocalizing. It should be more about democratic equality and that is what the Indian Constitution reads, which is equality for all people.\nAmitoj Singh covered the BLM protests taking on roles of a reporter and a producer.\nHow was the experience of covering so many different beats, how easy or tough was it and how did you blend in?\nSingh: It was easy because professionalism across the world is a little bit higher than in India. So when you go as a reporter there\u2019s a very mechanical process that you have to follow and things are somewhat made easy for you to report. There isn\u2019t the shoe leather work that is needed to be done in India or at least the countries that I have gone and done reportage. I\u2019ve only been to Malaysia, Australia, New Zealand, England, Germany, Switzerland, the US, and Sri Lanka.\nAll of these countries, most of them were for sporting coverage. Like Australia was for sports, but then I covered, other news like the murder of an Indian woman. They are much more responsive and answerable to the media and so you don\u2019t have to go around chasing the people in power. I think one time I faced discrimination again and it was difficult and I will explain why because there\u2019s a certain way in which they consider Indian journalists in Australia, for example, they looked down upon us, because some of the Indian journalists come out there and really showcase themselves to be poor journalists and so there is like this impression about us. Like one of the people in cricket Australia once said something demeaning to me and I had to let him know in his own language what he was doing wrong publicly because he said what he had to say to me publicly and it was a reminder to him that just because some engage in low quality journalism, doesn\u2019t mean most of us do. I think the US was uniquely different because the US has a huge undercurrent of the whole immigrant narrative coming in and taking over parts and so it was difficult to reach out to random people on the ground and talk to them, not New Yorkers because they are cool but like somebody in Texas once I called him and they said something like, \u2018..why don\u2019t you go back?\u2019 I asked the question and obviously my accent was heard by the person and he realized I was not American and he instead of answering the question I had asked, he said this and put down the phone. Those kinds of things happen but the differences I\u2019d say was a recognition of how so many different cultures, even if they\u2019re all white people, are so different. In Sri Lanka, for example, it was beautiful because people were just amazing, covering stories were easy. In Australia, it was like they would look at you with a bit of suspicion, particularly when you\u2019re wearing a turban but smile at you because people are now being asked to be more hospitable. And it\u2019s like what I always say, this is like point 00.1% of what a woman goes through. I\u2019d say in America it was similar wherein on Halloween and Times Square, I was wearing a turban and I had another Sardar friend with me who\u2019s also wearing a turban and we were wearing kurta pajama (traditional attire of the Sikhs). People thought we were literally going for a random Indian party on Halloween and considered we were not Sikhs but people who are dressed up as Sikhs but they didn\u2019t even know what Sikhs are and what a Turban is. International coverage was not a problem, like the World Economic Forum, the UN was great. Sometimes wearing the turban or being an Indian journalist helped.\nI didn\u2019t get myself down and dirty like journalists now in Ukraine would have to do. That would be something I\u2019d like to hear about because mine was more like a planned experience. I was at the UN. It\u2019s a process, it\u2019s systematic journalism there. The best conferences are held at noon, where we make an interview request by email. It\u2019s not shoe-leather reporting. Similarly in Switzerland, I was there at Davos, which is the same, and then there was this Swiss Government sponsored trip, which again where everything was made available to us so it wasn\u2019t like my hard work and toil. It\u2019s only like later that I did the kind of international journalism, wherein I went to Iraq and I had to do everything myself in a sense, even though I had a fixer who knew the language and was connected, I made an extra effort and did real journalism, instead of just do what a channel needs because this was not something a channel required. This was my thesis, I had to write 20,000 words and I wanted to write it in a particular way, so I had to do it in the best possible way. I went really deep down into the story, and obviously the resources provided by international news organizations, the time that they give in, the thought process that goes into a story is just unbelievable. I remember, the Master\u2019s thesis I wrote was six months in the making but I used to sometimes go on air in seven minutes over a big news break and just start rattling. Bosses would call me and just say go on air and I had to ask what the story was but they would be telling me in my ear through the talkback after I sat down to anchor. I had that confidence which no other reporter had. I had developed a knack of understanding, very quickly, what a story was. In the US that doesn\u2019t work because you got to be the boss of your story inside out . Even in Australia you need to know the story but particularly so in the U.S they will ask you twenty questions about it, before the story is aired which tells you a little bit about the rigorous story development that takes place and that\u2019s the difference.\nAmitoj Singh covering the Yazidi women in Iraq as a part of his thesis work for the Columbia University.\nWhat did you cover in Iraq and how was it different from the other coverages that you have done?\nSingh: Completely different but it was as close to the Rohingya story that I was earlier talking about but even worse. My sister\u2019s children, I am close to them and around the time that I chose this topic was because I was just perplexed about how this could happen to children and how this world could allow this to happen to them. What happened was that, there is a certain community in northern Iraq the Yazidis are a minority community. They have been victims of genocide, since centuries wherein they are thought of as an evil population, for some reason, because they pray to a certain God and I found it uniquely interesting because what happened was when ISIS attacked Iraq and took over Mosul and in June of 2014 or 15 and then took over the Northern other parts, they took Yazidi women as slaves. First they took all the men, lined them up, shot and killed them, children included, young boys and then took the women and made them sexual slaves, after kidnapping them, sold them as sexual slaves, retained some of them, married them with the wives they already had. They also raped them and impregnated and kept them as cleaners in their own house. The children that they had were the children of Sunni ISIS terrorists and Yazidi women which is a problem when ISIS was defeated, because the Yazidi community did not want to take children who are born to ISIS men. So the mothers suffered incredibly because not only had they gone through this ordeal, but they had also landed themselves up in a position where their own families did not want to take the children with them. So for me that was really heartbreaking and these children were orphans and it was disastrous. It broke my heart and I went and met three women who told me their story and how they were still not united with their children. Then I went to the political leaders of that region, I went to the religious leaders of that religion, and all kinds of different people including NGO\u2019s who are trying to work on this and other people who were trying to rediscover or rather find the mass graves of the Yazidi people. It was just a very traumatic experience as a journalist. That\u2019s a story that is clearly the one that has stood out for me and that\u2019s not published yet. I have still not been able to get it out.\nDid you ever talk to anyone about getting it published or are you still in the process?\nSingh: In fact, one or two organizations wanted to publish it but one of the things that most media organizations are doing now is cutting the story short. I don\u2019t want to cut this one short. They want to publish 2000 words. I\u2019ve written 18,000 words. I shot in on a mobile so it is like a complete package and there\u2019s something I don\u2019t want to compromise on.\nDo you want to use it as a book or something sometime?\nSingh: I\u2019m not qualified for that to be honest, I don\u2019t speak the language, I am not an Iraq-based journalist. I was just like a parachute journalist who walked in and did a story, and so I don\u2019t feel like I should do that. But eventually I want to do something out of it, I just want to do it right now.\nYou attended journalism school when you were, I think 33. Does it change the way you see things?\nSingh: It does. NDTV was a broadcast journalism space, it was completely oriented toward broadcast and, yes, post 2014 we were as reporters professionally asked to become writers, so we had to first publish for the website before we did the TV story and that did help a lot for me because the course that I chose a Columbia turned out to be completely disproportionately focused on long form narrative writing which I didn\u2019t imagine when I went into it. I thought it would be a bit of a balance and though it said that this is a course meant for long form narrative writing, I thought they\u2019d accommodate a little bit of the TV space or fast breaking news stories, which I didn\u2019t do because both the professors who are leading that particular course where book writers or long form piece writers. One was a New Yorker staff writer, and the other has written 108 books and that didn\u2019t help because when they were upcoming journalists people still had the interest in reading as TV had not flourished so much and by the time we became journalists the attention span was six seconds, even shorter now. For me that was a bit problematic and initially I wasn\u2019t learning a lot at Columbia, I thought and felt that I had been shortchanged. I had spent 12 years by then as a journalist, and NDTV really teaches you a lot so I felt like I knew so much, but it\u2019s the way you think and how you choose every single word to say what you want to say and articulate what you what what is the news as closely to the truth, as you can with the word that you\u2019ve chosen ,that art is what Columbia teaches. First three or four months, I was a bit surprised at Columbia but then over a period of time it kind of sunk in that here\u2019s what the learning has been and I do believe that Columbia as a school probably needs to redesign that course because it\u2019s highly disproportionately leaning towards a medium of information consumption that less and less people are consuming.\nYou want to be able to be the master of a medium of information or news or factual truth telling that is the most consumed as opposed to the least. When you have one minute to tell a story, you know the problem, because you can\u2019t tell the story in one minute.\n\nWhat do you do with Coindesk now and how is that different from what you have done so far?\nSingh: I am the regulatory reporter for CoinDesk. I\u2019m covering India, mostly, but also every other part of the world, depending on the story and whether I have sources on that story and an interest. CoinDesk is New York based. It is the longest and perhaps easily most respected cryptocurrency news outlet in the world. My current colleagues are from Bloomberg, Washington Post and Wall Street Journal so a mix of people from the best finance journalism are all working together as a part of an amazing team. I\u2019m covering the position that the government is taking on cryptocurrency in India, Pakistan, Singapore, Dubai, Ukraine, Russia, all of that. How is it different? Well, for one, I\u2019m not going to the office, so I am my own shepherd in a sense, because I don\u2019t have an immediate boss over me. So I have to motivate myself, I have to dig out the stories, pick the stories myself. Sometimes, or rather, mostly I do them without even pitching it to my editor. I am mostly on the phone, building sources, building the name for CoinDesk. So I\u2019m not just responsible for the reportage, but also for being the ambassador of the organization in India. I don\u2019t have to do television news. So it gives me more time to write slightly more nuanced stories and be very well informed about a story before I write it or deliver it as in a new cycle, which was not the case in broadcast. Sometimes in broadcast due to immediacy, we had only 20% of the information that we needed to write to do a story and we will have to go with it which would often lead to a less nuanced story presentation. So it was further from the truth than you would like it to be, but faster. Here, it\u2019s slightly slower. But it\u2019s much closer to the truth, the nuanced truth that is. But most importantly, I think it is different because I was earlier a sports journalist and a political journalist. Like in the year 2013- 14, I was a sports journalist, then between 2013 and 2015, I was at the intersection of sports and politics, covering the BCCI. And then for the last six years, I was basically a geopolitical journalist, covering elections and a lot more like misinformation. Now I\u2019m covering the financial world. So crypto is like my vehicle to get into the financial world of journalism. And that\u2019s why this is very different. And the financial world of journalism requires you to be like this entire beast on its own. Like in politics, you have different political parties here, you have different companies. And they\u2019re all sharks who are important in their own way, and much more organized than political parties. And the information flow is much more. And it\u2019s a lot about numbers and money. And so you have to dig deeper. And you don\u2019t necessarily need to land up at a rally because there are no rallies. So it\u2019s not about what voters are saying. It\u2019s about what numbers are saying. And that\u2019s very important. For this you need to develop an expertise of a different kind. So it\u2019s just more laptop time and less camera time.\nWhat is that one advice you would give to future journalists?\nSingh: Believe in the power of truth even if it appears to not be enough in changing voters mindsets or bringing change. Your role though is not to change the voter\u2019s mindsets. Your role is to fearlessly find the truth and talk about it. That\u2019s why people entrust you with their voice. Honor it.\nQ and A by Kingkini Sengupta, republished on Reynolds Sansbox", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 0, "created_time": 1651689704822, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["International Journalism", "Mediatips", "Rsjlab"]}, {"author": "Reynolds Sandbox", "post_id": "24b2097f3766", "user_id": "c06313253d64", "title": "A Journalist Who Knows No Borders: One of Reno\u2019s Own", "content": "A Journalist Who Knows No Borders: One of Reno\u2019s Own\nKaeli Britt conducts a Q&A with Natalie Van Hoozer, a cross-border journalist and translator, to learn more about her journey towards her current career; how the University of Nevada, Reno, served as a stepping stone; and what advice she can offer to students looking to pursue translation or international journalism work.\nNatalie Van Hoozer presenting at the SembraMedia entrepreneurial journalism conference in Lima, Peru, in 2018, alongside her colleagues from Mexico, Chile and the Dominican Republic. | Photo courtesy of Natalie Van Hoozer\nNatalie Van Hoozer found her passion for bilingual, cross-cultural journalism as a student through an internship with KUNR public radio.\n\u201cI started with them in 2016 and I worked \u2026 as an intern from 2016\u20132018 during my time at the Reynolds School,\u201d Van Hoozer said of the launch to her bilingual career. \u201cThat experience allowed me to gain practice experiencing bilingual content in both English and Spanish in the KUNR newsroom, alongside professional journalists which was a valuable experience.\u201d\n\u201cWe were really experimenting and learning how to conduct interviews in both languages, what the production process looked like, how those things would translate to an audio story and social media,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was a lot of experimentation that shaped my early career in working in two languages \u2014 specifically, Spanish and English.\u201d\nVan Hoozer\u2019s early experimentation with a wide variety of media production opportunities helped her to further explore her passion with bilingual media in terms of its overall development.\n\u201cWhen I graduated from UNR, I didn\u2019t go into traditional reporting and production. I moved to Washington, D.C., where I worked as a programming assistant at the International Center For Journalists,\u201d Van Hoozer said.\nNatalie Van Hoozer hosting a virtual event in Spanish for KUNR Public Radio in 2021. | Photo courtesy of Terri Van Hoozer\n\u201cI was able to then work with journalists in an informed way because I knew what their process was like and what they would need from an organization supporting them with grants, reporting training, continuous support, security training, things like that,\u201d she said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t working full time in media production, even though I did do some journalism on the side, writing different articles, teaching a podcast class for a university in Mexico.\u201d\nVan Hoozer kept herself busy and lengthened her portfolio by doing all of these side jobs, while still doing other international journalism work with the International Center For Journalists.\n\u201cI did all of that work in addition to my full time job at the International Center For Journalists and working at ICFJ, as it\u2019s known by its acronym, I worked with journalists from around the world, especially in Latin America and the Caribbean, and with that I expanded my understanding and experience of what it\u2019s like to work with journalists across borders and in different time zones, different continents,\u201d Van Hoozer said. \u201cAs part of my work, I did get to travel, so I traveled to Latin America, on occasion, specifically to Mexico and the Dominican Republic, where I facilitated media trainings for journalists.\u201d\nAn overview of the five priorities highlighted by the International Center For Journalists, as described on their website. | Infographic by Kaeli Britt\n\u201cWorking in media development is a great way to get involved in international journalism and see what international work might interest you, so it\u2019s a good way to get a sample of what it\u2019s like working for journalists in Mexico or the Dominican Republic, or Argentina, or Spain, or anywhere really. You can see what the day-to-day life is like for those journalists through supporting them with a media nonprofit,\u201d she said.\nAt the Reynolds School, as a journalism major, there is already an internship requirement necessary to complete your degree, however expanding research to fellowships and other opportunities can also serve as great additional experiences, something that Van Hoozer agrees with.\n\u201cLook for ways to start working with international organizations before you even leave the U.S. In my case, that\u2019s what I had been doing as a student at the Reynolds School,\u201d Van Hoozer said. \u201cWhen I was at UNR, I was working with international organizations, including SembraMedia, which is a media nonprofit that supports media entrepreneurs and media startups, especially with an emphasis on Spanish-language media in the U.S., Spain, and Latin America. I was working with that organization, as well as contributing to places like the International Journalists Network Blog, before I\u2019d even graduated college.\u201d\nFor Van Hoozer, graduating college and already having a varied amount of experience under her belt from a young age definitely offered up impressive opportunities.\n\u201cI was selected as a Fulbright English Teaching Assistant in March of 2019, but because of the school calendar in Argentina, my program didn\u2019t start until the beginning of March 2020,\u201d she recounted. \u201cI arrived in Buenos Aires March 9, 2020, right before the pandemic really escalated. I was supposed to be in Northern Argentina, in the town of Chilecito, in the province La Rioja, for eight months, but I never made it. My cohort did a few days of orientation in Buenos Aires and then we started a quarantine in apartments in Buenos Aires, then after that, the program was ended by Fulbright and we all needed to return to the U.S.\u201d\nDespite the pause that Van Hoozer dealt with, similar to the rest of the world during the beginning of the pandemic, she was able to continue her international work right from the comfort of her home here in Reno.\n\u201cWith my experience, when I came back to Reno I was reporting on the international impacts of the pandemic from my bedroom,\u201d Van Hoozer said. \u201cI wrote articles for the International Journalists Network as a contributing reporter, one of which I interviewed journalists in Italy, Mexico, and the U.S. about what it was like to be reporting as freelancers at the beginning of the pandemic.\u201d\nPrior to her unfortunately short lived trip to Argentina, Van Hoozer was also given the opportunity to work at the International Center for Journalists in Washington D.C. and expanded on her project and planning management skills.\n\u201cI worked with the International Center for Journalists in Washington D.C. from Sept 2018 to February 2020 as a Program Assistant,\u201d she said. \u201cI took that experience and working at ICFJ, I added program management and event planning skills as areas of expertise. Now, as a journalist, working more in a traditional sense again, I\u2019m working as a community engagement reporter in addition to reporting bilingually in English and Spanish and I\u2019m also the lead reporter on grant-funded projects. I\u2019m using those programming management skills as a reporter, now that events and engagement are a large part of what journalists can do these days.\u201d\nGoing back to her roots, Van Hoozer continues to work with and for KUNR as a bilingual journalist, utilizing all of her skills from her prior job and academic opportunities.\n\u201cI am continuing with those projects with KUNR Public Radio where I\u2019m a bilingual contributing reporter as well as KUNR\u2019s Community Engagement Coordinator,\u201d Van Hoozer said. \u201cMy work at ICFJ and at KUNR have both required me to continue using my Spanish skills, as well and to continue improving them as I work with more people in different capacities.\u201d\nNatalie Van Hoozer interviewing a day laborer in Spanish on Galletti Way in Reno, Nevada in 2016. | Photo courtesy of Jos\u00e9 Olivares\n\u201cI knew from very early in my time at UNR and in the Reynolds School that I wanted to incorporate Spanish-language reporting into my journalism career because it was obvious pretty quickly to me that even in Northern Nevada alone, even if you\u2019re just looking at our region, there is a need for more Spanish-language journalism,\u201d she said.\nHer passion for journalism, but also for learning more about Spanish cultures in order to provide better context for translations, is something that goes back to Van Hoozer\u2019s days at the University of Nevada, Reno.\n\u201cDouble majoring in journalism and Spanish let me learn the necessary skills on the Spanish side, to be able to interview community members in Spanish, when that was the language that was most comfortable for them,\u201d Van Hoozer said. \u201cThat\u2019s always been something very gratifying for me because that\u2019s when you get the most heartfelt, honest answers \u2014 when people aren\u2019t inhibited by language or other barriers, so I wanted to be able to offer people that.\u201d\nVan Hoozer\u2019s attention and care for detail when it comes to translation has also opened the doors for her in other realms of Spanish-language media in the United States.\n\u201cI also work as a Partnerships and Community Engagement Strategist with Fact Chequalo, which is a Spanish-language media organization dedicated to fact-checking Spanish-language content and news in the U.S.,\u201d she said.\nAlongside traditional journalism, Van Hoozer also works on creating centers for various media organizations working towards fact-checking Spanish content and other news in order for production in the United States. Since she is well versed in several different areas of bilingual, Spanish-language, journalism, Van Hoozer takes on a range of projects as an independent journalist.\n\u201cAs an independent journalist, I do contract based translation work, which varies from project to project,\u201d Van Hoozer said. \u201cThe majority of this work is Spanish to English, because my dominant language is English and I\u2019ve learned Spanish, so that\u2019s the advice traditionally for translators (translating to your dominant language).\u201d\nRather than spending a day in a newsroom, writing stories all day, she has multiple tasks relating to translation and interpretation in the media production realm.\n\u201cOn a daily basis, I\u2019ll be writing bilingual emails, interpreting from Spanish to English during meetings, and publishing bilingual social media content, in addition to publishing stories in both English and Spanish,\u201d she said.\nExpanding on her unique experiences, she was also able to interview a social media/Tik Tok star, where Van Hoozer also utilized the opportunity to show off her translation and interpretation skills.\n\u201cI also hosted an interview with Dave Jorgenson, who is known as The Washington Post Tik Tok Guy, and for that I collected questions in Spanish from the audience because this was a virtual conference run by an organization in Mexico,\u201d Van Hoozer said. \u201cIn real time, I translated those questions into English, so that I could ask Dave those questions during our conversation in English.\u201d\nTranslation typically refers to written content, while interpretation alludes to spoken language in real time.\n\u201cSo, translation and interpretation work present themselves in a variety of ways for bilingual reporters who choose to work in both languages,\u201d she said.\nTranslations can sometimes be difficult from a subjective standpoint, which is why international journalists often have studied another language, or are fluent in multiple languages.\n\u201cI love that creating an authentic translation requires so much more than understanding vocabulary or grammar,\u201d Van Hoozer said. \u201cIt requires you to immerse yourself in the culture that you\u2019re trying to translate.\u201d\nMore than just studying another language, accurate translations necessitate a proper follow through of every detail that is being said for an interpreter to translate, especially in real time.\n\u201cThe key thing with these activities that do require translation and interpretation is to make sure the essence and the tone of the original content is coming through in the translation,\u201d she said. \u201cI love trying to constantly better my translations by finding the right expressions in English to capture the ideas that I\u2019m trying to convey from Spanish.\u201d\nFurther, actively working on going back and forth between languages is another way to work on translation and interpretation skills.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re interested in working in international journalism or media development, in addition to finding those international opportunities before you\u2019ve even stepped outside of the U.S., I\u2019d encourage you to build your skills in a second or third language even if you\u2019re not at a native speaker level,\u201d Van Hoozer said. \u201cSeek out translation and interpretation opportunities to practice going back and forth between languages.\u201d\nFor those who are interested in starting international journalism and/or translation work, Van Hoozer suggests finding international projects to work on, even if travel isn\u2019t offered at certain positions, or travel isn\u2019t available.\n\u201cAbove all, be curious and look for ways to work on projects that transcend borders, even if you aren\u2019t able to travel physically, which has definitely been the case in these times of pandemic,\u201d she said. \u201cI had my experience working at the ICFJ in Washington D.C. and all of that allowed me to continue working internationally, even when the pandemic forced me to come home from Argentina much earlier than anticipated.\u201d\nAlthough the COVID-19 pandemic has changed many facets of society and challenged what people once considered as normal, the scope of international journalism has opened and branched a bit away from traditional international journalism work. Now, people can do reporting on international issues from their own local community.\n\u201cBecause of how virtual everything can be, there\u2019s possibilities to work internationally even when travel has been complicated these past years,\u201d Van Hoozer recommended. \u201cI encourage anyone who wants to start to seek out those opportunities, look for international organizations, fellowships, grants that will plug you into these communities of international journalists and media organizations.\u201d\nQ and A reporting by Kaeli Britt for the Reynolds Sandbox", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 0, "created_time": 1651678733784, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Bilingual Journalism", "Mediatips", "Rsjlab", "Humans Of Reno"]}, {"author": "Reynolds Sandbox", "post_id": "58c626c7aeb0", "user_id": "c06313253d64", "title": "Ruby Jo Barrientos, An Artivist in Reno", "content": "Ruby Jo Barrientos, An Artivist in Reno\nJarrette Werk, Aaniiih and Nakoda, photographs Ruby Jo Barrientos and some of her art, while interviewing her on how her lived experiences as a first-generation Salvadoran American influence her art.\n\nSelf-taught visual artist Ruby Jo Barrientos uses her artwork to bring attention to social inequities such as the erasure of Salvadoran Mayan culture and how geopolitical dynamics forced people, like her family, to migrate to the United States.\nThe youngest of five daughters, her family immigrated from El Salvador in the late 1970s as refugees from the country\u2019s civil war, eight years before she was born.

Is it good or bad; a force for self-sacrifice and unity, or one of militant tribalism and aggression? What is the fate of nationalism in a globalized world \u2014 will it live on, peter out, or even be revived and take vengeance on globalization?\nLet us see how the world\u2019s best thinkers on nations and nationalism have approached the topic. Rummaging through my own book shelves I found at least 20 different ways to approach it. I\u2019ll quickly overview all of these.\nIn a follow-up article, I will sketch a desirable role for nationalism in a planetary world truly worth fighting for.\nWe can imagine worlds without borders, we can dream of heavens that unite us all, our planet viewed from space\u2014but at the end of the line, the strongest social force to ever explode on this planet is the nation. Astronauts, cosmonauts, and taikonauts, despite their claims to seeing the world as one, a \u201ca blue marble in space with no borders\u201d and so on, are indeed so much part of nationalist projects that the very title of their profession varies according to national loyalties.\nThat doesn\u2019t make the nation eternal, or always good. But it means we\u2019d be foolish to underestimate it. It\u2019s a force we must understand so as to creatively and sensitively guide it towards universal and ethical ends.\nNationalism: The Strongest Social Force?\nOn a very basic level, most observers agree that nationalism \u2014 in theory \u2014 can be harnessed for both ethically viable and pathological purposes. As a social dynamic, it is the same as what we call \u201cpatriotism\u201d; it\u2019s just that we tend to call it patriotism when it\u2019s attributed to the perceived underdog and/or when the actions it brings about are viewed as positive. People get swept away in collective effervescence and pride, giving blood, toil, and tears for the national or patriot cause.\nAnd then after the \u201cgreat historical events\u201d, there is a sense of shared pride for the nation, a belonging, a characteristic form of deep sorrow of how we suffered through this. The American Spirit is not found in \u201cartificial Americana\u201d of Hollywood teenage movies, but in the solemn, rugged freedom you feel walking across an old bridge of its glory industrial age, listening to the blues, encountering the lonely vastness of the Great Plains or the Rockies, and hearing the dreams of young people and how they take it as their birthright to try to pave their own life paths. There is a romantic feeling to it that cannot be transmitted other than by being in the country for at least a period of time, by knowing the people, the environments, feeling its history. As foreigners, we can get little premonitions of the national pride of the USA, of the passionate but desperate absurdity known by the French folk spirit and its scent of revolution, of the grim Slavic sorrow of Russia, suffering and struggling from Ivan the Terrible, to the \u201cGreat Patriotic War\u201d (WWII) and the collapse of the Soviet Union. Like lovers, we tend to believe, at least on some level, that the nationalist sentiments tied to our own country are the strongest ones. But the art of ethnography and cultural perspective-taking can relieve us of such illusions: The national love stories of others are stronger than we can imagine. As Westerners, we are only now waking up to the force of nationalism in China and India.\nHistory, language, music, art, food, and customs meld into one pattern \u2014 and this pattern is linked to a monopoly of violence. Given this \u201clayered\u201d nature of nationalism, it is as the depths of the sea: Invisible at the surface level. You need to dive into the depth of a collective psyche to see it, to feel it. It\u2019s alive, and it\u2019s always powerful, because it\u2019s always sad, and it\u2019s always proud \u2014 even if the pride may be a wounded one. When it rises from the depths, it can come as salvation, as ecstasy, as sudden unification, as unfettered rage, as terror, as genocide, as total war.\nIndividually, nationalism is not the strongest social force in the lives of most of us \u2014 we care much more about our personal life stories and of our families than about countries and nation states. But think about it: It\u2019s the only social force that can involve millions of people and that people can be be prepared to kill and die for. Millions of people wouldn\u2019t die for your life story or your family. Only you would. So it\u2019s because a lot of people care not-so-little about the same thing that it\u2019s such a strong force. In statistical mechanics, an average flow of a trillion particles will explain the events of the world better than the bouncing back and forth of any one particular particle. If ten million people in a certain geographical area simultaneously feel a bit of shame and respond with a bit of rage \u2014 but, individually, less so than if they had personally been slighted by a neighbor \u2014 what happens? A force is unleashed that spells murder and mayhem upon anything that comes in their way. Can big corporations truly compete with that power, even in our global days? Last I heard, McDonald\u2019s is becoming \u201cUncle Vanya\u201d in wartime Russia.\nMost of us have a negative connotation to the word \u201cnationalism\u201d (although a growing minority on the right tend to disagree) and a positive connotation to the word \u201cpatriotism\u201d (although some of our leftwing friends might disagree). Just like one man\u2019s terrorist can be another\u2019s freedom fighter, one\u2019s chauvinist nationalism can be another\u2019s patriotism.\nTo note this is not to say we are stuck with relativism. Although relativist stances can initially help us challenge our own biases, they offer no moral compass, and so they tend to inadvertently lead to a \u201cmight is right\u201d perspective \u2014 as many critics have noted. So, even without accepting the na\u00efve division into \u201cgood\u201d patriotism and \u201cbad\u201d nationalism, we can be committed to using the forces of nationalism for good, to the best of our capacities of compassion and moral reason.\nIf nationalism is both terrible and wonderful, let us at least approach it with multiple perspectives, and try to get a rich and nuanced view of it. We cannot know what the fate of nationalism will be, but we can be almost certain that it will continue to play pivotal roles at key moments of world history. Ukraine is seeing the birth of a proud nation with more patriotic citizenry, perhaps even capable of curbing its history of corruption; those observers of the conflict from around the world who have wounded national pride at the hands of \u201cthe West\u201d tend to hope to see a Russian victory over Western hegemony; and Russia itself is acting from a nationalist framework, whatever the geostrategic aspects of it may be.\nThere is no understanding the situation we are in without understanding the nature of nationalism. In short, this decisive moment is one of nationalism. As will future moments be. Those that understand this force the best will, perhaps, shape the history of the world the most.\n20 Ways to Understand Nationalism\nThe different perspectives each have their scholarly proponents that I shall also mention. Let me first say two things.\nFirstly, I agree with all of them \u2014 even as they seemingly contradict one another. But I believe their perspectives are \u201ctrue but partial\u201d \u2014 and I believe that seeing all of the perspectives together facilitates a better understanding of the phenomenon. However, simply listing the perspectives doesn\u2019t really make us wiser. Rather, we have to try to see how they compare to one another, how they partially overlap, and how they form parts of a greater, non-arbitrary view of nations and nationalism. It is by seeing the \u201cproperty space\u201d within which the different perspectives arise, and then coordinating the perspectives in a case-sensitive manner, that the secret good nationalism is unlocked.\nSecondly, of course, mentioning the scholars and their work is by no means a claim to discuss any of them exhaustively. I will offer abstracted versions of their views, hopefully skillfully abstracted ones. I will also on occasion bend their terminology or adapt it for the purposes of example of convenience. But it is the fate of the comprehensive social theorist to be a dabbler \u2014 and if I have an anthem I swear by, it\u2019s the dabbler\u2019s tragic and proud way of life.\nLet\u2019s go.\n1. Nationalism, as we think of it today, only emerged fully in the 19th century (Hobsbawm), and did so as a companion to a certain, industrial, mode of production (Gellner)\nEric J. Hobsbawm, one of the greatest historians of the 20th century, wrote Nations and Nationalism since 1780 in which he lays out a detailed account of how the \u201cnation state\u201d in many ways was \u201cinvented\u201d in the 19th century, which involved a significant amount of social engineering on the behalf of rulers and bureaucrats. The nation state is when there is a \u201ccongruence between a political and a national unit\u201d. This is a definition that Hobsbawm draws directly from the philosopher Ernest Gellner, whose 1983 work (also titled Nations and Nationalism) argued that nationalism must be a distinctly \u201cmodern\u201d social phenomenon. Basically, for big economies to function, you must educate wide populations, and that requires a homogenization of language; hence nationalist projects begin to abound.\nWith this view, we must not lose from sight that nationalism is a historical phenomenon, and thus that it arose one time, not so long ago, and that it may shapeshift. Yes, there are older histories of many of our countries, but even these histories were defined and written, often romantically so, in the 19th century, by people who specifically wanted to engender nationalism.\n2. Nationalism consists of two categories of \u201cthe people\u201d: Ethnos and Demos (Bauhn)\nThe distinction between Ethnos and Demos is an invention of my own, detailed in my 2019 book, Nordic Ideology, although it\u2019s a fairly long-hanging fruit. The closest thing I have found is in Swedish philosopher Per Bauhn\u2019s 1995 work, Nationalism and Morality, where he distinguishes between \u201ccivic\u201d and \u201cethnic\u201d nationalism \u2014 and claims that only the former is ethically defensible (a position I feel sympathy for but must ultimately disagree with).\nEthnos is the people in their concrete, organic, customary reality: the Swedes of Sweden, with certain traditions, language, looks, habits, religions, norms, and so forth.\nDemos is the \u201cthe people\u201d qua citizens of a certain political unit: All free men of Athens, all citizens of the Kingdom of Sweden, of the Republic of India, and so forth. As such, you can have any race, religion, etc. as long as you are in a relationship of rights and obligations towards the polis, or whichever unit of polity you serve and which serves you. There is a social contract present, in one way or another, and it is of such a universal nature that your particularities cannot and should not make a difference. This is perhaps more the sort of loyalty that de Tocqueville had in mind when he penned his treatise, Democracy in America.\nThe political Right (not the libertarian one) tends to seek to defend the organic Ethnos against the impersonal and mechanical Demos. Adolf Hitler, for instance, specifically argued that the notion of \u201cGerman citizenship\u201d became devoid of meaning if it was not based on being ethnically German.\nThe political Left tends to seek to defend the universality and fairness inherent to inclusion in the Demos against the particularity and favoritism of Ethnos.\nIn reality \u2014 or this is my belief \u2014 neither Ethnos nor Demos can be conclusively destroyed by the other principle, even if they are both always in a state of evolution and change. They must evolve together, and they must be braided as two streams, from the particular, towards the universal, and back again.\n3. Nationalism is an expanded form of tribal community, but not the same as tribalism, and thus a precursor to cosmopolitanism (Harari)\nThe world-famous historian and author of Sapiens, Yuval Noah Harari, notes that, while nations are not the same as tribes, they do after all get people to have solidarity with one another, even millions of complete strangers \u2014 paying taxes, helping each other out, and so forth. As such, Harari seems to situate himself in the \u201cexpanding circles of solidarity\u201d camp: the claim that there is an evolution from solidarity only with oneself or the closest few, to solidarity with a larger tribe, to solidarity with a nation of people who share certain traits, and from there on to solidarity with all people, perhaps even with nature and animals.\nHarari thus means that it would be unwise to vilify nationalism, as it has a \u201cbright side\u201d and can be viewed as one step in the evolution from ego-centrism, to planetary eco-centrism. Without functioning nationalism, many people would lack social security, healthcare, education, protection, and so forth. Thus, don\u2019t try to remove this building block of human solidarity: It is an expanded or abstracted form of tribal community, necessary for yet more expanded and abstracted forms of solidarity to emerge.\n4. Nationalism, or just any ethnic identity, always builds on an us-versus-them logic (Barth)\nThe Norwegian anthropologist Fredrik Barth famously argued that all ethnic \u2014 and thus national \u2014 identities must per definition be based on some negation or opposite. We don\u2019t need a national identity to signify that we are not from Mars (\u201cearthlings\u201d isn\u2019t really an ethnicity). But being French, Indian, or even European all mean something about who we are and who we are not, who we are distinct from.\nIn other words, the whole point of being Danish is that you\u2019re not Swedish. If all people who were Danish were also Swedish (as is the case for people with double citizenship, etc.), Denmark would not exist as a specifically national identity. It would just be a regional flavor of being Swedish (if we assume, then, that all Danes were also Swedes but not vice versa).\nAs such, national opposition is built into the very concept of the nation. All national pride, from history, to language, to sports, to customs, to values, to religion, to economic achievement must have at least some element of us-versus-them.\n5. Nationalism is forged by conflict; the nation-building through war thesis (Sambanis)\nIn extension of the us-versus-them logic is the idea that conflicts bring nations into being; the so-called nation-building through war thesis propagated by, among others, Nicholas Sambanis. The reason Danes aren\u2019t Swedish is because Danes and Swedes fought countless wars, and that the Kingdom of Denmark managed to remain a sovereign state and thus didn\u2019t become Swedish.\nThis is a reversal of the conventional nationalism-leads-to-war wisdom. Conflicts create the need for increased social coherence and in-group solidarity, which incentivizes nation-building endeavors and narratives pertaining to a shared identity and an idea of a \u201cwe\u201d worth dying for.\nThis causal direction has become apparent with the war between Russia and Ukraine. Ukrainian identity wasn\u2019t very strong, especially in the south and east, when the country won its independence in 1991. A large share of the population spoke Russian, not Ukrainian, and elections throughout the period showed how the country was divided between a \u201cUkrainian\u201d west and a \u201cRussian\u201d east. A large share of the population still had a Soviet identity, identifying with the country they were born in. This began to change with the Euromaidan revolution in Kyiv and Russia\u2019s attack on Ukraine in 2014. Over the years, the number of Russian-speaking Ukrainians longing to be ruled from the Kremlin has dwindled, all while a new West-leaning identity has grown stronger, seeing Ukraine as the freedom-loving antithesis to authoritarian Russia. And today, after several months of war, plunder, and genocide, Ukrainian citizens across linguistic barriers have rallied behind the flag while each day of fighting is feeding an ever greater pride in being Ukrainian. I would go as far as saying that we\u2019re witnessing the birth of a nation here.\nIf we look at history, the nation-building through war thesis has a lot of merit: The German nation-state was founded through three successive wars with Denmark, Austria and France. And what would American identity be without their revolution and war against the British? The French without the storm of the Bastille and the following wars with the rest of Europe?\u2014 Sweden without Denmark? Denmark without Sweden? Tom without Jerry, Jerry without Tom? You get the idea.\nThis doesn\u2019t mean that national identities can\u2019t emerge without violence, but the fact remains that wars and revolutions shape our collective identities and that such conflicts tend to remain at the center of our national narratives.\n6. Nationalism is socially constructed (Wendt) and an \u201cimagined community\u201d (Anderson)\nIn the scholarly discipline of \u201cinternational relations\u201d, Alexander Wendt has been a longstanding proponent of \u201csocial constructivism\u201d. This is to say that yes, ethnic identities are always defined in opposition to one another, but then they are also changing depending on how the actions of one\u2019s counterparts are interpreted \u2014 and their actions, of course, depend upon how they interpret \u201cour\u201d actions.\nAs such, national identities, and even whole nation states, can shift dramatically in meaning from one day to the next, simply because of how the actions of other national units are interpreted. Are France and Great Britain humiliating the German people? Let\u2019s get back at them (WW2)! Is Russia invading countries for no good reason? Let\u2019s resist heroically (Ukranians) or join NATO even if it costs us the pride and sovereignty that neutrality lent (Finland and Sweden).\nWendt\u2019s vision is not so far away from that of the anthropologist, Benedict Anderson, who coined the term \u201cimagined communities\u201d. Nations are imagined communities because we cannot, obviously, actually have much to do with most of what our nation states are up to. Oftentimes, we cannot even name the basic bureaucracies, laws, and institutions of our own countries, and yet we really feel we\u2019re part of them. Interesting, isn\u2019t it? We\u2019re imagining things. And then we\u2019re imagining things about other countries too, who we then interpret and feel act towards our own country.\nWithout all of that social construction going on, it\u2019s hard to see how nations could exist at all.\n7. Nationalism can be \u201cactivated\u201d by different agents for different purposes (Brubaker)\nThe sociologist Rogers Brubaker argued in his 2006 work, Ethnicity Without Groups, that ethnic identities and nationalist fervor is not inherent to the groups themselves. Rather, in moments of conflicting interest, conflict, or any other shared political interest that may come up, much smaller interest groups begin to speak of ethnicities in distinct us-and-them terms, so as to engender and mobilize the strong forces of nationalism. As such, small political groups have time and again \u201cactivated\u201d wider sentiments of nationalism to launch aggression again perceived competitors of enemies.\nThis is made apparent by examples that Brubaker takes from e.g. the Yugoslavian war of the 1990s: people who had lived peacefully as neighbors or even friends could become deadly enemies the moment that nationality was weaponized. The weaponization of nationalism, however, did not at all have to coincide with actual interests of the ethnic group in its entirety \u2014 rather, it tended to coincide with the interests of much smaller groups that were of a political, not an ethnic, nature.\n8. National identity is more fluid than we normally think it is (Jenkins) and can be subjected to individual choice (Song)\nThe sociologist Richard Jenkins points out in his 1997 work, Rethinking Ethnicity, that relationships fall across a scale from the less formal ones (\u201cwe\u2019re buddies!\u201d) to the more formal ones (\u201cyou\u2019re a citizen of the USA!\u201d) and that ethnicity and nationality can slide across this scale. As such, people can creatively use different positions on this scale to further their own interests or try to gain recognition or otherwise improve their lives \u2014 often entailing rather elaborate balancing acts of being \u201cChinese American\u201d and so forth. However monolithic nationalism can appear from the outside, or at the macro scale, it tends to dissolve into a thousand unique realities whenever we zoom to the micro-sociological scale. The categorizations of nationalism are never straightforward \u2014 they always entail all sorts of negotiation, maneuvering, and sometimes deliberate manipulation to fit in. Likewise, people try to employ ethnic or racial markers to groups they seek to control or feel that they fear. Touchy questions: In today\u2019s Europe of Muslim, Arab, and criminal gang uprisings in banlieues \u2014 who is considered to be representative of these uprisings? It\u2019s a question that cuts to the heart of the French Presidential election.\nMiri Song, also a sociologist, expanded upon these questions in her 2003 work, Choosing Ethnic Identity. With ethnographic case studies, she showed that not only was national belonging always being renegotiated at the micro level; it was even the case that people make whole personal projects of creating themselves as a certain national and ethnic identity or mix of identities. Sometimes your skin color makes it harder for you to be the ethnic identity you wish, sometimes it makes it easier. Sometimes you get stuck between two identities, always categorized as \u201cthe other\u201d and so your alienation and resentment grows. \u201cThe people\u201d that is the object of a \u201cnational project\u201d always consists of conscious, alive, participants who seek to choose their own identities.\n9. Nationalism can draw upon several co-existing ethnic identities (Taylor)\nIt is true that nationalism has been defined as the convergence between an ethnic identity (Swedish) and a political unit (Kingdom of Sweden). But, in practice, there are always multiple ethnic identities present within a state\u2019s territory, and these can even be drawn upon as a part of the same nationalist project.\nUSA and Canada would be typical examples of such a nationalism, as these are originally not ethnic tribes, but charter-based projects for a variety of (mainly) settlers or colonizers. It is perhaps not then a coincidence that the great theorist of a multicultural state, the philosopher Charles Taylor, is Canadian. But for such multi-ethnic nations to function and not fall apart, they must develop ways to give recognition (nationalist pride, one way or another) to its different groups.\nThus, if nations struggle for recognition, so do ethnic groups within nations \u2014 but it is possible for nationalism to include the recognition of several ethnic identities, the struggles of which are thus conjoined.\n10. Nationalism is an ideology like liberalism and socialism, with a moderate and extremist (anti-democratic) wing (Lipset)\nFirst published in 1960, Political Man by sociologist Seymour Lipset explored the conditions for political democracy. Here, nationalism was considered to be an ideology that could take parliamentary or anti-parliamentary forms. In the latter case, it is extremist nationalism and overlaps with fascism or Nazism \u2014 thus being antithetical to political democracy.\nThis is, I suppose, an outdated and not very original view of the topic. I bring it up given the deep roots of nationalist extremism in today\u2019s Ukraine (which Putin\u2019s regime also used as a pretext for attacking the country). If Ukrainian nationalism is crucial for defending and rebuilding the country, and has the rest of the world awe-struck, it undeniably also has this ingredient. Sometimes, the word \u201cnationalism\u201d can simply be used to denote these violent, racist, chauvinist, and criminal elements of society. It\u2019s difficult to have good nationalism without at least an element of this \u2014 as the 2014 Maidan Square protests in Kyiv made apparent. The protests that ousted a pro-Russian illegitimate president also sported a presence of fascist marauders.\n11. Nationalism is an expression of \u201cidentitarian politics\u201d (Dahl) or \u201cidentity politics\u201d (Fukuyama)\nMy personal friend, the sociologist and expert on the far-right and the history of fascist and identitarian ideas, Goran Dahl, has described in older and recent books that nationalism is a commitment to a certain organic identity \u2014 not unlike entirely what I called the \u201cEthnos\u201d above. As such, it marries a commitment to the particular (not the universal) to a commitment to the collective (not the individual). Our collective particularity \u2014 when that is the main category of your politics, then you\u2019re a nationalist, to put it simply. Nationalism is often (but not always!) tied to a \u201cradical conservatism\u201d, to a \u201crevolution from the Right\u201d \u2014 and to ideas of reaffirming a lost sense of national pride, sometimes even with esoteric ideas of the reestablishment of a Golden Age (Compare to the party name of the Greek Nazis, Golden Dawn).This is described in his work, Radical Conservatism and the Future of Politics.\nGoran Dahl has very little in common with the political scientist, Francis Fukuyama, but indeed, in the latter\u2019s 2018 book Identity, Fukuyama also makes the case that cultural identity is becoming a stronger force in today\u2019s world, and hence culture wars and nationalism can be understood as a struggle for recognition of certain identities. As Fukuyama writes, nationalism (and Islamism) can be understood as a \u201cspecies of identity politics\u201d.\n(I have argued similarly in The Listening Society).\n12. Nationalism is the strongest social force when things hit the fan (Mearsheimer)\nJohn Mearsheimer (who just rose to internet fame through his NATO-critical commentary of the Ukrainian war, but was in fact already known as the world\u2019s no. 1 scholar of international relation of the \u201crealist\u201d school) means that, when it really comes down to it, we can rather safely make a few rather crude assumptions of how the world works:\nWhen it really comes down to it, nation states are made up of monopolies on violence, and thus they\u2019re more or less in charge of what happens.\nThe nation states don\u2019t control one another, and so they have to play against one another in a sort of international \u201canarchy\u201d where the strongest players will win and get their way, pretty much regardless of who the \u201cgood guy\u201d might be in that situation.\nAnd for that reason, when nations eventually come into conflict, national loyalty will very strongly tend to trump other loyalties (to ideas, to economic classes, to non-national identities).\nThis means that conflict and competition can activate nationalism, and that nationalism thus again and again reveals itself to be the strongest social force, even if it may be so dormant in periods that we almost forget about it.\nWe do ourselves a favor by not forgetting that: the struggle between nations, not ideologies or other things, is the strongest predictor of how nations act, and also the strongest force that drive people when things hits the fan.\nAs Mearsheimer has explained in seminars and interviews that comment upon the war in Ukraine, the reason it\u2019s so difficult to capture a country is precisely that: the invading force triggers the force of nationalism. The same happened, he maintains, in e.g. Afghanistan.\n13. Nationalism is a form of \u201cfalse consciousness\u201d (Miliband) and is generated by an \u201cideological state apparatus\u201d (Althusser)\nAlthough the \u201crealist\u201d Mearsheimer supported Bernie Sanders in the US elections, he is pretty much the direct opposite of Marxist thinkers in terms of the analysis of basic notions like nationalism.\nIf we look at the latter group, they all somehow echo Marx\u2019s view that national identity is a distraction from the \u201creal\u201d or \u201cmaterial\u201d identity of class. And, indeed, to the credit of Marxists, it was true that the Nazis directly sought to use national identity as a way of neutralizing all struggle between classes in Germany and instead direct the us-and-them logic towards other nations and \u201craces\u201d, while \u201cuniting all classes\u201d in a positively framed category of the Third Reich and its Volksgenossen.\nRalph Miliband, the political sociologist, wrote in his 1969 work The State in Capitalist Society that the state \u2014 including its ideology and identity \u2014 is ultimately a vehicle of the ruling class. Its oh-so-moving national narratives are little more than that: excuses for people to go along with the interests of the already powerful. Power legitimizes itself through \u201cpolitically socializing\u201d the population, and nationalism is a part of that. \u201cIdeology\u201d in this sense is not thought of as just any set of political ideas: it means a certain veil that masks and normalizes injustices in society.\nAnother Marxist, of the structuralist brand, Louis Althusser, held that there is an \u201cideological state apparatus\u201d that calls us forth as citizens and subjects of a state power \u2014 not least through education and the media. As such, each of us is structured as a \u201csubject\u201d, as someone who acts and thinks in a particular way that reproduces society. Nationalism is part of this \u2014 similarly to Milibands perspective. But with Althusser, ideology cannot as easily be seen through or transcended; rather, it must be reconstructed in a new (for Althusser, communist) manner.\nMarxist scholarship spoke relatively little of patriotism or positive nationalism, although it is fair to assume that for them, true patriotism should be towards universalist, socialist or communist, projects. Note for instance that the Soviet Union is more or less the only country that has had no geographical or ethnic denotation in its name.\nWith this perspective, you could still view the Ukrainian resistance against Russian aggression as a form of benevolent patriotism \u2014 but you\u2019re suspicious of the tendency to emphasize national belonging over class and material interests, of its power to justify new inequalities as soon as the war is over.\n14. Nationalism arose in the age of globalization \u2014 and since decolonization from the 1950s and onwards, new contenders have risen to challenge the power balance\nWhat we classically associate with \u201cnationalism\u201d brings forth mental images of France, Germany, and the like: European countries becoming nation states. In today\u2019s world however, the most impactful nationalist projects are not the \u201cnationalist\u201d parties in these countries, but rather the nationalisms of former second and third world countries.\nAs such, nationalism plays a key role in the \u201crise of the Global South\u201d. Robert B. Marks notes in the 2007 book, The Origins of the Modern World, that the association between \u201cmodern\u201d society and the West is a pretty short parenthesis in world history. It\u2019s thus, we might reason, likely to balance out as modern society spreads and takes root across the world. A very similar line of argument is detailed in the particular comparison between the industrialization of Europe and China in Kenneth Pomeranz\u2019s The Great Divergence. Should we be so surprised by the ferocity of Chinese nationalism when this chasm is closed? Likewise, Janet L. Abu-Lugod details the time Before European Hegemony in her work with that title, and by that she refers to the late middle ages. The greatest nationalist movements of today all seek to challenge this hegemony, this dominance of the West\u2014and that\u2019s not always a good thing, as such vengeful nationalism is often a violent and anti-democratic one.\nFinally, one could mention the work of economic development and poverty scholars like John Ibister, who in Promises Not Kept details the many betrayals of the rich world vis-\u00e0-vis poor countries. Naturally, such narratives of economic subjugation and disrespect tend to fuel nationalist movements that resist the Global North and seek to establish Global South sovereignty, solidarity, and pride.\nNaturally, Russia very deliberately caters to this aspect of nationalism in today\u2019s world when its government maintains that they\u2019re invading Ukraine in \u201cthe fight for a multipolar world\u201d. Many people around the world cannot help but be enthused: Shall this spell the end of Western hegemony, of hurt pride, of promises not kept?\n15. Nationalism is a search for roots, for emotional grounding, in the fragmented condition of postmodernity (Friedman)\nJonathan Friedman, the anthropologist, is also a bit of a friend of my own. His way of understanding nationalism is a multifaceted one that I shall have to simplify for the sake of argument.\nIn his 1994 work, Cultural Identity and Global Process, Friedman touches upon nationalism many times. He means that globalization uproots and confuses our identities. People thus respond by looking to spark or revive nationalist identities \u2014 it\u2019s not only postcolonial nationalism that is rising, so is Flemish, Basque, Scottish, and so on. As such, nationalism far from always integrates societies; separatist nationalists also destabilize and disintegrate them. This form of nationalism increases with globalization, and while it is to a significant extent caused by globalization, it is also inherent to the resistance towards (and the backlash against) it that we know today.\n16. Nationalism can be a form of resistance against globalization \u201cfrom below\u201d, revitalizing local and national histories (Overgaard, Andersen)\nMorten Overgaard, also a friend not-of-the-same-political-views-as-myself, has envisioned a new role for nationalism in the established of future societies and economies (which he, using a the same term as I do, calls \u201cmetamodern\u201d, although attaching a different meaning to the term).\nFor Overgaard, nationalism can be used to create the organic bonds that should be activated for \u201cnational collective intelligence\u201d \u2014 hence detaching more and more of the economy from the processes of globalization and establishing a more commons-based economy, where the solidarity required for the commons to function builds on nationalist, cultural cohesion. This is discussed in his book, National Collective Intelligence. In my mind, there are too many possible slides into far-right aberrations for this to be a viable path.\nAnother Danish acquaintance, Lene Andersen, is less attracted perhaps to nationalism as such, but nevertheless argues for the establishment of stronger local, national, or regional (e.g. pan-Scandinavian) identities as vehicles for greater Bildung (German term, roughly meaning education in a holistic sense). She also associates this with \u201cmetamodern\u201d future societies (as with Overgaard, though, in a manner that differs from my own). This is, I would say, a learned form of nationalism concerned with the interface between tradition and the psychological development of a population. Andersen lays this out in her book, The Nordic Secret.\nWartime economies like Ukraine\u2019s actually don\u2019t fall so far away from the visions of Overgaard and Andersen: people are cooperating and exchanging in distinctly non-capitalist manners based on national identity (Overgaard) and are actively seeking to protect their cultural heritage from destruction and viewing this as a test of personal character (Andersen).\n17. Nationalism expresses a deeper underlying \u201cclash of civilizations\u201d (Huntington)\nAn argument that is very well-known but cannot be missed if this list is to be exhaustive is that of political scientist Samuel Huntington. In his classical The Clash of Civilizations, Huntington holds that it\u2019s not nations that will be the center as our world progresses into a new age: it\u2019s larger communities of nations, bound together by deep, underlying, civilizational patterns and heritages.\nThe clash of civilizations according to Huntington (1996) The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order. From Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clash_of_Civilizations#/media/File:Clash_of_Civilizations_mapn2.png.\nAlthough the war in Ukraine can certainly be perceived as Ukraine fundamentally being torn between two such civilizational spheres, there are, however, also many counter-examples to Huntington\u2019s predictions: Orthodox countries like Bulgaria, Greece and Romania closely aligning themselves with the West, not fellow Orthodox Russia; Confucian countries like South Korea and Taiwan, together with the insular civilization of Japan, also aligning with the West against China and Russia; Islamic countries more (or at least equally) interested in clashing with fellow Muslim countries as with other civilizations; and so on. In the case of Ukraine today, the \u201ccleft country\u201d aspect seems to have more or less vanished through the war with Russia, uniting the entire country, Western Ukrainian-speakers as well as Eastern Russian-speakers, against the Kremlin-controlled invaders.\nThat Ukraine and most of Orthodox Eastern Europe seems to have \u201cdefected\u201d to the West, does not, however, take anything away from the fact that most Russians generally tend to identify with being a distinct Orthodox civilization that is different and in opposition to the West. The same can be said about the nature of Chinese nationalism, or Indian for that matter, not to mention the role of Islam in shaping identities in the Middle East.\nIn Huntington\u2019s view, then, nationalism is a strong force, but it has deeper, pan-civilizational undercurrents that should not be underestimated.\n18. Nationalism is also resisted by \u201ctransnationalism from below\u201d\nIn Transnationalism from Below (1998), an anthology by Michael P. Smith and Luis E. Guarnizo showed with plenty of examples that our common sense notion that \u201cnationalism happens from below\u201d and \u201ctransnationalism happens from above\u201d is often a mistaken one. It just as often happens, mostly in the third world, that nationalist projects of nation states are faced by resistance from below, which swear by transnational solidarities and identities.\nPoor peasants resisting the corporate influence on governments in Latin America, Mexican migrants resisting national borders, Hong Kong\u2019s resistance against China\u2019s nationalism \u2014 these are transnational by nature, working against nationalist projects, but without having any \u201cglobal state\u201d or the like in mind. This is a popular trope to study for social scientists, so further anthologies provide a flood of book chapters. Roxann Prazniak and Arif Dirlik have edited another one, titled Places and Politics in an Age of Globalization. In its ninth chapter, for instance, anthropologist Arturo Escobar (also an acquaintance) details how the mainstream versions of \u201ceconomic development\u201d are challenged from below, by those who should purportedly be developed by someone else.\nMichael Hardt and Antonio Negri\u2019s work, Assemblage, could be said to follow a similar pattern: movements of resistance and solidarity exist around the world \u2014 feminist, queer, indigenous, minority, worker, environmentalist,, precariat, and so forth \u2014 and these all need to challenge national vestiges of power. Hence, they tend to ally and link up transnationally, however provisional and practically limited such \u201cassemblages\u201d of movements may be. This is also, thus, a transnationalism from below.\nIn the context of the Ukrainian war, you might notice how the LGBTQ+ communities scramble to show solidarity with Ukrainian peers. This is not a nationalist move \u2014 it is a transnational solidarity that resists the logic of nationalism.\n19. Nationalism can be reconstructed as planetary belonging\nMy friend Jeremy Johnson has argued in his chapter in the 2021 volume, Metamodernity, that it makes more sense to speak of the \u201cplanetary\u201d than the \u201cglobal\u201d, because the former seems to encompass a wider view. It\u2019s not just that people interact \u201cacross the globe\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s that we\u2019re all part of one and the same planet, with a shared history that dives into the biological and geological processes we live by.\nThis theme can be reflected in other thinkers. In Paul Raskin\u2019s (founder of the Tellus Institute) book, Journey to Earthland, the argument is made that, if national identity could be formed around abstract countries, it should also be possible to create a \u201ccountry\u201d that spans across the earth in its entirety, as a planetary system. For Raskin\u2019s imagined country, \u201cEarthland\u201d, globalism is the new nationalism. It commits to shared values and common interests, but otherwise leaves more room for unique cultural expressions than nationalism did.\nRaskin does not truly respond to the theorists who emphasize the necessity of us-and-thems for national identity to even exist (who is the \u201cother\u201d of Earthland? Mars?)\u2014but read together with Johnson\u2019s shift from \u201cglobal to planetary\u201d, he at least makes an interesting claim: that people could become as enamored with the emerging planetary identity as they have been with their nations. He points out that nationalism also arose from smaller social units and tribes.\nFrom this perspective, the Ukrainian war could be viewed not as much as a struggle between nation states, but rather as one between nationalist movements and early forms of planetary ones: \u201cEarthland\u201d is emerging through the transnational support of Ukraine. Perhaps nationalism for Earthland could, after all, become a power to reckon with?\n20. Nationalism can be reconstructed as bioregionalism\nFinally. While globalist cosmopolitans dream of Earthland, deep ecologists dream of a return to the earth in another manner: that the future of political organization should be based on the ecosystems that people are part of, that they live in.\nThis position is called bioregionalism because it means that your home would be defined not by nations as we have known them, but by the bioregions we inhabit. For such deep ecologists, it makes more sense to define and protect the borders of the specific part of nature you live on together with other people. If nations were to be redefined as bioregions, the entire identity, institutions, and customs could be harmonized with the environment.\nThe future of national identity would thus be to morph into bioregionalism. Although there is undeniably an increasing interest in reconnecting with the environment around the world, to me the bioregionalists fail to understand just how strong the current form of nationalism is. Thus far, very few people die for their bioregions (indigenous activists in the Amazon, etc., would be the counter example).\nBut maybe there is more to it: If there is a positive future for nationalism, perhaps it could at least draw upon bioregionalist influences? Looking at the Ukrainian war again, it holds true that environmental aspects of geopolitics and nationalist struggle were activated around Chernobyl. Ukrainians needed to identify with the soil itself, as the presence of the invader became an environmental security threat.\nMulti-Perspectivalism or Astrology?\nI have long maintained that \u201cwhoever has the most perspectives when they die, wins\u201d. I hope I have hereby contributed to a victorious death on your behalf.\nBut there is, undeniably, a disconcerting part of this exercise:\nIt is that pretty much all of the 20 perspectives can, with a bit of imagination and finding the facts that happen to suit their different claims, seem to describe and at least in part explain e.g. the conflict in Ukraine. At the same time, many of the perspectives seem to contradict one another. It sounds eerily like astrology: Read the Gemini, and you\u2019re it! Read the Libra, you\u2019re probably also it!\nIf seemingly contradictory theories can be confirmed with the same cases, is this not just a sign of the hopelessness of any social science? Should we give up \u2014 it\u2019s little better than astrology, after all? The \u201cclarity of mind\u201d we gain from adopting one perspective over the other may be entirety illusory. We\u2019re seeing patterns in the world because we\u2019re teaching ourselves to look for those very patterns.\nHere\u2019s what I hold. Simply cataloguing perspectives and applying them is not enough to make us much wiser. It\u2019s the first step, yes. These 20 perspectives are building blocks for your reasoning. They\u2019re there to jog your mind, to help you get out of preconceived notions. It\u2019s easy to see that anyone who doesn\u2019t know of one of these perspectives is less smart for it.\nBut the next step is to coordinate the different perspectives \u2014 to offer a synthesis, a path forward for nationalism that is congruent with metamodernist values and Protopian goals. This shall be the topic of my next piece.\nHanzi Freinacht is a political philosopher, historian, and sociologist, author of \u2018The Listening Society\u2019, \u2018Nordic Ideology\u2019 and the upcoming books \u2018The 6 Hidden Patterns of History\u2019 and \u2018Outcompeting Capitalism\u2019.

Prices skyrocket. \u201cBored apes\u201d join the fray and Madonna got one. Many more projects struggle to become part of the action. A whole market mushrooms with at least a dozen marketplaces like Rarible, OpenSea, Larva Labs (where you can now get your very own cryptopunk for as little as 200.000 USD, but don\u2019t ask about the expensive ones) and so on. In the background lurk major anonymous collectors like the legendary WhaleShark who reportedly owns 400k NTFs (enigmatically self-describing as a \u201csocial entrepreneur and investor with a focus on disrupting the status quo, while elevating the brave and dedicated communities behind the innovation\u201d).\nOf course, scams have proliferated in no-time. As wasps to non-zero Pepsi, grifters have amassed and scrambled to profit. This article lists ten types of scams that have already been identified and victimized many. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s more of where that came from.\nCryptopunks.\nNFTs = The \u201cContemporary Art\u201d Market Crossed with Cryptocurrency\nI will refrain from a closer discussion of the technicalities of NFTs as many others have already done good jobs at explaining the phenomenon and it\u2019s already being discussed by more people than I could overview. Basically, you become the owner of NFTs on a blockchain that guarantees that the image is owned by you, even if it\u2019s a digital image that of course anyone else can still download and use. While anyone can have a printed postcard of the Mona Lisa, there is only one \u201creal\u201d Mona Lisa in the Louvre. The blockchain code is the digital counterpart of your owning this \u201creal\u201d Mona Lisa.\nWhat I wish to draw attention to are instead the sociological traps and potentials of the rise of this phenomenon. Particularly, I am committed to the generation of new societal forms that can be called \u201cProtopian\u201d (i.e. societies that can flourish on the other side of modern life), and I\u2019d like to lay out how the NFT phenomenon \u2014 for all its obvious wackiness and distortions of incentives and income distribution \u2014 can come to play a key role in the creation of social experiments with new and better adapted ways of organizing societies around the world.\nThe NFT phenomenon may be a hype with huge distractions of speculation and a long shadow of criminality. But its sheer force is undeniable: anything that can move countless millions of dollars across the world can only be viewed as an economic energy to be reckoned with. And such a strong force can and will, arguably, also be harnessed for socially sane purposes, along with the insane ones.\nThe NFT revolution combines two principles:\nThe creation of cryptocurrencies on a blockchain.\nThe speculation in contemporary art and art collections.\nIn brief, each NFT artwork is a unique \u201ccoin\u201d or bill with a value seemingly arbitrarily attached to it. It\u2019s just that the coin is the artwork in an of itself, or rather, the coin is the code that says you own the \u201coriginal\u201d. Like with money, if enough people \u201cbelieve\u201d in that value, it\u2019s there. Poof. A lot of rabbits are being pulled out of a lot of hats. Some of the hatters go crazy, some become filthy rich. Both things have been known to coincide.\nTo better understand how the rise of the NFTs is part of a new social and economic logic, where cultural capital rules and drives financial capital (previously discussed by me here and here), we need to investigate the nature of how the arts (and their markets) have developed over the last decades.\nThe Social Construction of Reality Becomes Transparent\nThis discussion, in turn, shall lead us to an understanding of a more generally pervading principle of sociology: the social construction of reality or social constructionism. Simply put, we have gone from a (Modern) situation in which social construction was mostly unconscious and implicit, to one where it has become understood to a point where it can be hacked (Postmodernity), and we are now entering a cultural situation where it is becoming obvious and apparent, out in the open in all of its absurdity, and can thus be actively harnessed for purposes good and evil (Metamodernity). The genie of social construction is, as it were, out of the bottle for all to see \u2014 and for many more of us to use.\nA new social game emerges: whoever can make others believe in the value of their tokens, wins. It\u2019s the game of social magic. The game of wizards of social construction. And to increase the value of your tokens, you have to get people to believe that others will believe in it, too, so that their investments will pay off in terms of spiking valuations. The mastery over social construction has risen to the top of the savviest minds \u2014 in tech, in finance, in arts, and soon across the field.\nThe NFTs lie at the very crux of this story \u2014 they started out, unsurprisingly, as a mechanism for a few people to get unreasonably rich unreasonably fast, quickly slid to ignoble uses, and are now beginning to increasingly become a genuine transformational potential for the common good.\nMy claim is that NFTs can play a key role in releasing our joint imaginative efforts to redefine social realities. This happens first, perhaps, within virtual worlds and the Metaverse (the emerging, immersive version of the Internet). But, as what Baudrillard called hyperreality increasingly drives and reorganizes the experience of and relationships pertain to everyday life, life and society as we know them can also transform as a result.\nInventive and idealistic employment of NFT technologies and investments can thus drive projects that redefine human relationships and create opportunities for what I call a Metamodern society.\nBut I\u2019m getting ahead of myself. How does this startling phenomenon relate to a wider sociological shift of our shared consciousness?\nPostmodernism \u2014 and the Magic of Fake It \u2019til You Make It\nTo fully make the argument here, to see how and why the NFT market could evolve, we need to take a detour into the world of postmodern art.\nIn sociology, the term \u201cpassing\u201d refers to a person\u2019s ability to blend into a certain social context. For instance, I have crashed more than one academic conference since I simply \u201cpass\u201d as an academic, even enjoying a few nice buffet leftovers in the process. If I were a rugged, street-roaming mendicant, I wouldn\u2019t have made it past the door to the seminars and keynotes. I have academic \u201cpassing\u201d. I probably couldn\u2019t have crashed a party held by biker thugs. You can pass as middle class, straight, or anything else. Passing is often a certain privilege \u2014 and it allows entry and access to certain networks. It\u2019s one of the key mechanisms of how class society reproduces itself.\nLearning a few manners and mannerisms to \u201cpass\u201d can go a long way. More than one inventive grifter have discovered as much: You can become \u201cpassing\u201d as parts of the superrich elites. Recently, the world has watched in morbid fascination, on Netflix and other media, the workings of the Tinder Swindler (a common criminal who designed an elaborate scheme to live a superrich life, impressing the next woman with the wealth he scammed off of the last lady, in what amounted to a huge and uniquely pernicious pyramid scheme), Anna Sorokin (who impersonated a wealthy German heiress just to impress the upper echelons of New York society, of course mixing in a lot of contemporary art into the scheme), the Danish Stein Bagger (who simply conned his way to millions by making it appear as though he had a big company and getting plenty of loans), and, of course, the cult-like and worldwide scam that was the WeWork open office complex (which was made possible by an especially energetic and charismatic company founder who left so many lives in shambles). Fake it until you make it, right?\nThe Tinder Swindler \u2014 \u201cpassing\u201d as a rich gentleman.\nIn their very own way, the financial system and stock markets have followed a similar logic, where social reality has been hacked \u2014 with very real consequences. The GameStop debacle that shook Wall Street in early 2021 (where Reddit users caught major investors in a \u201cbig short\u201d and pumped the value of the stock to unearthly heights) is just one example. Another is the housing mortgage bubble of 2008 \u2014 it heralded a new age of wild speculation, a virtual reality detached from the material economy, following its own logic but ultimately affecting economic realities. Fortunes made, fortunes lost, livelihoods destabilized. Virtual actions with very real consequences.\nUnsurprisingly, the art world \u2014 which tends to portend social logics in so many ways \u2014 saw its own corresponding scandals play out already in earlier decades. And this, too, was honored with its own Netflix documentary. In Made You Look: A True Story about Fake Art, the story of a major scam is detailed. A large number of fake paintings were sold by New York\u2019s most respectable art dealer, Knoedler (founded back in 1846!), and ended up not only in the private collections of the superrich, but in renowned galleries like the Metropolitan.\nThese weren\u2019t exactly \u201ccopies\u201d of art; just paintings made in the styles of major American 1950s artists like Jackson Pollock, Andy Warhol, and Mark Rothko by a Chinese math professor in his garage in Queens. Then a few grifters went ahead and made up stories about the provenance of the paintings (they had been bought by an anonymous family back in the 1950s and had now been rediscovered, etc.). Beginning in 1995, the scams went on for well over a decade and involved over 80m USD \u2014 until eventually forensic analysis revealed that there was paint used only invented in the 1970s, the observation was made that there was no evidence of the paintings existing in old photographs with the painters, and so on. Knoedler, the \u201cfinest\u201d art dealer in America, came down as a house of cards.\nKnoedler Gallery in New York, before it closed in 2011.\nInteresting as this documentary is, it seems to miss what in my mind is the main point of how the art market developed: that postmodern art itself had exhausted itself as a movement and begun to run amok as a Warholesque replica of its original impulse. The postmodern creative spark was no longer the crux of art itself, nor of the inventive genius and prescience of the artists, but the very field had been colonized by rich art collectors who wished to exchange financial capital for prestige and cultural capital, by the art dealers who pandered to this impulse through exclusive auctions, by designated experts who propped up the value of the art with so much sophisticated \u201canalysis\u201d, and \u2014 eventually \u2014 by downright con artists who managed to \u201cpass\u201d as any of the above. And, it should be said, by a growing cadre of fairly manipulative artists who exchanged artistic genius for the genius of magicians: to create scenes in which their artwork was valued and esteemed by the people who were, in turn, valued and esteemed in society at large.\nWhat we normally refer to as \u201cmodern\u201d art (pertaining to the \u201cmodernist\u201d period) is a wide umbrella of art movements that, in painting, were prevalent roughly from the 1920s and onwards \u2014 but it may just as well be called \u201cpostmodern\u201d art. If you look at the Wiki articles for Modernism and Postmodern art, many of the examples discussed overlap. This is because the social logic embodied within the arts always develops somewhat ahead of culture and society at large \u2014 so at high modernity, from the 1920s and onwards, you already see postmodern logic playing out in the realm of the arts.\nThis logic took a firm and undeniable hold of the art world when Marcel Duchamp put a porcelain urinal on display in a museum in 1917 and called it The Fountain. In one stroke, he revealed the social construction of the very category we designate as \u201cart\u201d: art was art because it was being branded as such when displayed and revered in a museum. It caused a splash (no pun intended) and a scandal \u2014 which made the piece of art famous, and thus incredibly valuable. The postmodern tendencies of irreverence, ironic distancing, deconstructing social realities, critique, open questions, and social construction are all but painfully apparent in retrospect \u2014 even if the commentators of the time didn\u2019t use the term postmodern (although, emblematically, the term was first used in a book published by a German philosopher the very same year).\nThe Fountain by Marcel Duchamp, 1917.\nIt was this tendency of irreverence towards the categories of modern society (art, religion, economy, and so forth) that in turn underlined much of the creative explosion in the decades that followed: we saw the rise of Picasso, Dal\u00ed, and all the rest of the geniuses that found ways of breaking away from modernity and its three-dimensional Newtonian space (which, in turn, goes back to the Italian Renaissance).\nIn the 1950s, especially in New York which was a sort of cultural center of the world after the Second World War, this movement culminated with the likes of Jackson Pollock (the wild expressionist who sought to express raw, internal states on the canvas with no inhibition or filter of interpretation or translation) and, of course, Andy Warhol.\nConvergence, 1952, by Jackson Pollock (from jacksonpollock.org)\nAt this point in time, the 1950s, there was arguably still a generative explosion of innovation in postmodern art. Pollock was not \u201cjust splashing paint like a kid\u201d and adding a few nails for good measure. A host of research has revealed fractals in his paintings, an increasing complexity of these fractals as his career progresses, and even an increasing appeal of the more complex fractals to viewers in controlled experimental settings. There\u2019s more to it than splashing colors and furiously adding nails.\nBut, most of all, it was Warhol who epitomized the consummation of postmodern logic in the arts: his work melded with his public persona and it showed a collapse between the popular and \u201cfine\u201d art, a ruthless reflection of the endless simulacras of modern copy-paste society, lifestyles of norm-breaking with a shrug at his famous New York venue The Factory, and his own replies in interviews always being deliberately devoid of meaning: \u201cI don\u2019t know what the art is about, you tell me\u201d and so forth. Warhol was the pure embodiment of postmodern cultural logic in the art world, a kind of Foucault of the arts (as in the archetypal postmodern scholar/philosopher a few decades later, Michel Foucault). While the two are almost diametrically opposite in terms of demeanor and temperament (one mellow and shy, the other veritably sparkling with opinionated intensity), their biographies do indeed show more parallels than could be ignored. Warhol did not just comment upon the flatness of meaning in art, he lived it to the fullest, ironically thereby achieving an artist\u2019s life like no other. It\u2019s hard not to admire him: when asked, he plainly told everyone exactly what he was doing \u2014 he was just never believed or taken literally, which was largely the source of his success.\nThe creative venue of innovation opened up by Duchamp was in effect exhausted by Warhol (who, surprise-surprise, counted Duchamp among his greatest influences). \u201cPost Warhol\u201d, what was there really for postmodern art to do? What was left to reveal? The category of fine art had already been broken out of, by its own master, its own Houdini.\nIn many ways, the historical moment of postmodern art was over before the 1960s had passed. But, of course, that\u2019s only true in terms of its ingenuity, originality, and deep relevance to culture. For most of us, it had just started! And so, millions of artists, dealers, collectors, and curators sought to join a party that was already over. A lot of money became involved. Bubbles started being blown up. Municipalities started paying huge sums for modernist sculptures and painting to fill up public spaces and institutions. The age of \u201cincomprehensibly sophisticated culture\u201d was here \u2014 always promising wealth and prestige to the acolytes refined enough to appreciate it.\nMeanwhile, \u201cthe world spirit\u201d (to vulgarly misuse Hegel\u2019s term) had moved on to new horizons. What was left was a game of trying to become part of this action, of this moment of cultural breakthrough \u2014 as though it could be frozen in time, and, like a Warhol triptych, repeat itself in ever new shrill colors.\nNow, in light of this analysis, I urge the reader to consider this fake Rothko painting that the Chinese math professor had made (drawing on the centuries-old East Asian tradition in art and crafts, to studiously copy works of art):\nPei-Shen Qian painting in the style of Mark Rothko, one of the Abstract Expressionist fakes sold by the Knoedler Gallery. Luke Nikas/the Winterthur Museum.\nIt\u2019s a good \u201cRothko\u201d \u2014 well made. But what of the painting itself, viewed apart from all connotations of \u201cfine art\u201d?\nWell. What can we say, in all honesty? It\u2019s two squares. It looks like someone\u2019s been sampling two paints on a yellow background. If it\u2019s sublimely beautiful, you tell me how and why.\nNevertheless, please do note that leading art dealers, a number of accredited experts, and buyers, and exhibition curators, all agreed that this was a sublime piece of rediscovered art. Note, moreover, that people reportedly fell deeply in love with this painting and exchanged millions of dollars for it. If there ever was a naked emperor, this is it: it came in the form of two squares on a yellow background \u2014 not even as a porcelain urinal. This was a situation in which scams were just waiting to happen, given that there was already such a degree of apparent bogus to the whole endeavor.\nA part of us might be thinking that these superrich pretentious snobs had it coming. But there is more to it. They were part of a social logic playing out at the heart of Western (and even global) culture.\nThe very fact that the legendary Rothko could so easily be forged \u2014 in fact, that this was the attractor point awaiting the entirety of the postmodern art world \u2014 should be obvious: It\u2019s not really a very interesting painting in and of itself. Rothko just made squares, lots of squares. The real action was made up by the social processes that placed his squares in sacred spaces called museums and galleries, and then a postmodern priesthood of art scholars sprinkled their fairy dust on it. It was made to \u201cpass\u201d as art, because it was good at slapping the art world\u2019s pretentions in their face. And then replicas of this irreverence were bound to show up. Capitalism, I guess, always wins. It gobbled up Rothko just as easily as the symbol of Che Guevara. If postmodernism sought to escape from the confines of modern disenchantment and hypocrisy, to at least be honest and authentic about just how artificial and synthetic our world is, late modernity responded by being massively inauthentic about authenticity. Checkmate.\nPostmodernism flattened the view of art, revealing that its mystery is to be found outside of the artwork itself \u2014 in its contexts, in the participant eye of the beholder, even in the angle of observation. But the God of Cruel Jokes caught on, and turned this on its head: \u201cOkay, so if the sacred can be constructed by manipulating context, I shall manipulate the context of postmodern art and sensibility to create meaningless money machines.\u201d\nAfter Warhol the artist, whose work is fundamentally emancipatory, came the Warholeque monster that we today know as contemporary art: a vast factory (sic!) of empty simulacras of feigned authenticity and phony critique. And cash.\nLike all other social logics, postmodernism imploded: it collapsed under the weight of its own premises. As art, certainly \u2014 and as philosophy, increasingly so. When it collapses, it exacerbates the logic that came before it: that of mainstream, modern, consumer capitalism.\nHow NFTs Bring Social Construction to Its Conclusion\nNow, only a few years after the humiliating own-goals of the art world, the NFTs emerged. The money involved is magnitudes larger and the whole thing seemed to emerge out of nowhere.\nIf we compare the way in which \u201cvalue\u201d is created and ascribed to a Rothko, to say, a cryptopunk, the two are similar. But a cryptopunk can, without even having material existence, be much more valuable. It doesn\u2019t claim originality, nor a noble pedigree of provenance (\u201cthis was owned first by the Queen of England and kept in Buckingham Palace, then by Paul McCartney, then by Xi Jinping, and now it is yours!\u201d). It doesn\u2019t claim genius. It is not part of profound commentary of our world. It has no sacred aura. It\u2019s just valuable because people speculate that it will become more valuable, because more people are believed to speculate in the future.\nDoes that mean that the cryptopunks are nothing more than a bubble, like the tulips of 1637, these fleurs du mal? No. For certain, the NFT market as a whole will see bubbles, rises and falls, and whole sections going defunct after some craze or pyramid scheme. But the cryptopunks \u2014 and the Bored Apes, peace be with them \u2014 will remain valuable simply because they have passed a threshold of enough of speculators. Their prices will vary, and they are far from \u201csound investments\u201d, but, like a Rothko, they have become valuable because they are so damned famous (at least, collectively speaking), and they are so famous because they are valuable. So at least these will continue to hold value \u2014 or that\u2019s my bet, but please don\u2019t take financial advice from a social theorist.\nBut the most valuable NFTs are more like the fake Rothko than the \u201creal\u201d ones. The fake Rothko is recent. It\u2019s made for money. It\u2019s made for speculation. It\u2019s made to be a money reserve, where investments build on rising expectations of rising expectations.\nThe difference between the fake Rothko and the cryptopunk is that the latter is honest about its dishonesty and absurdity. It just builds on the craze and momentum of cryptocurrencies and found a niche in this market: If people are already investing in \u201cjust a piece of blockchain\u201d \u2014 why not mint unique pieces of \u201cjust a piece of blockchain\u201d? It just happened to find a way to \u201cpass\u201d as a currency, and thus as a way to \u201cpass\u201d as an art investment.\nIt\u2019s actually a lot like what Warhol himself did with the art world. He was entirely honest about the meaninglessness of what he was doing, thereby ironically enchanting his work and persona with an especially mystical lure. He appeared to be able to break the rules of social reality, which made him and his work sacred, larger than life. There\u2019s a whole literature on these things in the sociology of religion. Warhol (and those like him in those select moments of history) seem to \u201cwalk on (sociological) water\u201d. From thereon, everything they touch becomes gold.\nNow, the originator/s of the cryptopunks have done something similar: they have created a phenomenon that seems to defy all social reason. The sheer banality of the cryptopunks (I could probably have made them in Paint when I was about 14\u201315) spits in the face of art being art, and it spits in the face of cryptocurrencies being practical means of exchange.\nIt\u2019s a speculation that knows it\u2019s a speculation. A construction of unreasonable fortunes of wealth that we know are absurd \u2014 and somehow damned funny. Like the GameStop stock explosion, it\u2019s the revenge of pajama-clad basement hackers against the world of fine arts.\nAnd that defiance of all reason drives the damned things to yet higher soaring valuations! It\u2019s irony and sarcasm taking over the world, and now dictating where millions and millions of dollars do and accumulate.\nGoing from Bad to Good: Speculation for Cultural Capital\nNow, in a world where the unequal distribution of wealth and the skewing of incentives away from honest work are major problems, there can be no doubt whether the NFTs are mostly good or bad. They are beautiful flowers, in a way, at least given the sheer audacity and weirdness of the social logic that brought them to life \u2014 but if so, they are still flowers of evil, fleurs du mal.\nBut just as all good things are also bad, so all bad things are also good. And especially powerfully bad things can lead to especially powerful good things.\nThe NFTs have opened up a certain Pandora\u2019s Box of \u201cspeculation in just about anything\u201d. Here\u2019s my main argument:\nBecause the NFTs have made it apparent that you can create avalanches of speculative value worth millions and millions based on the most banal and stupid little things, they have also opened up the space of shared imagination for speculation in investments into increasingly meaningful things.\nThe very fact that real, hard money is being spent on NFTs is exactly what unlocks their potential for becoming generators of new social realities: this sort of money makes something that was \u201cunreal\u201d yesterday suddenly become \u201creal\u201d today.\nAnd meaningful things are those that have cultural uniqueness and value to people. Meaning, the management of complexity in society, and transformations are the main scarcities of our day and age. Up until now, you couldn\u2019t buy a piece of it with your money. Now, as the world scrambles to create the \u201cbest NFTs\u201d, the best ones will \u2014 and this is my little ironic prophecy \u2014 eventually turn out to be the most meaningful ones.\nFirst, I suppose, this will entail more and more enticing and interesting artwork.\nSecondly, from there on, NFTs will be minted that take stakes in the development of entire bodies of philosophy and literature, where sentences and statements are bought and sold, while funding further creative thinking.\nThirdly, solutions to social problems and postcapitalist cooperatives that resolve (like, e.g. Cooperation Jackson) will be able to be speculated in \u2014 not because you \u201cwant to help them\u201d, but because you understand that others also want to own a piece of this unique piece of social experiment \u201cbefore it became cool\u201d.\nFourth, you might even see speculations in the creations of entire societies \u2014 initially, of course, the unhoused younger generations may be buying virtual real estate in cyberspace and stimulating the creation of all sorts of online worlds (gaming-gone-wild), but eventually, stakes can be bought in experimental societies themselves, in Protopian projects. Imagine you own a piece of the future form of nation-state that effectively resolves issues of work and distribution, versus if you own a cryptopunk \u2014 which one do you think will be most cherished in the end?\nWe can collectively begin to speculate in cultural capital, in sociological imagination, in the artworks of life itself. It will take many more imaginative leaps to get there, but there is good reason to believe that such an attractor point could be on the horizon: in a world where meaninglessness is exposed in all of its vulgarity, the genuinely meaningful would likely become highly valued \u2014 indeed, valued enough to explode in crazy evaluations that defy all social logic. And so idealistic recreators of society could begin to manage billions through collective and democratic forms of governance.\nIn terms of development from modern life, to postmoderity, and onwards to what I call \u201cmetamodernity\u201d the most fundamental principle is this one:\nModernity divides social reality into clearly distinguished spheres, like art, religion, market, politics, science, the civil sphere, and private life.\nPostmodernism challenges and breaks out of the confines of these categories, escapes the implicit definitions of \u201cwhat art can be\u201d.\nMetamodernity begins to come online when art has escaped from its modern confines and now, as a genie out of the bottle, begins to recreate all of society in its radical experimentation and creativity.\nLet\u2019s be honest, it\u2019s an equally wondrous and terrifying prospect.\nFuture: Metamodern Intellectual Property\nThe above discussion promptly leads to another one: If the multitude of \u201cpro-social\u201d and transformative movements and creatives are to wrest control over the speculative madness of our age, we would need new forms of intellectual property to manage such projects.\nFor NFTs to begin to play socially creative and positive roles in the search of Protopian solutions to the troubles of modern society, we must also reimagine the intellectual ownership structures themselves \u2014 not least as much of the symbols that could be issued as NFTs would necessarily be intellectual innovations and memes.\nIn her book chapter of the 2021 volume Metamodernity (in which I also have a chapter), Siva Thambisetty argues that there is something rotten in the kingdom of intellectual property (IP). While the purpose of IP has been to spur innovation and protect innovators, it has also created artificial scarcity, skewed incentives, shifted games from innovation to legal battles, excluded the needing, and radically centralized economic power to few hands. Likewise, my friend Rufus Pollock has written a book titled The Open Revolution that argues for rewarding innovators through a system that still guarantees open access to the innovations themselves (not entirely unlike how Spotify or national license services function for music).\nIf there are speculative bubbles of \u201cart investments\u201d (where art itself, then, increasingly spills over into other realms and begin to redefine them) in increasingly socially and culturally meaningful endeavors, there should reasonably be regulations that guarantee the accountability of the projects as well as making certain that a part of the speculative drive actually benefits the project itself.\nThis would be an entirely new form of market \u2014 a synthesis of intellectual property, philanthropy, the financial market (including stock markets), and, of course, blockchain and the art market.\nAt this point, the jury\u2019s still out on what such regulations might look like exactly. All I am saying is that such a new beast would require new regulations and clarified rules of engagement \u2014 and that the states that are first movers in innovating this kind of \u201cmetamodern intellectual property\u201d are likely to attract a truckload of capital that can be used also by the state itself.\nThis last one is a tall order. But, as any respectable sociologist will tell you, states and markets develop together as new technological tropes emerge. The home of the next level of intellectual property will thus likely also become the center of metamodernism in the world, with the largest concentration of Protopian experiments.\nProtopian experiments are necessary to transform society from its modern trajectory of unsustainability into something more stable and desirable. And Protopian experiments could be funded by self-consciously speculative NFT bubbles.\nOr, put differently: If we can swindle ourselves into doing stupid things, we can also swindle ourselves into doing good things. It\u2019s a pyramid scheme turned on its head: taking speculation and directing its forces to those who imaginatively create better societies around the world. It\u2019s a weird path, for certain, but one that shouldn\u2019t be ignored.\nThat is why I can say \u2014 if not with certainty, then at least with some hope \u2014 that these flowers of evil can one day save the world.\nHanzi Freinacht is a political philosopher, historian, and sociologist, author of \u2018The Listening Society\u2019, \u2018Nordic Ideology\u2019 and the upcoming books \u2018The 6 Hidden Patterns of History\u2019 and \u2018Outcompeting Capitalism\u2019.

Clarke\nMy recent articles have centered around the concept of \u201cProtopia\u201d \u2014 the more flexible, dynamic, and abstract version of an imagined \u201cUtopia\u201d. If utopian dreams were too rigid and dangerous, Protopia at least provides us with shared hope, motivation, and a sense of direction.\nHow, then, should \u201cProtopians\u201d conduct themselves? Their key virtue must be, I shall argue, a certain quality of \u201csincere irony\u201d: it\u2019s abstract and playful enough to allow for new visions and new faith in the worlds our hearts know are possible \u2014 but at the same time self-critical and detached enough not to get stuck in na\u00efve and totalitarian projects.\nLadies and gents, fellow Protopians, I give you: Sincere Irony!\nProtopians Must Live by Sincere Irony In Order To Cultivate the Necessary Mutual Trust\nAs an author, how do I build trust with the reader? It\u2019s a valid question. Trust is hard to come by these days.\nMutual trust generally consists of four dimensions, I would argue:\ncompetence (or credibility, that you know the other person is capable of doing what you need them to do),\ngoodwill (that you have reason to believe in the benevolent intentions of the other),\nreliability (that what is agreed upon or claimed will be lived up to, most of the time), and\nalignment (that our interests align and don\u2019t contradict one another).\nIf all of these four are in place, a solid foundation of mutual trust can form, from which beneficial and creative collaborations can flourish. When people build trust in e.g. work relationships, they tend to forget about the last one. The secret is to reveal to others what you really want, and to ask the same of them. People will often gladly tell you. Find the people that want, not necessarily the exact same, but things that can be truly aligned with your goals. Then you know that they will genuinely wish for your success (in a deep and wide sense of the term), and they know that you genuinely wish for theirs.\nYou could arguably add a fifth dimension, which has to do with emotional report or resonance; that you feel seen and understood. This last aspect is important, but it often tends to be overemphasized in our time, as people are starved for authenticity and connection. It will likely fall into place if all the other four dimensions are there. What good, after all, is an emotional connection if you end up not being able to rely upon one another and if your goals collide?\nSo let\u2019s build trust. It\u2019s a tall order, but it\u2019s how we truly prosper as the social beings that we are. People find many, warranted or unwarranted, reasons to mistrust one another. And yet, lives are only as rich as the prevalence of trust. We move together, as people like to say, \u201cat the speed of trust\u201d. When it comes to the relationship between an author and a reader, trust is also necessary for the author\u2019s messages to be heard and sink in with the reader.\nStrange as it may sound, my main method for this trust-building with the reader is irony. Slightly crazy people like myself, who say unusual things, invoke a natural level of suspicion in readers and listeners. It just comes with the territory. But by adopting an ironic stance, I am conveying to you that I\u2019m not taking myself too seriously. There is room for critique, for questioning, for jokes, for open ends. That is the magic of irony, if done correctly and with the right kind of twinkle in the eye. If I went on like a frenzied agitator, you\u2019d be right to suspect me of tunnel vision, fanaticism, or hubris. The very fact that I\u2019m approaching the whole thing like more of a joke shows you that, in the greater scheme of things, at least I know when I am saying something somewhat outrageous, and I understand that, at the end of the day, the joke is on me. At least I know that while I do act as a comedian at times (this most Satanic of professions), I am also the butt of the joke. It shows you that I have at least some ability to take an outside perspective on how my message is perceived and taken in. Irony is, strangely enough, a token of my sanity. As it were, the use of irony grounds the dangerous electric wire of authenticity and hope, so that a stronger current can run through it. The sincerity of my message is carried forward through the channels of irony and (a lighthearted form of) sarcasm.\nIn the end, it\u2019s how much authentic life experience and thinking I manage to convey, how well I connect to who you are as a sensing and emotional being, that determines the effect of the article itself. This article itself also consists of four dimensions:\nthe ideas themselves,\nthe writing down of, packaging, and formulation of those ideas,\nthe angle through which the ideas are spread and marketed to the right readers, and\nthe reception and use/application of the ideas by real people in real situations.\nWhen push comes to shove, the only dimension that truly matters is the last one; the actual effect of the article in real people\u2019s lives, even those who didn\u2019t read it themselves, is what the article ultimately \u201cis\u201d. And that requires a certain quality of trust and something else, a quality pulsating through the pages and beyond.\nWhat, then, is that power running through the wires at the speed of trust? Again, it is authenticity. It is sincerity. The mastery over irony allows, at least in our cultural context of so many peddlers of messages and ideas, for sincerity to blossom. One has to display one\u2019s own weaknesses and limitations for people to know that what they\u2019re getting is, after all, the real thing. I\u2019m saving you the trouble of joking at my expense and revealing my weaknesses and intentions, because they\u2019re already revealed and analyzed asunder for your enjoyment (but do feel free to add your own critiques and jokes!). And this requires a certain stance, a stance of ironic sincerity, or sincere irony, whichever formulation you prefer. The two qualities contain one another; they are conjoined in cosmic dance, a yin-and-yang, a Shiva-Shakti act of revolutionary lovemaking.\nIt\u2019s a riskier and, I would argue, gutsier stance than being either ironic or directly sincere. It\u2019s a carefully crafted both-and. It\u2019s the jiu-jitsu path to sincere relatedness. If we\u2019re ironic about our life projects, then we can also allow ourselves a few big dreams, a bit of French revolution in the air, even a bit of religious fervor, of piety and faith. And that\u2019s something modern human beings have been lacking. Who would have thought that faith and piety would return through irony and its God of cruel jokes?\nFrank Sinatra. By Ike Vern.\nDid It Whose Way?\nOne can even argue that there\u2019s a three-step process of personal growth and cultural expression: first, authenticity/sincerity, second, irony/nihilism, and third, sincere irony. This third one comes in many flavors that capture slightly different sides of it: informed naivety, magical realism, playful struggle, pragmatic romanticism, even conservative radicalism.\nLet me illustrate this by way of Frank Sinatra\u2019s song, My Way. You remember the song, don\u2019t you? Sing it silently to yourself with the help of these lyrics. Yes, all five verses.\nAnd now, the end is near\nAnd so I face the final curtain\nMy friend, I\u2019ll say it clear\nI\u2019ll state my case, of which I\u2019m certain\nI\u2019ve lived a life that\u2019s full\nI traveled each and every highway\nAnd more, much more than this, I did it my way\nRegrets, I\u2019ve had a few\nBut then again, too few to mention\nI did what I had to do\nAnd saw it through without exemption\nI planned each charted course\nEach careful step along the byway\nAnd more, much more than this, I did it my way\nYes, there were times, I\u2019m sure you knew\nWhen I bit off more than I could chew\nBut through it all, when there was doubt\nI ate it up and spit it out\nI faced it all and I stood tall and did it my way\nI\u2019ve loved, I\u2019ve laughed and cried\nI\u2019ve had my fill, my share of losing\nAnd now, as tears subside\nI find it all so amusing\nTo think I did all that\nAnd may I say, not in a shy way\nOh, no, oh, no, not me, I did it my way\nFor what is a man, what has he got?\nIf not himself, then he has naught\nTo say the things he truly feels\nAnd not the words of one who kneels\nThe record shows\nI took the blows\nAnd did it my way\nYes, it was my way\nWhen we read this we hear a clarion call to authenticity, to being true to ourselves. We hear Sinatra, singing in 1969, at the fairly ripe age of 53, a modern anthem of American (and Western) individualism, reflecting a long and rich life experience. Even a bit of wisdom, albeit the Wisdom of the West. Like you, I\u2019ve also struggled to cut loose from societal expectations and inhibitions, and I too long to reflect back at my life, feeling, in truth, that I did it my way. I remember a good friend who would even listen to the song alone in the car during a period in her life where she was suffering from having chosen the wrong professional path for herself. Eventually, she did break free, went back to school, reeducated herself to be a medical doctor, and attained a fulfilling career somewhat late in life. And, in the end, I think she stopped listening to this old song, because she could truly say she did it her way. Here, you have a hymn to authenticity, to a sincere life: For what is a man, what has he got?/ If not himself, then he has naught / To say the things he truly feels / And not the words of one who kneels. Seriously, my eyes tear up when I hear that. The words do speak to me.\nBeautiful. Now consider these little factoids. Who actually wrote this song? It was not Frank Sinatra. It was Paul Anka, another singer (\u201cOooh pleeaase, staaay by me, Diiiaa-naaa!\u201d). And how old was he when he wrote this old man\u2019s reflection back on a life well-lived? 26. And what kind of life is Paul Anka known for having lived? One of Beverly Hills decadence with Swedish (etc.) Hollywood housewives who openly admitted to being gold diggers. Hardly a pinnacle of wisdom and authentic connection. Most likely, in a stroke of marketing genius, Anka placed the song in the reverberating vocal chords of the person from which it would be best received. The melody of the song was bought from an obscure Frenchman by Paul Anka for one dollar, and Sinatra showed up to their meeting with a number of mafioso types. Sinatra then went on to use the same song for the next 25 years or so, always doing a new comeback with a new farewell tour. Sinatra\u2019s daughter later revealed that he came to hate his signature song: \u201cHe didn\u2019t like it. That song stuck and he couldn\u2019t get it off his shoe. He always thought that song was self-serving and self-indulgent.\u201d\nYou\u2019d have to look far for an ounce of artistic authenticity behind this song. Every penny was squeezed systematically out of this piece of poetry. That\u2019s the song\u2019s real bottom line. The anthem of modern Western authenticity is a result of a marketing stunt. \u201cOnce you know the notes to sing, you can sing most anything\u201d, is a lyrics line from The Sound of Music. Well \u2014 once you know your marketing, you can sell most anything. There\u2019s another, darker, snippet of the Wisdom of the West.\nAnd now we\u2019re getting into the second stage: irony, or even nihilism. Here\u2019s the thing. Our senses only ever interact with surfaces. We so like to believe that we can feel into the deeper essences of the realities behind it all, but alas, experimental psychology lays its somber verdict: we respond to what reaches our senses \u2014 and nothing else. The rest we simply conjure up in our minds and emotional wiring. Automatic responses to stimuli. Endless facades, an inescapable prison of surfaces. The world is flat, and how we experience it can be endlessly manipulated because, ultimately, the mind itself is flat. And it is endlessly manipulated. If every situation is socially constructed, guess who rules the world? Whoever is the best wizard of Oz, whoever pulls the levers of social construction, whoever frames the situations within which events play out. The engineers of symbolic and situational machinery. Whoever knows their marketing. And what\u2019s the ultimate treat for the social constructor? It\u2019s to construct situations whereby authenticity is enacted. But even authenticity is an act. This is true down to the biochemical level: bigger pills will have greater placebo effects, and more suggestible people (often the spiritually and religiously inclined) will experience greater placebos. That is also to say, the more gullible people will.\nAnd so a righteous rebellion stirs in the ironic mind: \u201cNot me, I won\u2019t be the sucker.\u201d There\u2019s one born every minute, they say, but not this one. I\u2019ll question, I will tear down the facades, I will joke back, I will study the minutiae of social control, I will fight power structures, I will \u201cdeconstruct\u201d your messages and marketing, and I will see the ideology and self-interest behind your purported virtues and values. In the end, the joke won\u2019t be on me, it will be on whoever thought they could lure me in, fool me, and rule me.\nArmed with an ironic stance towards society and its surfaces, always revealing the emptiness behind the words, the techniques used to manipulate us, and the crude ever-present workings of power, this type of mind becomes like a Houdini, breaking out of the prisons that others have created for us with their subtle-strings-attached offerings. And so a form of grim nihilism creeps in. Frank Sinatra is not singing about being authentic: read the context of the song, and you notice he\u2019s really singing about consumer capitalism, about using the longing of people with suppressed dreams to make a buck and, while you\u2019re at it, get a Beverly Hills house and the gold digger wife that comes with it.\nBut, then again, if we\u2019re always dispelling the enacted enchantments of everyone else, where does this leave us? It leaves us in a place where there is really nothing left to believe in, to commit to, to live for, except the resistance and irony itself. That\u2019s a pretty high price to pay. And it may not be the most, well, constructive stance towards life.\nEnter a new sincerity; an ironic sincerity. This is the third stage in this simple model. What if you do realize exactly how Sinatra\u2019s song was deliberately constructed by a sly mind that wanted to play on your vulnerable strings \u2014 and you choose to still believe in it? What if there is a place beyond pure irony, an irony taken so far that it turns on itself? A skepticism that is skeptical even of itself? Then the irony inverts, and, like a well springing open, something else can flow from it: hope, idealism, sincerity, connection; yes, even childlike trust, religious faith, spiritual piety. This faith is made of other stuff than blind or naive belief; it grows from the ruins of an ironic revolt against the lies and obfuscations of the world. Its hymn is a subtle one, a vague whisper: After deconstruction, reconstruction must follow.\nSo once you\u2019ve learned to question the world and to pick it apart you begin, with sincere irony, to reconstruct it playfully. You begin learning the art of mastering the many placebo effects around us, for the benefit of our own happiness and sanity, and for the benefit of others. Another quote would be in order, one by the American novelist, David Foster Wallace:\n\u201cReal rebels, as far as I can see, risk disapproval. The old postmodern insurgents risked the gasp and squeal: shock, disgust, outrage, censorship, accusations of socialism, anarchism, nihilism. Today\u2019s risks are different. The new rebels might be artists willing to risk the yawn, the rolled eyes, the cool smile, the nudged ribs, the parody of gifted ironists, the \u2018Oh how banal.\u2019 To risk accusations of sentimentality, melodrama. Of overcredulity. Of softness. Of willingness to be suckered by a world of lurkers and starers who fear gaze and ridicule above imprisonment without law. Who knows.\u201d\nExactly. This is sincere irony expressed better than I could have caught it. It\u2019s from his A Supposedly Fun Thing I\u2019ll Never Do Again: Essays and Arguments, published in 1998. This was a voice ahead of its time. By making ourselves intentionally gullible, for just a moment, we get all the real (even biochemically observable) advantages of a stronger placebo effect. One such placebo effect is happiness, optimism, a sense of direction, a sense of agency, and even free will, a higher \u201csubjective state\u201d in everyday life.\nWe meet Morpheus trying to peddle us a red pill (the grim truth), and sure, what the hell, we\u2019ll take it. But! Then we swiftly snatch the blue one (happy illusion) out of his other hand and gobble it down, too, before he can stop us. If Neo would have done that, he would have beaten the Matrix much more easily, and he would have had more fun along the way, too. Too bad nobody told him about that third option, the ironically sincere one.\nHow does being sincerely ironic empower us, then? Think about it. If you internalize the ironic ridicule of others before they have a chance of applying it to you, you can more easily shrug it off; you can work from a place of near invulnerability, and thus dare to be truly vulnerable, and thus bravely constructive, finding and suggesting new pathways for yourself and society. Mastery over irony-turned-on-itself allows for new sincerity. And extreme sincerity even becomes the sharpest weapon of irony, because it\u2019s just so damn outrageous. This does not shield you from constructive criticism; rather it opens you up to it, because you always-already expect to be incomplete, to be open-ended, to be improved upon.\nIn the face of every \u201chow dare you!\u201d that inevitably comes your way, irony shields you. You are not shielded in the sense that \u201cI tense up and lock it outside\u201d. It\u2019s more like an electric wire that carries the current of your dearest truths (again, open-ended truths to be improved upon by you, the reader). Yes, you will be laughed at and looked down upon, accused of \u201ccringe\u201d, eyes will be rolled, and all of that. But the very acknowledgment of that fact releases a creative spark, a freedom of expression that runs deeper than any bill of rights could guarantee.\nAnd so I can say, with all the force of conviction, that sincere irony, in the hands of sublimely mediocre and ridiculously ordinary people, will change the face of the world. Because that\u2019s where the wild things are. The sincerely ironic can reconstruct the world by virtue of their untamed imagination, which comes with the trust they build. The child returns; the beast is unleashed.\nWhere, then, does this leave us in regard to Frank Sinatra\u2019s song? Well, look at it this way: The fact that the conception of the song and its powerful lyrics involved a clever marketing stunt does not need to take anything away from its quality of beauty. If it is true that all that ever reaches us is not the inherent \u201cessence\u201d of the thing we experience, but rather a surface that stimulates something in us, a surface that touches our senses and moves something inside of us \u2014 then does it not follow that the quality of the song belongs to the personal experience of the listener, rather than to the motives of its creators? Or, put differently, does not the acknowledgment of the fact that \u201call is surface\u201d carry within itself the proposition that authentic expression can be found in anything that plays the strings of our soul, no matter for what reason?\nAgain, you can see that we\u2019re taking the blue pill, after we\u2019ve taken the red one. Stir, and it\u2019s a purple cocktail, an elixir from the very crossroads of fact and fiction. Hence, it is by enriching our own capacity to experience the magic of reality that we can reclaim the qualities of hope, of progress, of faith, even after our ironic distancing from them. And so we can begin to find the nuggets of beauty in the cultural ruins that irony and nihilism leave behind: My Way may not be the result of the trembling heart of Frank Sinatra looking back upon his life, but it is the result of the sense of freedom and individual dignity offered by American life of that period, for all of its faults and vices. It hits home for many of us because it still expresses this collective experience, without which the song could never have been imagined in the first place. And so, we can simply enjoy it with good conscience, taking the power back of our own construction of meaning in the world; intentionally making ourselves credulous, gullible for just a moment. We can use it to, among other things, give our \u201csubjective state\u201d a little boost.\nSo after \u201cdeconstructing\u201d and picking apart the many tricks played upon us, we can now \u201creconstruct\u201d new tricks for the sake of magic and direction in our lives, and in the world around us. We can become our own wizards of Oz (and of one another), and begin to deliberately run the machinery of our own illusions, re-enchanting reality. Dorothy Gale found a little unassuming man behind the machinery that ran the smokescreens of the \u201cgreat wizard of Oz\u201d, and shouted accusingly \u201cYou\u2019re a bad man!\u201d, angry for having been fooled. To which he replied: \u201cI\u2019m not a bad man, just a bad wizard\u201d. In the end, the wizard turned out to be (sublimely) mediocre, like the rest of us. But we can take up the mantle of all dispelled conjurors, and together co-create a more enchanted reality to live in. Dorothy could have stayed behind the curtains and learned a thing or two about running the machine herself. Would that prospect not lead us towards a more compelling open horizon than pure irony? We have worlds to construct, always finding new sources of magic. That is ultimately the reason I feel this stance, sincere irony, can salvage our souls and let us struggle playfully together towards beautifully impossible but tremendously important goals. Again, at the end of irony, at its omega point, when skepticism is turned even on itself, it brings that spark of the creative imagination that belongs only to the faithful.\nPhoto by Diana Vargas on Unsplash\nJesus: Lost and Found\nAt one point or another, I suppose it is inevitable that we should ruin this dinner party by talking about religion. As William James, this American \u201cfather of sociology\u201d, wrote in his 1902 The Varieties of Religious Experience: \u201cReligion, whatever it is, is man\u2019s total reaction upon life\u201d. It\u2019s how we relate to the whole. Also known as: \u201cthe question of life, the universe, and everything\u201d. Or, simply: What is of ultimate significance? What is, when all is said and done, truly important?\nLet\u2019s keep this broad view of what religion is in mind. What, then, can a sincerely ironic stance do for our religious relationship to reality, ourselves, life, the universe, and everything? Where does it leave that \u201cfaith\u201d we were just speaking of?\nHere, you can see a similar but distinct progression as the one outlined above: from sincere belief, through nihilism and skepticism, towards sincere irony. If sincerity would mean something like \u201cbelieve in Jesus as the son of God, and as your personal savior who made miracles happen\u201d where God is the ultimate source of all true, good, and beautiful in the world and the everpresent creator of it all, the nihilistic stance is simply to not believe in any of that: it\u2019s bullshit.\nAnd, of course, it is bullshit. Jesus couldn\u2019t heal the sick, turn water into wine, or walk on water, nor was he born by a virgin, nor was he the son of God, nor was he resurrected. Mohammed couldn\u2019t move a mountain, and Buddha didn\u2019t fly around and cast fireballs (yep, that\u2019s a thing in the scriptures); he didn\u2019t even teleport across the Ganges. And even if God was in the world making miracles happen, why on earth would the focus be on wine and fireworks, or getting teenagers pregnant without consent (i.e. the Virgin Mary)? It\u2019s preposterous not only at the level of empirical claims; it\u2019s preposterous even at an existential and spiritual level, just too dumb to do any notion of God or [other placeholder of ultimate significance] any justice.\nYeah, yeah, of course we don\u2019t believe in that stuff. But there are mysteries, things beyond our comprehension, things like\u2026 special and difficult-to-understand capabilities of rare, accomplished, spiritual masters, right? Things like Rupert Sheldrake\u2019s biology of morphic fields, new frontiers of science that rediscover spiritual perennial truths beyond the rational mind. Or at least the possibility thereof. There are synchronicities and serendipities too unlikely to have occurred naturally. There are energies. Flows.\nNo, it\u2019s all bullshit. There aren\u2019t any miracles. Not even just a little, not even in a profound transrational sense, not even in the distant East. So stop it. No, Ruper Sheldrake\u2019s theory of telepathic dogs isn\u2019t correct. There aren\u2019t any morphic fields and dogs aren\u2019t telepathic. Certainly, with Joseph Campbell, that great interpreter of myths, we can look at \u201cwalking on water\u201d as a metaphor for \u201cmastering our unconscious\u201d and so on; but believing in the miracle itself very demonstrably does harm. I won\u2019t bore you with the work of the \u201cnew atheists\u201d who labor to show this, but they do have a point.\nIt can feel a bit brutal, but it\u2019s time to take the red pill. We live in a world entirely devoid of all magic and all miracles. That is to say, we live in a world where things are caused by other things in replicable, if complex, manners. That\u2019s the same as understanding that there are no nooks and crannies left of magic or miracles, not even at farthest reaches of the mind, the universe, the far East, life, and everything. All in this sense \u201cmetaphysical\u201d claims of all the religions are entirely false; and there is really no need for a shred of mercy or sentimentality about it.\nWell yes, I see what you\u2019re saying Hanzi, but\u2026\nNo, seriously, stop it. You\u2019re not doing yourself or anyone else any favors with that stuff. There is no \u201cbut\u201d, no \u201cboth and\u201d here, no \u201chigher synthesis\u201d, no hidden pattern in profound symbols that reveals an esoteric truth that unlocks your chosenness, no meditative insight that saves the metaphysical claims of any of the religions\u2026 No multiperspectivalism that puts you into contact with the indigenous spirit worlds. No healing practice that sends energies through the deepest layers of consciousness across continents.\nThat\u2019s what killing God feels like: it\u2019s a brutal dead end. It\u2019s not supposed to feel good or right. It just is what it is: the death of ideas that are false. And then we go after all the saints and sages (they\u2019re mediocre), every miracle, every siddhi, every magic residual in the known universe. Kill, kill, kill. Die, die, die.\nAnd together with the magic, we also kill off all crazy guru abuses, many of the cults (but cults can and do still show up in political and self-development guises), and our tendency to disregard and disrespect science. We also kill off New Age abuse of desperate people, the cruel commercialization of the human soul where sad people pay for expensive crystals. Oh yeah, and then we kill the notion of \u201cthe soul\u201d because that\u2019s also magical thinking. Santa, too.\nAnd now, if the red pill has been properly gobbled down, and only then, do we take the blue pill. It\u2019s the ultimate marshmallow test of humanity. Real magic is felt, not believed. Or let me restate that a bit more precisely: Magic is an experiential, not a cognitive, category.\nWe can reconstruct God, yes, but only after we\u2019re done properly killing them. Now, we are free to reconstruct religion, to delve head-first into the faith of the faithless (with the words of the philosopher Simon Critchley).\nSo the answer to the question of life, the universe, and everything, can indeed be a better one than an absurd \u201c42\u201d. Once you\u2019ve grounded the wire of spirituality with relentless skepticism and ironic distance and the most ruthless nihilism imaginable, you can begin to reclaim the spiritual realm. If you want to be crude about it, you could say that spiritual experience exists within and beyond the traditional religions, but that it becomes a good and constructive force in our day and age only at the other side of atheism. By first mastering atheism, for all of its unimaginative and judgmental simple-mindedness, we can begin to unleash the power of spirituality in our lives and beyond. Religion is recaptured from the monster of modern life.\nEnter sincere irony: the teachings of ironic prophets. The religions that can grow and prosper in this realm aren\u2019t exactly religions as we normally think of them. They excavate and revive not the metaphysical and miraculous claims of the contemplative traditions of religions, but their existential truths. And yes, the religions are true, they were right, as all of them point to insights that are correct but which modern everyday life is oblivious of.\nTake Jesus, for example. It is true that we lost him as the literal son of a heavenly father and cosmic creator in our merciless purge of all magic from the world. We lost him, of course, in the sense that we no longer believe in what are, if you\u2019re entirely sober about it, childish bullshit fairy tales. But now we can find him again, in a more mature and adult relationship. He\u2019s not our savior or daddy figure. But he\u2019s not entirely wrong, either: non-judgment and forgiveness really are higher truths if you look at it, there are very good reasons indeed to try to find universal love for all and to live by it; and, yes, we really are sinners in that we shouldn\u2019t think of ourselves as inherently good but rather become good by always seeing how we are flawed and limited in our moral capacities. And yes, there really is a whole kingdom of God within us, waiting to be discovered in the higher reaches of our inner subjective states which also reach into the depth and core of our being. And yes, people who came before us really did go through torture for us to be here, so a little damn gratitude wouldn\u2019t be such a bad idea. As far as I can see, Jesus has more correct and insightful things to say than almost anyone I can think of.\nLikewise, with the Buddha, we can see that you literally can advance through the stages of meditative absorption if you diligently practice meditation, and that this even shows on a brain scanner. And yes, the stages are roughly yet correctly described and they can be taught and learned. And yes, our desires are always functions of our own minds and end up being frustrated one way or another, and we do well to transform their nature towards becoming less self-centered. And yes, we really do experience a loss of the discrete \u201csense of self\u201d if we experience the deeper meditative and \u201chigher\u201d inner states. And all experience, pleasurable or painful, even the sense of a separate soul, really does melt away in a radical emptiness if we study it closely and attentively enough. Once we identify with the deeper layers of the mind, and with the consciousness of which we are a part, we can easily see that doing harm to others, to anyone, is in a sense doing harm to ourselves. So even the law of Karma has something going for it: What goes around comes around. That\u2019s true even on a practical level. On average and over time, we tend to benefit from kind actions, when they are performed with discernment. The more we focus on others, the easier time we usually have maintaining a good subjective state ourselves, and genuinely kind actions tend to reward us with nice surprises later down the road, if seldom in the ways we expected. Even if counter-examples show up in the short run (we try to be kind and feel cheated, etc.), karma is certainly worth believing in, sincerely.\nAnd with Islam we can experience a sense of wholeness or oneness that has indeed been shown empirically to support happiness and wellbeing (whereas the bleak belief structures of Buddhism, \u201ceverything is suffering\u201d, actually tend to make you less happy unless paired with extensive contemplative practice). By focusing on one principle, one God, one path, we can feel more at home in the universe. Research has even shown that Muslims have the highest score of sense of \u201coneness\u201d (which in turn correlates with life satisfaction) and atheists have the lowest. Oneness is a genuinely psychologically helpful fiction, like the belief in free will. People feel better and are healthier if they believe in free will, even if it factually speaking doesn\u2019t exist. You get a sense of direction and control, and that affects how your mind self-organizes and avoids dumb excuses. Praise Allah for those placebo effects!\nWith indigenous religions and rituals, we can begin to reconnect to our bodies, to our communities, to nature, to the complexities of the world around us. We can come into contact with spirit worlds, not as a source of magic in the literal sense, but as a source of relationality and connection, not to mention a sense of enchantment. How inventive we must be, and how attentive to respecting the wisdom of the oldest cultures on the planet, to tap into this ancient homestead of the human psyche! Animist worldviews, for all their differences between them, were in some way or form how humans lived and expressed themselves for at least tens of thousands of years. It does make sense to think that what humans adapted to for so long also makes sense at a psychological level, more so than our modern lives. Arguably, the more we connect to this wisdom, the greater role can also be played by indigenous wisdom in creating new forms of sustainable life and community.\nI would even include, among the things we can playfully reconstruct, the zeal of the revolutionary, of the communist, the anarchist: the belief in the possibility of overturning the injustices of society, of imagining new worlds for humans to live in. This is the fire of the French revolution and its sense that this moment can birth new worlds through an uncompromising commitment to justice. Many of the people who were part of anarchist Catalonia in the 1930s later remembered it as the happiest and most beautiful days of their lives. What a source of energy and agency such \u201crevolutionary happiness\u201d can bring! \u201cThe irrepressible lightness and joy of being communist\u201d as philosophers Hardt and Negri once wrote about, can be channeled, if it is only approached responsibly; that is to say, playfully and ironically. And, of course, one must understand that there is no such thing as what Leon Trotsky called \u201cthe permanent revolution\u201d; revolution occurs in moments of seismic change, in social and psychological earthquakes; it is analogous to falling in love, as discussed by the Italian sociologist Francesco Alberoni. Between such \u201cmoments of movement\u201d, there is institution, habit \u2014 longer stretches of mediocrity. But still, these moments \u2014 of the dramatic, the tremendous, the musical \u2014 are real enough, and they can be sparked. They really do happen in people\u2019s lives; a sense of complete, shared ecstasy taking over one\u2019s entire being, and they really can change society.\nAnd beyond the political passions that stir the soul, even the occult can be played with: dark rituals, satanic cabaals, sex magic, and so on. Sure, the Order of the Golden Dawn never quite delivered on its mysteries and magic spells, nor did any of the esoteric groups of the last turn of the century. But reinvented magical rituals that draw upon the inner beast and its carnal desires, unfiltered dreams, and raw emotions can certainly release strong forces in our lives, at least for short, revolutionary moments. For what it\u2019s worth, they inspired rock bands by the dozen, too. The variety of practices called \u201cchaos magick\u201d involves making ourselves entirely suggestible, entirely open to new beliefs, so as to actively reshape our own minds. The occult paths can help us hack our minds, dramatically and profoundly: they include the \u201cfuck like a beast\u201d insight to a degree that Christianity and classical (Theravadan) Buddhism did not. Or, less drastically, there is the ongoing popularization of BDSM and sex-positive events. Tantric sex is part of such explorations, as is tantra in the deeper and original sense (spirituality beginning from the embodied) and the use of sacred symbols. Pagan revivals of Odin and summer solstice rituals can also play a part here, but make sure not to link these to those crazy far-right ideas.\nAnd, of course, there\u2019s the whole reinvention of psychedelic culture and practice, making it more therapeutic, science-based, and responsible (a promising area \u2014 I\u2019m also connected to the Psychedelic Society in the UK and respect their work \u2014 but it is one in which I\u2019d like to see more caution and healthy conservatism; addiction and psychiatric harm are real things, as are abuses within this field). However, I\u2019ll leave that last discussion to others.\nSimply stated: There are a lot of blue pills to take, and they can bring us closer to truth, rather than farther away from it. This includes \u201ctransrational\u201d truth; existential truths that lie beyond our analytical minds, but somehow ring true from a place within and beyond us.\nOh, let\u2019s be honest \u2014 how we long for the ecstatic, for some real magic in our lives, for what life was supposed to be! And \u2014 as the mystical traditions taught, and the religions hinted at in their mythologies \u2014 truth brings us closer to magic, while illusion has it that the world is plain and mundane. In that sense, all the religions were right, and today\u2019s prevailing atheist-rationalist-materialist-reductionist-scientist worldview is false.\nPhoto by Alain Pham on Unsplash\nPraise the Shallow\nBy now I imagine a question may come to mind for some readers, the more seriously religious ones. One might think that Hanzi takes a too sloppy and superficial view of religion, one that does not allow for serious commitment and depth that pertains to following one particular path. Should, then, religion and spirituality always remain piecemeal, only a collage of different trends that happen to pop up on the internet? What about going deep into and following a tradition, a contemplative path set by centuries of hard-earned human experience of the practitioners before us? Will deeper truths really reveal themselves to us if we treat these human accomplishments without respect? There\u2019s Kierkegaard\u2019s old \u201ceither-or\u201d: make up your damned mind and take a leap of faith to live for something, and commit to that path! Or, with another saying that recurs these days from serious spiritual practitioners and followers of a path: \u201cYou have to eat the whole fish.\u201d That is to say, to reap the full benefits of a spiritual path, of a contemplative religion or form of mysticism, you have to work according to the internal logic of that path and stay on it, like any good training program. Otherwise, it\u2019s like you\u2019re hopping back and forth from golf to basketball to chess \u2014 and neither path will open up and reveal its secrets to you, and none of them will yield to mastery. And it\u2019s mastery that transforms you.\nOkay, fair point. Well, the problem is \u2014 and I\u2019ve seen this again and again \u2014 that the whole fish eats you. You think you\u2019re going on a deep spiritual path, with your critical mind intact, but before you know it, you\u2019re posting childish gobbledygook about miracles on Facebook to prove that your religion is the true one after all. You have lost touch with all shared reality, and as such you\u2019ve lost all relevance to the world we live in. Why does this happen? Because you invest your life\u2019s entire project in the narrative of one religion, to the extent that you so badly want all of its premises to be true, to be The Truth. In the end, at some deep level, you sell out the truth for some emotional and spiritual candy bars (for some inner rewards).\nThere\u2019s a certain threshold we can pass, a great price to pay: a certain kind of sanity we\u2019ll likely never recover. You thought you were an intrepid explorer of the kingdom within, but what you\u2019ve become is actually no different from a Flat Earther (the folks who literally think the earth is flat, it\u2019s a big thing these days). And then you start trying to convert everyone else to your beliefs, while bankrupting your own philosophy by tying it to your blatantly incorrect beliefs.\nI\u2019m not saying we can\u2019t go deep into one tradition, or that it should always be avoided. All I am saying is that taking the red pill first, and then trying out several blue pills, is the safer and more productive way of being religious. From a position of sincere irony, you can then go deeper and deeper into the paths that open to you. You make certain that you don\u2019t get sucked into one tunnel-visioned perspective, consuming you like a raw, rattling fish.\nMany of these topics of \u201creinventing religion\u201d have been explored by other works, like my friend Nick Jankel\u2019s Spiritual Atheist, or why not Jamie Wheal\u2019s Recapture the Rapture, and this is not an article on theology or religion. Cognitive scientist John Vervaeke has labored extensively to meet the meaning-crisis with a reinvention of religion for our time, sketching the deep structures of a reconstructed religiosity. Suffice to say here that sincere irony allows for the multi-pronged open exploration of faith, for the re-enchantment of a world left in spiritual shambles after the death of God. As such, we can meditate, pray, dream, play, and practice what Layman Pascal calls our \u201cspiritual style\u201d with no sense of shame or embarrassment, with no apologies made.\nWe can even try to speak our own truths about the great cosmic joke, and become ironic prophets of our own \u2014 and of one another. As such, the field of religion, of all of the religions and their perennial wisdoms (which are related but distinct), even of revolutions and the occult, open up to us. We can begin to practice piety in a space that is safer and compatible not only with modern science, but also with critical thinking, and with the sincere irony that increasingly marks our digital age.\nBut remember. All the religious and spiritual experiences of the world will not efface broken dishwashers and people cutting in line at the bus stop. Religion and zeal can be reinvented and rediscovered with sincere irony, as can wisdom, faith, rapture, ritual, mystery, and contemplation, but they only ever return us, after some wild roller coaster rides through passion, over transcendence, and into inner peace, to a (hopefully) sublime mediocrity. It is this sublime mediocrity, this inescapable \u201cground of being\u201d, that we\u2019re perfecting.\nSo, once you\u2019ve truly killed God, you can take the blue pill and begin to use those sought-after both-ands of science and spirituality of the left and right hemispheres of the brain. Here, you can combine ruthless reason with the perfectly unreasonable longings of the (scientifically speaking, non-existent) soul. Before the proper death of God, magic will always sneak in, not as a wonderful re-enchantment of the cosmos, but as an endless source of deceit and disappointment. Even the saint, even the prophet, is mediocre. In the end, even Jesus doesn\u2019t look a lot like Jesus (simple thought experiment: what would you think of a guy who, in a fit of self-righteous rage, turned over the table of some poor tourist trinket vendors at a cathedral?). And that\u2019s why we need to lose him \u2014 and then find him, again and again. And that\u2019s the real miracle of religion: You can kill God, you can even crucify Him and mock Him with a crown of thorns while you\u2019re at it, and He still shows up three days later, happy to go.\nIf God is always on His way to the guillotine, if He\u2019s always beheaded and overturned by a new revolution of the critical mind, of new perspectives and life experiences, what you get is The Headless God. An open-ended God. A God of exploration. Now that is the God that\u2019s left even after the crudest murders of the sacred, and that\u2019s a God truly worth worshipping. If being whacked by the critical mind, if being crucified and denied, if being killed and mocked, still doesn\u2019t kill you and you are still reborn, still wearing the crown of thorns, well then at least my hat\u2019s off and I\u2019m on my knees before you, ready to give you everything. With this view of the divine, \u201cthe sacred\u201d is revealed through a relentless series of iconoclasms.\nThis sincerely ironic reconstruction of faith goes beyond the tired clich\u00e9 of \u201cspiritual but not religious\u201d (which is, for many reasons we needn\u2019t belabor, a dead end): it helps us to reinvent not only spirituality (the experience and expression of the higher inner states), but religion itself (the meaning-making fabric of our relatedness to reality). Religion is redefined; it escapes its confines and combines with art, science, and critical thinking; it becomes tailored to the Internet age and to every unique person and to every context, to every moment. Not every moment and aspect of life can realistically be \u201cspiritual\u201d\u2026 But we all do have some kind of \u201creligion\u201d. Hence, rather than trying to be \u201cspiritual but not religious\u201d, we should admit that we\u2019ve been \u201creligious but not (always) spiritual\u201d all along. If that makes sense.\nSincere irony can rescue God. And then God does save our fallen souls at the auspicious crossroads of fact and fiction. Isn\u2019t that sublimely mediocre?\nPhoto by Jon Tyson on Unsplash\nThe Sound of Both Ands Clapping\nAs a last note on this, I\u2019d like to mine the gold strains of some other both-ands that are closely related to sincere irony.\nA famous Zen koan asks \u201cWhat is the sound of one hand clapping?\u201d. The Zen koans were designed to radically break us out of our conceptual minds and lead us into the realm of pure paradox and the strokes of wordless insight that thrive there. Perhaps at a somewhat less profound level, there are paradoxical both-ands that capture different aspects of the \u201coscillation\u201d between irony and sincerity. Some of these have been proposed by the Dutch art scholars, Timotheus Vermeulen and Robin van der Akker: pragmatic romanticism, informed naivety, and magical realism.\nNow, we have to choose our both-ands carefully. Not all both-ands are born equal. The point is that the two seemingly opposite elements must conflict in a manner that sparks a desirable field of possibilities. So, you cannot walk around both-anding just anything and think that you have achieved a greater synthesis or wisdom. Both rob the bank and give to the poor? Well, it\u2019s good enough for a fairy tale about Robin Hood, but probably not a good idea in reality. Both being nationalist and socialist? Well, that spells National Socialism, a.k.a. Nazism.\nAs mentioned, the philosopher Kierkegaard titled his most famous work \u201ceither or\u201d: you have to make up your mind sometimes, take a leap of faith, take a stand, to truly live in authenticity. But the point here is that both-and contains either-or; but either-or does not contain both-and.\nIf you\u2019ll allow me a bit of tangled reasoning:\nIt\u2019s not either \u201cboth-and\u201d or \u201ceither-or\u201d;\nit\u2019s both \u201cboth-and\u201d and \u201ceither-or\u201d.\nIt\u2019s both-and with discernment.\nAll of this is just to say that there are productive and destructive paradoxes; so you cannot combine just any contradiction arbitrarily (again, combining both toilet and kitchen is not a mark of wisdom). To do both-ands well, you have to define the two opposing elements non-arbitrarily, in manners that make sense on a deeper level that enriches both sides. And you do this by first differentiating between the two, separating them out fully, and only then do you experiment with combining them. You differentiate, and then you reintegrate where possible and desirable.\nLet\u2019s get started with some more both-ands, then. Good ones, not bad ones.\nPragmatic Romanticism\nPragmatic romanticism is the principle of both taking up an unapologetically romantic stance towards life, like those passionate painters, poets, and philosophers of Romanticism in the 19th century, and to do so as pragmatically as humanly possible. Yes, life should be enchanted, and yes, you have to follow that unique inner spark and express your individuality, because only that can truly bring harmony between what is within and what is around us. Yes, mountaineering and (with the words of Jamie Wheal) \u201crecapturing the rapture\u201d of nature lead to a sense of the dramatic! The tremendous! The cosmic images of the Hubble space telescope speak to us, and then they can speak through us, as we channel our inspiration into the world. The romantic moment, be it of spiritual bliss, creative insight, or even falling in love, makes the entirety of the world and its suffering somehow \u201cworth it\u201d. And yet \u2014 none of that will by itself resolve, for instance, the climate crisis. And the climate crisis will sweep much of the potential for such beauty off the face of the Earth. Thus, it is by stretching the soul between these two poles, by holding on to them both at once, that one can create movements that work from the spirit of the romantic, and towards real solutions. But think about it: Do you think that being purely pragmatic is enough? Where will the strokes of genius come from? Where will the tenacity to go that extra mile come from? Where will the inspiration that fuels profound transformation of the entire economy and way of life come from? It comes from the bleeding heart, from a sense of tragedy, from those moments when we are in love with life. There is, in this sense, nothing more pragmatic than pure, unapologetic romanticism. Pragmatism is lost without love and rapture, without the romantic. But the moments of rapture cannot sustain themselves. A climate movement, for instance, can only be truly successful if it deliberately uses the love for and mystery of nature to fuel human engagement with science, policy, and the dirtiest of all: politics. (The same could be said, by the way, of marriage.) So if the world has been divided between pragmatists and romantic souls, it appears that a most fruitful paradox to meditate upon becomes pragmatic romanticism. The two may perhaps never be happily married, but in the both-and that attempts to grasp them in one embrace, there is creativity and hope to be found.\nInformed Naivety\nInformed naivety is the both-and of knowing that what you believe in is indeed naive, seeing how it is \u201cimpossible\u201d, but still working from that vision because it will still move things in the right direction. So maybe it is naive to think that climate change can be curbed, or that political polarization can be mitigated and people can begin to understand one another better, or that we can create free and fair solarpunk autonomous zones of postcapitalism and distributed governance. But the very fact that people do insist on working naively on those issues means that potentials emerge that otherwise wouldn\u2019t have. The world is run and reproduced by realists, but it is transformed, bit by bit, by dreamers. The sci-fi author Ursula Le Guin once noted that, in times prior to democracy, the end of the divine right of kings was unimaginable, and that today, the end of capitalism is equally so. Yet, democracy did emerge, once the conditions were ripe for it. It is by being students of such conditions of transformation and change that we can adopt and live by an informed naivety. Such naivety keeps some of our childlike qualities, like innocence and directness of experience, but attempts to marry them to the discerning and protective mind of the educated adult. It keeps the door open to alternatives, to other worlds, and it feeds our (non-existent) souls with hope and inspiration. The cypherpunks and the hackers of the Ethereum blockchain community serve as an example: The deeper they delve into computation and the crude incentives of economic modeling and finance, the more they can begin to imagine radically different futures of freedom and equality under decentralized cooperation.\nMagical Realism\nMagical realism you might have heard of already: It\u2019s a big thing in literature, with authors like Haruki Murakami (author of e.g. Kafka on the Shore, 2005) combining a bit of social realism, and renderings of everyday life and history, with magical interruptions that break through common reality, in a sense commenting upon it and helping us reach deeper beneath its surfaces. And so boring bus rides and visits to libraries are combined with talking cats and forces of fate that drive the story: \u201cYour problem is that your shadow is a bit \u2014 how should I put it? Faint.\u201d comments the black tomcat. It speaks to something many of us can recognize, a lacking sense of fullness when we\u2019re not following our inner path, but it couldn\u2019t have been as succinctly described without the invocation of magic into the narrative, in this case talking cats and thinned-out shadows. This has been an influential movement around the world, particularly in Latin American 20th century literature. Literary scholars are crazy about it and love to write dissertations on the topic. But in this context, I\u2019m thinking of magical realism in the sense where it is applied to life itself, even beyond the realm of art and literature. Yes, we may need to \u201cstick to reality\u201d to remain sane and effective; but our experienced reality is always a projection of our minds, as cognitive science has revealed with increasing clarity. And, as discussed, our minds are more pliable and plastic than we normally imagine, so we can always play with how the world is perceived, interpreted, and participated in. We have available to us the vast potentials of magic and mystery; and, indeed, the farther we travel into the true mechanisms of reality, the farther reaches of relativity, quantum physics, of cosmology, of big history, of complexity, of studies of consciousness and cognition, of sociology, the more mysterious it all actually seems, and the more tools of re-enchantment indeed become available. This is actually a path taken by some of the most forward-thinking performance magicians of our day and age: My friend, Ferdinando Buscema, loves to reveal some of the \u201cmagic\u201d behind his tricks, and, in that same move, he ironically makes the tricks seem yet more magical. As such, he combines his background as a mechanical engineer with the art of magic. Ferdinando was inspired by TechGnosis, a 1998 book by Erik Davis, which explores the historical connection between technology and magic and a deep view of cyberculture; indeed, he was inspired to such a degree that he committed the entire book to his active memory, word for word, including the position of each word on each page, in effect carrying the book with him at all times. There is magic in technology, and technology in magic. So magical realism does not only use magic to re-enchant the world of crude physics and reason; it uses crude mechanics to enhance our connection to the magical. In the mathematician Warren Weaver\u2019s 1949 article \u201cScience and Complexity\u201d, he guides us through the development of science, through mechanical physics (things that are sure to occur), to statistical chemistry (things that are likely to occur), to complexity in life and society: that which seems unlikely, impossible even, but nevertheless occurs despite it all. The magical, the emergent, sparks from building step by step on the crudest and simplest rules. And strangely, that somehow makes it even more enchanted, even more connected to the basic movements and regularities of the cosmos. The understanding of complexity as a field of science springs from crude mechanics and reductive physics, and yet, from that very same complexity, springs what appears to be magic.\nEach of the above (pragmatic romanticism, informed naivety, and magical realism) somehow relates to the difficult interplay between the left and right hemispheres of the brain. We need to practice stretching our minds between two polarities: from profound enchantment and sense of intuition, wholeness, and radical openness on one hand (right hemisphere), to understanding complexity and the crudest scientific and logical discernment on the other (left hemisphere). It\u2019s interesting to notice how great resistance there is to this simple insight. The world of humans consists almost entirely of people of one type or the other \u2014 those that seek to save science, realism, and reason from magic, idealism, and woo woo, or those that seek to save the spiritual realm from cynicism, scientism, and reductionism. In the greater scheme of things, it\u2019s okay that different people take different positions on one side or another of this polarity, even different cultures do, as it\u2019s part of a greater oscillation that runs through society at large. But for sublime mediocrity to be served best in our own lives, the richest position by far is an uncompromising, but calibrated, both-and.\nOther Both-Ands\nExcept for these three both-ands, you can extend the list. Here are some suggestions of my own: the crossroads of fact and fiction, struggle-reborn-as-play, conservative radicalism, game change, and, of course, sublime mediocrity.\nThe \u201ccrossroads of fact and fiction\u201d is the place where dabs of fiction are used to speak more truly and clearly about facts and reality.\nStruggle-reborn-as-play is when we deepen the sense of our struggles for a kinder and more just world to the point where the love of and gratefulness towards the world becomes apparent as the very underlying source of these same struggles, so that they suddenly appear less like a war and more like a playful experiment. We become \u201chappy revolutionaries\u201d, committed to and flowing from what social theorist Jason Storm has called \u201crevolutionary happiness\u201d.\nConservative radicalism is when you commit fully to transforming society, but take a careful and gradual stance towards how radical transformation can realistically come about.\nGame change (as described in detail in my other work) is when you accept that life is a game with winners and losers, but still think it\u2019s an unjust game, and resolve to change that game for the better in regards to all of its players.\nAnd beyond that, there are more dangerous but still potentially fruitful concepts that we should only approach with the greatest caution, because they can easily misfire and bring \u201cthe worst of both worlds\u201d: sneaky kindness, hierarchical equality, religious nihilism, or idealistic machiavellianism. Without venturing into these, explore them at your own peril. My other work certainly tries to venture into these treacherous waters and time will tell if I overstretched.\nWrathful compassion is another somewhat risky one. I got it from a friend, Anasuya Sengupta, who is, in my own estimation, an exceedingly accomplished social justice activist. She\u2019s the kind of person that many feminists and (anti-)postcolonialists aspire to be; always very enmeshed in the down-to-earth duty to balance out the injustices of the web and of information, always taking up new projects to help people in need in real communities around the world, and always very well informed and thoughtful in her theoretical underpinnings and methods of collaboration. Never complaining or bitter, even in the face of harsh difficulties, always constructive, active, and brave. If you ask her about the source of this admirable and rare level of engagement, she speaks of that quality of \u201cwrathful compassion\u201d. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d recommend it for everyone: it requires the wrath to be truly felt and embodied, and then connected to a source of compassion that flows from a genuine sense of injustice. In theory, any abusive leader, or destructive rebel, could claim that their mistreatment of others is really just a deeper expression of wrathful compassion. It could easily be used as a justification for why certain basic ethics don\u2019t apply to us. But it is, as far as I can tell, a very powerful both-and if done correctly: the unstoppable energy and agency of wrath, channeled towards universal purposes motivated by compassion.\nYet another, somewhat less dangerous, one is empirical pessimism combined with theoretical optimism: yes, it is true that civilizational collapse may occur sooner or later, and yes, we\u2019re all mediocre and likely to fail to change the ways of the world, and yes, things always go horribly awry sooner or later (pessimism, then, in the empirical sense: what will actually happen is often pretty bad: hence, \u201cempirical pessimism\u201d). But it is still true that whenever we find out something that brings us closer to truth, justice, and beauty, such qualities nevertheless manifest (so, in theory, the greater good is always there as a potential, and still worth striving for: \u201ctheoretical optimism\u201d). The two sides actually fit together: admitting that death, collapse, the ubiquity of mistakes, crash boom bang, are the rule, not the exception, takes nothing away from the sense that all things connect in the end, in a larger view, and are worth resolving with truth-seeking. So in the short run, the conservatives and cynics are always right: \u201cIt\u2019ll never work, guys. Get a job. And a damn haircut.\u201d But in the long run, at least some of the most radical among us always turn out to be right: democracy did emerge, as did human rights and gender equality before the law, and the social welfare state. The universe has literally evolved from dust to Shakespeare, why then should it stop now? It\u2019s a tragic and eternally broken world, but because there is such a thing as truth, the very same brokenness always holds the promise of something unimaginably wonderful emerging. The tragedy of the universe also holds within it the capacity for the good and the just, towards which the truth leads us. It\u2019s pretty close to Gandhi\u2019s old dictum: \u201cTruth is God\u201d. That\u2019s a God worth keeping and submitting to.\nThe Double Extremist Stance\nAll of these are fruitful, if not innocent and harmless, paradoxes for us to contemplate, to play with, and to experiment with. What is the sound of both ands clapping? What potentials are we keeping ourselves from by thinking that one extreme always excludes its apparent opposite? The balanced mind is not necessarily one of golden means, of averages and compromises; a stronger balance can be achieved by becoming not just an extremist, but a double extremist. The farther you go in one extreme, the more potential is actually opened up at the seemingly opposite end of the spectrum, resulting in a wider embrace of life and reality. For instance, we may attempt to be extremely secular, and extremely religious, both at once.\nLife is always-already an experiment, and thus it is actually irresponsible for us not to take seriously its vast possibilities and potentials. We have every right to try to transform society, and ourselves, even if it is admittedly always a dangerous business. Because the status quo is also dangerous, also insane. With this call to live by sincere irony, I thus invite you to take a stance of enlightened madness, of double extremism, and to help to turn our struggles into play.\nNot only does this stance fuel a sense of hope and humor during life\u2019s darker tunnels and its sub-mediocre patches of tragedy, but it powers our shared capacity to reimagine and reshape our lives, and ultimately the world. Even if (and when) we fail, that\u2019s a win for Protopia.\nHanzi Freinacht is a political philosopher, historian, and sociologist, author of \u2018The Listening Society\u2019, \u2018Nordic Ideology\u2019 and the upcoming books \u2018The 6 Hidden Patterns of History\u2019 and \u2018Outcompeting Capitalism\u2019.

There are countries beyond the UK and the USA that produce good music.\nI know, it\u2019s shocking. And you might need some time to comprehend this.\nRemarkably the press you read won\u2019t tell you about Ukrainian music. You\u2019ll be informed about wars, disasters, and conflicts happening in foreign countries but not about their culture and art. So pacifistic.\nThis is a shame as you\u2019re missing on something fairly gorgeous and alluring.\nSo my intention is to reclaim this nuisance. And I can humbly say \u2014 this is nothing less than an act of kindness from my side. An incredible gift that you shall not forget and cherish for the rest of your life.\nI\u2019m just kidding.\nBut, surely, discovering Ukrainian music can be a life-changing experience. It\u2019ll add more color and flavor to your life. You might indeed become a better person after listening to some fine specimen of this genre.\nSo, please, let me be your guide and help you to explore, perhaps, something new.\nBefore we dive into this indulgence, I shall make a few brief points or observations on why is Ukrainian music so indescribably amazing.\nThe Language, Instruments and Ethnic Tunes\nThe language definitely makes the Ukrainian music somewhat of the eighth wonder of the world. Yes, I know what you think. Slavic languages are an acquired taste (no insult is intended here). I can understand if you aren\u2019t very fond of them. Indeed, they might sound harsh on the first encounter.\nBut the Ukrainian language is an exception to this rule. It has more soft consonants than other members of the Proto-Slavic language group. This makes the sound of it actually mellow to a delicate ear and free of obvious roughness. And in some magical way, those slight variations in phonetics give the Ukrainian language incredible fruitiness. It almost feels like it was specifically designed for signing rather than speaking.\nAnd then \u2014 as a pleasant complement \u2014 you get folk tunes and traditional instruments that play a huge role in the making of a modern Ukrainian melody. You will notice the prominence of woodwind instruments, like Ukrainian sopilka or Armenian duduk, in the arrangements of many contemporary Ukrainian artists.\nThough used to this by now, hearing a new song with the sound of duduk still channels some grand emotions in me, making me feel like I reunite with my ancestral heritage.\nOkay, this sounds grossly pathetic.\nLet\u2019s just say that I find Ukrainian music refreshing. A good way to escape the world dominated by tropical and Latino sounds.\nAnd now it\u2019s time to do exactly that.\nThe Ultimate Playlist\n1. KAZKA\nA fun fact about the music industry in Ukraine is that many popular artists come from talent shows like The X-Factor and The Voice. Which is unlike in other countries where former contestants get lost in the cacophony of other voices.\nKAZKA is one of the bands that managed to become incredibly successful after taking part in the local franchise of The X-Factor. The lyric video for their song \u201c\u041f\u043b\u0430\u043a\u0430\u043b\u0430\u201d is the first one in the Ukrainian language to attract more than 50 million views on YouTube.\nThe sound of KAZKA must appeal to the audience beyond Ukraine as the band incorporates a lot of contemporary trends in their music. But despite this mainstreamness, KAZKA\u2019s identity remains to be recognizable via folk pastiche of their instrumental and vocal arrangements.\n(From Ukrainian \u2014 \u201cCrying\u201d)\nOther notable songs: C\u0432\u044f\u0442\u0430, \u0414\u0438\u0432\u0430, and \u0422\u0430\u043d\u0446i\n2. THE HARDKISS\nTHE HARDKISS is probably a personal favorite of mine. They create a truly unique material complemented with glamorous and robust aesthetics. It\u2019s hard to label them in terms of genre. I guess you can say they\u2019re a progressive rock band often inspired by ethnic music.\nThe lead vocalist, Julia Sanina, has, perhaps, one of the richest and clearest voices I have ever heard in my life. The song \u201c\u0416\u0443\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043bi\u201d is an interesting example of how Ukrainian artists manage to recycle traditional ethnic melodies into songs that sound current and fresh.\n(From Ukrainian \u2014 \u201cCranes\u201d)\nOther notable songs: \u041c\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0434i\u044f, \u0425\u0442\u043e, \u044f\u043a \u043d\u0435 \u0442\u0438, and \u041a\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043bi\n3. Jamala\nEuropean audience might know Jamala from her winning performance at the Eurovision Song Contest 2016. But for me, she is much more than that victory. Jamala is the embodiment of Ukrainian neo-soul and ethnic fusion. She has an extremely memorable sound with her vocals having a uniquely earthy quality.\nJamala\u2019s music imbibed traditions of many nations as her creative talent is a product of many ethnicities and cultures. \u201c\u0428\u043b\u044f\u0445 \u0414\u043e\u0434\u043e\u043c\u0443\u201d is a telling example of her artistic style. The rhythmic of house and RnB music are often used as a foundation for everything else here.\n(From Ukrainian \u2014 \u201cA way back home\u201d)\nOther notable songs: \u0417\u0430\u043f\u043b\u0443\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0430\u0441\u044c, \u0421\u0443\u043c\u0443\u044e, and \u041a\u0440\u0438\u043b\u0430\n4. Sergey Babkin\nSergey Babkin performs in a genre that I believe does not exist at all in the contemporary Western music. The closest example of a similar style in the popular music is, perhaps, Adele\u2019s song called \u201cMillion Years Ago\u201d from her latest album \u201c25\u201d. A good deal of instrumental asceticism is common for this genre as well as a focus on lyricism and rawness of vocal performance. The song \u201c\u041a\u0440\u0456\u0437\u044c \u0442\u0432\u043e\u0457 \u043e\u0447\u0456\u201d is a fortunate and unexpected experiment, very likely inspired by James Blake\u2019s languid and ambient oeuvre.\n(From Ukrainian \u2014 \u201cThrough your eyes\u201d)\nOther notable songs: \u041f\u0440\u043e\u0431\u0430\u0447, #\u0430\u043b\u0435, and \u0414\u0435 \u0411\u0438 \u042f\n5. ONUKA\nONUKA\u2019S music is the space where the experimentality and boldness of electronic sound meet the harmony and tranquillity of folk tradition. The band prominently and intentionally uses Ukrainian folk instruments to channel indigenous and primordial energy. The latest single \u201cStrum\u201d is ONUKA\u2019S best attempt to fuse tradition and progress into coherent and conclusive sound.\n(From Ukrainian \u2014 \u201cStream\u201d)\nOther notable songs: Vidlik, Misto, and Time\n6. Gurt [O]\nI was not sure about including this band as their sound is quite underground. But their tunes are so catchy and current it would be unfair to leave them behind. I actually think that \u201c\u041c\u0443\u0448\u0435\u0447\u043a\u0438\u201d is my go-to song on the list. The combination of words in the hook is absolutely brilliant. Well, the whole song feels like a hook, to be honest. A definite ear-worm.\n\nOther notable songs: \u041e\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0430 13.4, \u042f \u0425\u043e\u0447\u0443 7.10 and \u0414\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0435 12.5\n7. Okean Elzy\nI fell in love with Ukrainian music after hearing Okean Elzy for the first time. The raspy voice of the lead singer and heartfelt lyrics are the things that got me hooked. Okean Elzy\u2019s music is a true representation of Ukrainian people and their national character \u2014 brave, freedom-loving and heartwarming. The song \u201c\u041d\u0435 \u0442\u0432\u043e\u044f \u0432\u0438i\u043d\u0430\u201d is, definitely, a good illustration of that.\n(From Ukrainian \u2014 \u201cNot your war\u201d)\nOther notable songs: \u041e\u0431\u0456\u0439\u043c\u0438, \u0411\u0435\u0437 \u0431\u043e\u044e and \u0422\u0430\u043a\u0430 \u044f\u043a \u0442\u0438\n8. TINA KAROL\nMy guilty pleasure. Tina is a mesmerising singer with a rich technique, array of melisma and an ear-piercing whistle register. Her music is not always right there for me as it tends to get a bit too commercial. But she, nevertheless, does an excellent job, especially when she sings in the Ukrainian language. Her piano ballad \u201c\u041a\u043e\u0441\u043ci\u0447\u043di \u043f\u043e\u0447\u0443\u0442\u0442\u044f\u201d showcases her voice in its purest and rawest condition.\n(From Ukrainian \u2014 \u201cCosmic feelings\u201d)\nOther notable songs: \u0417\u0430\u043a\u0440\u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0442\u0432\u043e\u0457 \u043e\u0447\u0456, \u041e\u0439, \u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0441\u043e\u043d, and \u041f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0447\u0435\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0438\n9. ODYN V KANOE\nODYN V KANOE is an indie-pop band first and foremost notable for their beautiful lyricism. I rarely listen to music for the sake of meaningfulness. But finding something both pleasant to your ear and beneficial for your mind is not without its perks. The lyrics in \u201c\u0427\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043d\u201d are comprised of verses taken from the poem of the same name by Ivan Franko.\n(From Ukrainian \u2014 \u201cBoat\u201d)\nOther notable songs: \u041f\u043e\u043e\u0431\u0456\u0446\u044f\u0439 \u043c\u0435\u043d\u0456, \u0414\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e, and \u0406\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0438\n10. DAKHABRAKHA\nA friend of mine described DAKHABRAKHA\u2019s style as ethnic-chaos. I genuinely struggle to come up with something more precise than this. Their music, indeed, carries this instinctive and animalistic odor. It wouldn\u2019t be out of place as a soundtrack to something like Game of Thrones. \u201cMonakh\u201d is as experimental as you can get with folk music, combining styles of several ethnic groups at once.\n(From Ukrainian \u2014 \u201cMonk\u201d)\nOther notable songs: Vesna, \u0417\u0430\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043b\u0438 and Baby\n11. YUKO\nThe most experimental band in Ukraine, YUKO combines traditional folk vocals with progressive electronic sound. Their music serves a motley reimagination of rudimental chants sung by folk singers across the country. For the sake of inspiration, the lead singer went on many trips to small Ukrainian villages to find the keepers of old Ukrainian tradition and gather material for her oeuvre. YUKO\u2019s latest album \u201cDURA\u201d paints a story of a young girl going against societal expectations to freely express her identity and will.\n(From Ukrainian \u2014 \u201cFool\u201d)\nOther notable songs: Vesnianka, SORRY and Galyna Guliala\n12. alyona alyona\nalyona alyona is a hip-hop artist with an unusual packaging for both local and international music landscapes. She can drop a truly catchy tune and communicate a message with meaning and substance while neglecting the common-or-garden bawdry typical for this genre of music. This lady knows who she is and she knows how she looks, and this sober realization of one\u2019s own identity allows her to be ironic, honest and ultimately sensational.\n(From Ukrainian \u2014 \u201cOpen Up\u201d)\nOther notable songs: \u0417\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0448\u0430\u044e \u0441\u0432\u0456\u0439 \u0434\u0456\u043c, \u0413\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0438, and \u041f\u0443\u0448\u043a\u0430\nHonorable Mention \u2014 Alina Pash\nI must mention this beautiful creature. Alina Pash has a lot of potential for becoming an excellent artist with an original and zingy image. She has only released two songs but both of them are excellent. Alina is trying to marry hip-hop and folk genres, decorating her music with the Ukrainian street dialect. \u201cBitanga\u201d is, for sure, a robust anthem to free creativity and crossover fashion.\n(From Ukrainian \u2014 \u201cHooligan\u201d)\nThis is all I have for today.

I take it outside every day, and it sees how everything is getting animated, swelling with blossoms of life. The trees put on white veils; they\u2019re getting broader and smellier with every new spring day \u2014 is someone getting married? The streets are getting busier with people wearing springy outfits, and jeans aren\u2019t shorts yet, but they\u2019re getting shorter and thinner the closer we get to the summer. The cafes expand outside their soggy dwellings and into the pavements bathing under the sun. Do pavements even need sunscreen or is being made of concrete give you natural defence from skin cancer?\nWhen the world of nature is getting lively, your mind struggles to comprehend that many humans are getting robbed of lives at this very moment.\nThe human world continues to spread lifelessness in the east and south-east of Ukraine.\nWar is a badly-manufactured jigsaw puzzle with purposely-incompatible pieces \u2014 made to drive your mind crazy from the numerous failed attempts to assemble the complete picture.\nMy mind is putting together another mental puzzle: do I have a right to enjoy the spring when its green leaves are also covered in the red colour of fresh blood?\nI\u2019m still not sure about where do I stand on that.\nMy mental self is resisting going back to peaceful living; my physical self can\u2019t help but fall on the green grass of serenity \u2014 it\u2019s so tempting, so natural, so earned after living through such a long winter.\nKyiv doesn\u2019t help to resist such temptation.\nThe city feels and looks so not war-like anymore \u2014 only an odd soldier or two remind you of what\u2019s happening. Sirens are getting so rare you almost forget how they used to break into your auditory space with a piercing, fearful sound. Stone blocks and Chezch hedgehogs no longer block the traffic: some are gone, and some are lying on the sides of the streets.\nPeople are getting used to this new normal.\nI\u2019m getting used to it, too, but a tiny seed of doubt is also growing in my mind: what if it\u2019s a trap, a piece of peace and not the whole cake?\nYes, it is a piece of peace \u2014 how can it be another way?\nHalf of the Ukrainian cake is covered in peaceful sprinkles, but the figurines of soldiers and dead bodies are still standing or lying down on other pieces. No one can guarantee you that the bloody birthday boy won\u2019t come to brush away sprinkles from that piece of the cake where you live and put its crazy soldiers on it.\nAnnoying ambivalence.\nIt\u2019s not only the question of safety \u2014 it\u2019s also about human solidarity. People not that different from me are still going through something that no human being should experience in their lifetime. The only way I can be with them is mental \u2014 it\u2019s the only way I can show my indifference.\nYet, I don\u2019t get what the practical benefit of my, to be honest, synthetic empathy is? It\u2019s synthetic because I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to live under constant shelling and bombing\u2014 I can understand that very sketchy.\nDoes self-inflicting emotional pain to yourself in such circumstances is anything more than narcissistic masochism?\nSomething tells me it is naive to think that mere empathy can do something besides tickling your ego.\nWhen empathy fails, we can only count on actions.\nI\u2019m not great at volunteering, shooting people dead, or persuading TV zombies into not being zombies anymore. I can try doing some of those things, but the result would be mediocre. Nothing I do will have the same impact as my writing \u2014 that\u2019s the craft I know the best. That\u2019s why I\u2019m writing now, and in writing, I remind you that war doesn\u2019t end with the arrival of spring \u2014 if anything, it might get even bloodier and driven by even more madness.\nWait, why am I so pessimistic?\nThe end of spring could bring some good changes.\nI heard Putin is sick, maybe with a terminal disease?\nAs I said initially, my mind doesn\u2019t like seeing people die in spring. Most of us would understand my mind's sentiment. Spring is, indeed, a beautiful time to be alive, but dying in the kingdom of beauty isn\u2019t the worst fate for a king to bring upon himself.\nI\u2019m thinking \u2014 maybe this duality is not a puzzle at all?\nLife and death have always held hands, dancing together in a round dance. In the same way, spring and war can co-exist, maybe even complement each other. It\u2019s almost like spring gives some hope that life will defy death eventually \u2014 before, it was just impenetrable darkness.\nWe live in remarkable times when the most creative and the most destructive forces come to life simultaneously \u2014 that\u2019s why, these days, we can all witness and be part of such incredible contrasts.\nIt\u2019s psychotic to watch but is it that unnatural?\nMy mind is tired of trying to put this jigsaw puzzle together.

Those people will have to do the most challenging work \u2014 to make sense of Twitter.\nCurators can highlight voices that would, otherwise, be lost in the speedrunning feeds.\nCurators can identify trends and conversations that come from civil discussion and human interest instead of controversy, emotional manipulation and clickbait.\nCurators can make Twitter truly accessible, give a platform to diverse voices, promote critical discourse instead of giving voice to everyone \u201cindiscriminately\u201d, a.k.a racist, agist and ableist speech \u2014 that\u2019s how an algorithm works.\nSimply saying, curators can find a golden thread in a stack of brown faeces.\nModerate, Moderate, Moderate\n\nIf there\u2019s anything to be learnt from human history, it should be the idea that freedom is viable only in moderation. Humans want some order the same way they want some freedom \u2014 that\u2019s why our ideal condition is between free movement and organised direction.\nModeration is about that \u2014 it settles a framework where everyone moves freely but not in such a chaotic way as to bump into others and impede their movement.\nThe more social media platforms exist, the better people learn to manipulate them and use them in bad faith \u2014 manipulations will become more intricate and more ingenious. To believe that Twitter and people using it would self-moderate such a complex system or control harmful elements is naive, if not dangerous.\nThe future of social media will present us with more complicated, nuanced issues that would need moderation from both machines and humans. I\u2019ve no idea about the role of machine learning in this, but I\u2019ve got an intuitive belief that even machines will need some curation and guidance from us.\nWhatever AI future holds for us, setting rules and following them is at the heart of any functioning social order \u2014 Twitter should also embrace a framework of flexible rules, in moderation.\nSegment, Segment, Segment\n\nTwitter \u2014 the same way as Instagram, Facebook \u2014 is sooo not structured: it puts all the cheese in one dumpling. Although, yes, it has hashtags and trendy topics \u2014 is that enough? Not anymore; we need more segmentation, maybe even different sub-websites.\nWe need Twitter Politics, Twitter Music, Twitter Culture, Twitter Many Other Things Under Different Segmendtated Headings.\nPeople have different, limited needs, but Twitter wants your needs to be unlimited and open to input from everywhere. That\u2019s not great. The result of it is procrastination, directionless scrolling, and meaningless clicking. Twitter has to move from the mentality of the interest of one to the interests of many.\nSegmentation will let people organise into social groups based on their unique interests and use them as platforms for new collaborative projects and subject-specific discussions.\nSegmentation ensures concentration and reduces dispersal.\nTwitter has been at the pinnacle of free speech since the rise of social media. But, our societies are getting more complicated and diverse \u2014 places of digital social interactions have to follow.\nWe need to find new ways to promote speech that equally values the contribution of every individual; the speech that doesn\u2019t exalt one group over the other. That\u2019s where curation, moderation and segmentation come in handy.\nOn the surface, that seems to limit \u201cfreedom a la Musk\u201d, but the good news is it\u2019ll promote a different type of freedom \u2014 where everyone stands on an equal footing, and not just appear to be.", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 160, "created_time": 1651404446288, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Social Media", "Twitter", "Elon Musk", "Media", "Opinion"]}, {"author": "Tony Solovjov", "post_id": "5e3151482580", "user_id": "8a5da783d378", "title": "Fathers + Sons = Classic Generational Conflict", "content": "Fathers + Sons = Classic Generational Conflict\nDay 63: two months into the war, my parents frustrate me more than ever.\n\nTWO WEEKS AND EVERYTHING WILL BE DECIDED!!!\nI\u2019ve heard that a lot since the war began. Yet, two months later, no answers are being given, and questions are getting more numerous, complicated and divisive. I feel more frustrated than ever before, and on so many levels.\nWar moves like a snail: slowly, stubbornly and leaving a lousy trail behind.\nThe only part of my life that has become stronger and clearer is my relationship with my boyfriend. The rest is a bummer.\nFamily issues make me particularly frenzy. We\u2019re supposed to be loyal allies; instead, we became the most ferocious opponents.\nMy father had a birthday two days ago. My sister messaged me to ask if I had sent him a birthday wish. I said I didn\u2019t see any sense in that: we haven\u2019t spoken for two months because of his and mom\u2019s pro-Russian position. So why does him having a birthday should make me more inclined to reach out?\nI didn\u2019t feel any compassion coming from them when Russia invaded the country I live in and put my life at risk \u2014 even more than that, they\u2019d found numerous reasons to blame me. They won\u2019t condemn Russia, but they will find ways to make me feel guilty. That\u2019s their level of compassion, so why should I be kinder towards them?\nThat\u2019s what I thought, and I\u2019d told my sister \u2014 writing them will only reinforce their privilege to act so hatefully.\nMy sister thought otherwise: \u201cIt\u2019s a symbol, a sign you\u2019re ready to negotiate, you\u2019re open to talking it through\u201d. The olive branch.\nI said okay, let\u2019s do it for the sake of studying human psychology and psychopathology.\nI messaged my father my birthday wishes and asked him how they were doing.\nHe replied: \u201ceverything is going fine; life is made of little things.\u201d\nI\u2019m obviously happy they\u2019re fine, but his child lives in a country torn by a brutal, idiotic invasion, and that\u2019s what he says?\nNo follow up \u201chow are you\u201d, nothing. He didn\u2019t care about how my life was, how did I feel.\nI made a step forward; he made a step backwards \u2014 once again. At least that\u2019s honest; my father doesn\u2019t play love games the way my mom does: she usually tells me tons of bullshit and insults, and then she says that she loves me. Then, finally, she deletes our conversations because she gets ashamed of what she wrote to me and doesn\u2019t want any tangible evidence. Sometimes I take screenshots. Cute, isn\u2019t it?\nLife is made of little things \u2014 that\u2019s an exciting way to justify your ignorance and indifference. I won\u2019 think of big stuff \u2014 that\u2019s unpragmatic \u2014 I\u2019m a little man, and it means my life is too little to care about anything outside it.\nIn some parts, I understand him: my life is also made of little things.\nIt\u2019s made of little sirens every once in a while. Little news of rockets flying around and people dying in other parts of Ukraine. Little fears that a missile might ram my flat and kill me the same way it did kill three generations of women in Odesa. Little thoughts that I would never speak to my parents again because our mutual misunderstanding was too irresistible.\nBut by and large, I don\u2019t understand him at all.\nWhat happened to you? When did you become so callous?\nHow can you believe Russian lies that are told in a blatant, vulgar way?\nYou speak Russian, and you don\u2019t understand that all those propagandists are lying? It\u2019s written on their faces; it\u2019s heard in their words.\nYou don\u2019t see how everything they do is to cover their lies?\nThey\u2019ve foregone logic and opted for conspiracy theories, populism, screaming, yelling, and lying. They banned every output of independent information: all news websites run by independent journalists, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, only YouTube left. They forbid people to call war by its name, critique the army and the state, and say anything against their vision.\nIs that the mouthpiece of truth? Is that someone you believe more than your son who lives in Ukraine and can tell you information firsthand?\nI have so many questions, and I can\u2019t ask them in person because you and mom made a choice, and you don\u2019t want to hear me out. You chose Russian propaganda in exchange for your relationship with your son.\nMy parents used to say they\u2019d love me, always and unconditionally \u2014 that was before they knew who I was; that was when I pretended to be what they wanted me to be.\nComing out as gay showed me that every love story is a contractual relationship with vaguely defined terms \u2014 even that of a parent and a child, maybe even more than any other love story.\nBy moving to Ukraine four years ago to live with my boyfriend, I violated a binding contractual obligation \u2014 I chose love instead of my parents\u2019 serenity; I decided to be true to myself instead of living in constant fear and conformation.\nMy parents continue to live in the \u201cRussian World\u201d because it gives them permission to freeze the time, to roll the clock hands backwards \u2014 to the times when everything was decided for you, when the rulers of the world told you who you are, and you had no other choice but to believe them.\nToday, we don\u2019t have that privilege, and this is inconvenient.\nToday, you choose to believe the propaganda, to believe that Putin and his comrades don\u2019t kill people nor destroy Ukraine when all evidence shows otherwise: hundreds of testimonials from victims; photographs of ruined cities, killed people, destroyed homes; millions of refugees forced to leave their motherland and flee to Europe(yes, not Russia).\nDoes that choice free you from responsibility for supporting a murderous regime?\nI don\u2019t think so; we will be held accountable for our stances \u2014 we live in a world of unprecedented transparency, and you can no longer hide behind the strong shoulders of someone else.\nYou\u2019re not the victim of Russian propaganda: you\u2019re the victim of your choices, the victim of yourself.\nEveryone can see everything today \u2014 just open your eyes and embrace it.

I just know that it\u2019s dark and I wish I were still asleep. (I\u2019ve since adjusted and now just consider more time to dance in my apartment, but that\u2019s besides the point.)\nNot even a plague can make me forget how annoying daylight saving time generally is, though.\nFor most of the U.S., daylight saving time starts at 2 a.m. on the second Sunday of March and ends at the same time on the first Sunday of November. The Department of Transportation, which is in charge of daylight saving time, claims the practice helps save on energy, reduces crime, and thwarts traffic accidents. But as many of you know, the government likes to lie. I don\u2019t mean that in a Tucker Carlson kind of way, but you get it.\nFor starters, robbing season has nothing to do with darkness and everything to do with the gross income inequality exacerbated by the plague.\nI\u2019m with Secretary of Department of Transportation Pete Buttigieg on paternity leave, but if he really wants to signify change, he ought to voice his support to end this bullshit with the time already. None of the government\u2019s positions on why this is still a thing make any sense. For starters, robbing season has nothing to do with darkness and everything to do with the gross income inequality exacerbated by the plague. It is the fault of both Donald Trump and Joe Biden to not simply use this pandemic to put money in people\u2019s pockets consistently. Playing with the clock is not going to fix selfish, cruel, and evil policy.\nGive me more money and more daylight!\nAs for traffic accidents, a 2020 study published in the National Library of Medicine found a 6% increase in motor vehicle accidents following the daylight saving change. Some of that was attributed to sleep deprivation and circadian misalignment. I\u2019d also like to add respectfully, a lot of people can\u2019t fucking drive. I will admit it took me a smooth minute to figure parallel parking out, but in my defense, I\u2019m from the South. People are out here acting like they are confused by red, green, and yellow lights \u2014 especially in Los Angeles, my God. I don\u2019t have that problem and people will drive terribly no matter the time.\nSleep experts don\u2019t rally behind daylight saving time either.\n\u201cIn general, during standard time people are living according to sun time,\u201d explained Erik Herzog, Washington University Professor of Biology in Arts and Sciences, in an interview with Fox 2 in St. Louis. \u201cBut then when we switch to Daylight Saving Time, there\u2019s evidence to suggest people are more reliant on their alarm clocks to get up because the mornings are dark. And using the alarm clock means we\u2019re waking up unnaturally.\u201d\nDon\u2019t act like many of you reading this haven\u2019t taken a lil\u2019 longer to wake up and ignore anyone texting you \u201cgrand rising\u201d because it\u2019s still too damn dark outside.\nIn a 2020 position statement, the American Academy of Sleep Medicine said the U.S. should eliminate daylight saving time in favor of a year-round standard time. Some states like Arizona have already done so while nearly 20 have considered similar measures in recent years \u2014 a move that some have called \u201clock the clock.\u201d\nPersonally, I think Americans need to free themselves from political phrases with prison references, but I\u2019ll cosign whatever gets us to quit playing with the time.\nMost of these measures, however, notably require a literal act of Congress because under federal law, states are allowed to opt out of daylight saving time and remain on standard time, but are not allowed to remain on daylight saving time. Earlier this year, a bipartisan group of lawmakers in Congress once again proposed staying on daylight saving time year-round with the Sunshine Protection Act. Getting Congress to do anything worth a damn is so hard, but they should really try on this.\nAnd I suggest we follow their lead and stick to a time that doesn\u2019t have an entire coast wandering through the dark at 4:45 p.m for several months. I may no longer be on the East Coast, but I share the pain of its residents. That level of darkness so early is literally unhealthy. I hear this nonsense makes people money, but I want to spring forward and be done with this.\nEven if America is arguably an empire in decline, the powers that be can at least fix some of the stupid things we endure for no damn reason.

Wade next month, but Democrats are asleep at the wheel.\nReproductive rights activists protest as oral arguments in Dobbs v. Jackson Womens Health Organization case are held on Wednesday, December 1, 2021. The case considers the constitutionality of Mississippi\u2019s restrictive ban on abortion after 15 weeks. (Photo by Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images)\nWhen it seems all but inevitable that the Supreme Court will overturn one of its most consequential rulings in a matter of weeks, shouldn\u2019t the one political party that professes to be against that expected ruling start raising hell already?\nIn June, the Supreme Court is expected to rule on a case concerning Mississippi\u2019s 15-week abortion ban. Given the court\u2019s conservative majority, it is expected the decision will end up overturning, or at the very least, significantly gutting the national protections for abortion rights that have been in place for nearly 50 years. Such scenarios would result in abortion immediately becoming illegal in more than two dozen states.\nLeading up to the expected decision, Republicans in states like Oklahoma, Florida, Arizona, and Texas have passed bans on the procedure. And in states such as Missouri, they not only mirror legislation passed by Texas that outlaws nearly all abortions through the use of a citizen-enforced ban, but up the ante. Indeed, Missouri\u2019s Rep. Mary Elizabeth Coleman has proposed legislation that would not only allow citizens to sue anyone who performs an abortion for a Missouri resident, but anyone who helps or even tries to help a Missouri resident seek an abortion in or outside of the state.\nSuch a law has rightly been compared to the Fugutive Slave Act. Republicans there are also to targeting the distribution of abortion-inducing drugs and to declare the right to an abortion doesn\u2019t exist in Missouri\u2019s state constitution.\n\u201cNationally, everybody is looking to a post-Roe world,\u201d Arnold explained in a recent interview. \u201cIn Missouri, we\u2019re almost already there.\u201d\nWithout constitutional protection for abortion up to the point of fetal viability outside the womb, many women might soon find their fate tied to an individual district attorney if they seek an abortion. In my home state of Texas, there is a \u201ctrigger\u201d law that makes it a felony to \u201cknowingly perform, induce or attempt an abortion\u201d except to save the life of the pregnant person.\u201d\nThis is how a grand jury decided there was reason to charge 26-year-old Lizelle Herrera with murder for a \u201cself-induced abortion.\u201d Herrera was arrested on a $500,000 bond and booked into the Starr County Jail in spite of Texas\u2019 murder statute explicitly prohiting prosecution of a pregnant person in the \u201cdeath of an unborn child.\u201d However, days after the arrest, Starr County District Attorney Gocha Ramirez reportedly said he would be exercising \u201cprosecutorial discretion\u201d by dropping the charges.\n\u201cIn reviewing applicable Texas law, it is clear that Ms. Herrera cannot and should not be prosecuted for the allegation against her,\u201d he wrote in a press release.\nConsidering how many Republicans in elected office are presently using their power to create laws to punish marginalized communities, those for reproductive rights are rightfully fearful of how many women might face legal problems for no other reason than living in a district with the wrong DA.\nMeanwhile, according to a new study from the University of California, San Francisco, nearly half of OB-GYN medical students will not receive any abortion training if the U.S. Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade this summer.\nThis is a crisis being largely ignored by the only major political party that says it cares about women\u2019s right to choose.\nStates such as California, Connecticut, Colorado, Minnesota, and Illinois are weighing their options on how to become safe havens for women to terminate their pregnancies, but where is the national messaging from Democrats?\nPlanned Parenthood is not waiting for the Democrats as they have announced plans to launch a national $16 million TV, streaming and digital ad campaign.\nAccording to Politico, the campaign will run in states like Arizona, Georgia, Mississippi, Texas, Ohio and Florida and focus on reaching nonwhite and youth voters. Additionally, there will be websites in both English and Spanish helping educate the public on abortion access in different states, how to locate health centers along with resources on how to get politicallly invovled.\nI applaud Planned Parenthood for doing its job, but where is Democratic leadership?\n\u201cDefending Roe v. Wade is a five-alarm fire, and I\u2019m deeply concerned that millions of Americans\u2019 reproductive rights are at serious risk,\u201d Senator Elizabeth Warren said to Politico. \u201cDemocrats need to mobilize an effective response \u2014 and every voter should know that Roe is on the ballot in November.\u201d\nYes, and the mobilization should start from the head of the party.\n\u201cWe absolutely need [Biden\u2019s] voice now,\u201d Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul explained. \u201cI know he has a lot on his plate right now as leader of the free world. But certainly the voice of the president is important to this. A whole lot more people are going to listen to what Joe Biden says as opposed to Kwame Raoul.\u201d\nIf President Biden\u2019s staff can draft jokes for him to deliver at the White House Correspondents Dinner, they can also write remarks and/or speeches about how the Supreme Court is trying to strip women of their autonomy.\nThe anti-abortion movement has been mobilizing for decades for the outcome expected in the ruling for Dobbs v. Jackson\u2019s Women\u2019s Health Organization, but Democrats have yet to come up with messaging and organizing to properly pushback.\nDemocrats may find public polling supporting their side on abortion to be comforting now, but Republicans don\u2019t give a damn about public opinion. They\u2019re banning any mentions of Black history in addition to queer and trans people in spite of public opinion week after week. Many of these politicians appear to be ignoring the fact that without real effort from them, regression will win because people will be made to feel helpless.\nOn Sunday, the New York Times reported that early into his administration, Biden was warned that inflation and immigration could erode his support. Evidently, he didn\u2019t take such warnings seriously enough. In this case, Democrats have known for 50 years what the right has planned for Roe.\nThey\u2019re just about there, and as it stands now, the Democrats have no plan and no calls for action. The Democrats might deserve to lose for not mounting a real fight, but the women across America don\u2019t deserve to lose their reproductive rights as a result of their inaction. So many Americans have no idea what this Supreme Court has planned for the country.\nIt is time for the Democrats to wake up and start sharing the grim news and plans to fight back \u2014 even if Roe\u2019s fate might be sealed.", "comment_count": 56, "like_count": 1591, "created_time": 1651502921754, "comment": [{"user_id": "a72d87e1fc58", "comment_time": 1651502921754, "comment": "Americans Are Set to Lose the Right to Abortion.

I hope Elon buys Twitter because he\u2019ll make improvements to it and he is a good man, but I am going to be staying on TRUTH.\u201d\nThat would be TRUTH Social, launched by The Trump Media & Technology Group last month.\n\u201cWe\u2019re taking in millions of people, and what we\u2019re finding is that the response on TRUTH is much better than being on Twitter,\u201d Trump added. \u201cTwitter has bots and fake accounts, and we are doing everything we can.\u201d\n\u201cThe bottom line is, no, I am not going back to Twitter,\u201d he declared.\nTrump was permanently suspended from Twitter following the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol riot after the company deemed a number of his tweets connected to the violent protests as inflammatory and warned of \u201cthe risk of further incitement of violence.\u201d\nAlthough he left in quite a bit of a huff, Sweet Potato Saddam would now like us to believe that he\u2019s not thinking about Twitter at all. Let him tell it, Twitter \u201cbecame very boring because conservatives were thrown off or got off the platform when I left.\u201d\n\u201cIt became boring because there was no interaction,\u201d Trump explained. \u201cThe interaction on TRUTH has been amazing.\u201d\nDonald Trump, for all intents and purposes, is a lying ass bitch. That\u2019s not breaking news, but it always bears repeating. That man can\u2019t wait to go back on that platform because he likely knows how much of a wreck the one he\u2019s promoting is.\nBased on what I\u2019ve read about the new social media app, it sounds like every other Trump venture: a business with dubious sources of funding and strong chances of a sudden premature death. Already, the company has lost key staffers and is being investigated by regulators. With respect to bots, based on those that have used the service and reported back, they run amok across TRUTHSocial. No wonder it\u2019s already been branded a \u201cghosttown\u201d and \u201cdisaster.\u201d\nThat is not a platform a narcissist that likes to stay in the mix will stick to for long. Trump needs not only an audience, but the kind filled with the type of people he prefers to target. It continues to be lost on most of the people shaping the news that most Americans don\u2019t even bother with Twitter. External research from Pew released in 2021 suggests only 23% of US adults use Twitter at all. A majority of Americans say they use YouTube and Facebook, and for those under 30, they primarily use Instagram, Snapchat and TikTok.\nTechnically, if Trump truly wanted to terrorize the masses, he would start a YouTube channel and start dancing to his favorite racist tunes on TikTok. However, tacky as that carrot juice skinned man is, he is an elitist and wants to be around the media types, which means he\u2019s going to want to go back to Twitter.\nAs much as many of us worry about the fate of Twitter in Musk\u2019s hands \u2014 especially in the case of Twitter\u2019s Black employees based on Tesla\u2019s reported treatment of Black people \u2014 there is plenty of reason to worry that the modern history\u2019s luckiest racist will be coming back \u2014 no matter what he\u2019s telling Fox this week.\nMusk, who claims his hostile takeover bid of Twitter is rooted in his desire to further expand \u201cfreedom of speech\u201d on the platform, has been widely expected to reinstate Trump if allowed to buy the company. He\u2019s noticeably had Republicans in Congress championing his bid with that in mind.\nOn the announced takeover by Musk, Congressman Jim Jordan tweeted, \u201cFree speech is making a comeback.\n\u201cToday is an encouraging day for freedom of speech,\u201d tweeted Senator Marsha Blackburn. \u201cI am hopeful that Elon Musk will help rein in Big Tech\u2019s history of censoring users that have a different viewpoint.\u201d\nA man that looked the other way at sexual abuse and a woman too stupid for words known to garner headlines related to her racism would be two of the loudest cheerleaders in Congress.\nIn the case of Jordan, though, he pretty much helped bully this bid into success.\nLast week, Jordan was among a group of 18 House Republicans asking Twitter\u2019s board to preserve all records related to Musk\u2019s offer to buy the company.\nIn letters shared exclusively with CNBC, Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee asked Twitter Board Chairman Bret Taylor and other members of the board to preserve any messages from official or personal accounts, including through encryption software, that relate to Twitter\u2019s consideration of Musk\u2019s offer.\n\u201cAs Congress continues to examine Big Tech and how to best protect Americans\u2019 free speech rights, this letter serves as a formal request that you preserve all records and materials relating to Musk\u2019s offer to purchase Twitter, including Twitter\u2019s consideration and response to this offer, and Twitter\u2019s evaluation of its shareholder interests with respect to Musk\u2019s offer,\u201d said the letter, led by ranking member Jim Jordan, R-Ohio.\nThis move \u2014 not even a thinly veiled threat \u2014 undoubtedly set up the prospect of a potential congressional probe should the GOP win back the majority later this year. I\u2019m sure as Twitter goes private under Musk, should any potential problems arise, one imagines this GOP will stay favorable to Musk so long as their interests remain aligned. It was already likely that Trump might return as he increasingly looks likely to run for the presidency again in order to avoid prison and spite Ron DeSantis, but now it all feels inevitable.\nI understand that it won\u2019t be the end of the world. Whenever Trump does find his way back to Twitter, I\u2019ll do my best to ignore him as I always did. I encourage others to do the same.\nStill, it\u2019s frustrating to see all of this to be celebrated as a win for \u201cfreedom of speech\u201d and \u201cdemocracy.\u201d Much of Twitter\u2019s success is related to Black users providing high engagement. There are Black employees there that have made real efforts to make tech more inclusive, and their spaces, safer for users. Now someone known not to even want to look his Black employees in the face is in control not only has control of the company, but is being encouraged to welcome back the carnival barker ex-racist president itching for a political comeback.\n\u201cFreedom\u201d sounds so much better when you\u2019re white, rich, and used to buying your way to more power.", "comment_count": 1, "like_count": 210, "created_time": 1650927096796, "comment": [{"user_id": "a72d87e1fc58", "comment_time": 1650927096796, "comment": "How Much Longer Will We Enjoy a Trump-Free Twitter?"}, {"user_id": "d81d49fe2c36", "comment_time": 1651180806314, "comment": "Oh, yeah.

The ruling from the Donald Trump-appointed U.S. District Court Judge Kathryn Kimball Mizell immediately voided the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s national mask mandate for public transportation. From my understanding, prior to being confirmed as a federal judge by the Republican-controlled Senate under then President Trump following his defeat in the presidential election, Judge Mizelle was just an associate at a law firm who hadn\u2019t even tried a case \u2014 causing her to receive the rare distinction of being ranked \u201cnot qualified\u201d by the American Bar Association at the time of her nomination.\nNow we get to live with the consequences of her inexperience and audaciousness until her lifetime appointment expires.\nThe decision reportedly \u201ccaught the White House off guard,\u201d but based on remarks from the administration, don\u2019t expect much of a fight from them on this ruling.\n\u201cThis is obviously a disappointing decision,\u201d White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said at a Monday presser. \u201cThe CDC continues recommending wearing a mask in public transit.\u201d Psaki earns a lot of praise for her verbal jousts with that dimwitted correspondent from Fox \u201cNews\u201d that likes to troll her during Q&A time, but this is a glowing example of how in the midst of celebrated spectacles, she often doesn\u2019t use the might of her platform where it really counts.\nPsaki could have at least acknowledged that in spite of how tired many of us are of wearing masks, we are still in a pandemic. The BA.2 variant is responsible for the rise in COVID infections \u2014 which are nearly 40,000 per day, but likely higher given the increased access to home testing. Between 400 and 500 people continue to die from the virus every day \u2014 a decrease from previous highs but no less daunting a figure considering America is reaching nearly 1,000,000 official deaths.\nConservatives often complain of \u201cactivist judges\u201d but it\u2019s the Democrats who ought to be doing the most shouting about their ills.\nPlanes may provide proper ventilation, but most buses, trains, subways, and classrooms do not, hence the lingering need for masks. Without it, more people are likely to get sick and die. This all should have been reiterated to the American public even if there was a suspicion such remarks would fall on deaf ears.\nIn Psaki\u2019s slight defense, though, she\u2019s only taking cues from her boss.\nOn Tuesday, a reporter asked President Biden if people should continue to wear masks on planes. \u201cThat\u2019s up to them,\u201d Biden answered. Biden didn\u2019t offer an immediate answer to whether or not his administration intends to appeal the Florida judge\u2019s ruling, but later that day, there was a statement released that teased a possible appeal if the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention decided that extending the measure is necessary.\nThe Justice Department \u201ccontinues to believe that the order requiring masking in the transportation corridor is a valid exercise of the authority Congress has given C.D.C. to protect the public health,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThat is an important authority the department will continue to work to preserve.\u201d\nSo they want us to know that they believe they should have the power to issue these sorts of mandates for public health, but don\u2019t want to fight for the right at the present moment unless the already beleaguered C.D.C. pleads with them to do so. Well, it was only days ago that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention extended the mandate through May 3 so it doesn\u2019t take much to assume where their thinking is. However, the thinking of the general public and the various industries will likely stop the Biden administration from following through with an appeal unless soaring COVID-19 infection rates compel them to.\nWithin hours, multiple airlines dropped their mask mandate, and by the following morning of the ruling, the country\u2019s 10 largest carriers said they would drop enforcement of mask requirements. Across social media, travelers have posted selfies and videos highlighting the ongoing celebrations of the post-mandate era. I suppose it makes sense for some flight attendants to sing \u201cthrow your masks away\u201d in jubilee over the end of the mask mandate since they bear the burden of enforcing it, but considering major British airports have been warning passengers to expect delays for months due to staffing issues related to the virus, one wonders if that kind of tune will fall out of favor within a few short weeks.\nAfter all, less than half of Americans are boosted. Much like masking, vaccinations have been made into an \u201cindividual choice.\u201d I resent rallying behind individualism during a global pandemic, but I understand how inherently American such a mindset is.\nThat\u2019s what made masking a political issue here and only here. It\u2019s that level of entitlement that has caused far too many people to act a complete ass over its enforcement. None of these people that have whined about masking have embraced that it\u2019s for the greater good.\nI don\u2019t want to wear masks forever. In fact, I\u2019ve enjoyed wearing my masks less in recent weeks. At the same time, I have never complained about mask ordinances because not only do I understand and accept that they are to my benefit, more importantly, it serves a collective benefit.\nFor so many Americans, this shared burden has only been interpreted through the prism of me-me-me. Of all things that have frustrated and troubled me throughout this plague, it has been that kind of selfish thinking that has irked me most. That mindset has given way to a disastrous cycle.\nThe cycle won\u2019t end anytime soon now. Congratulations to those individualists who love this ruling so much.

One is that we\u2019re goody-goodies. The other is that we\u2019re dissolute.\nIf you read my essay on why I\u2019ve never tasted alcohol (and never will), you might assume I was a goody-goody. (For the record, I\u2019ve been married three times \u2014 one of them was to a woman I once hated \u2014 so don\u2019t nominate me for sainthood just yet.) Either way, I was awkward and uninteresting growing up. Still am, at times.\nMy sister was different. By age fourteen, she was already gorgeous: six feet tall, syrup-dark skin, hair like a runway model\u2019s, walnut eyes, dazzling smile, effortless laugh. She was popular, too, which was a mixed blessing. At parties, if a friend drank one beer, she drank two. If the friend smoked two joints, she smoked three. Later on, there was heroin. Cocaine. Oxycontin. Crystal meth.\nBeing a preacher\u2019s daughter \u201cdid and didn\u2019t bother me,\u201d she reflects. \u201cI did the things that I did, not caring at the time who it hurt. Dad was actually wonderful through everything. He never \u2018preached\u2019 to me. I hated being forced to go to church and I hated the times that he would say \u2018How can I lead a church if I can\u2019t even lead my own family?\u2019 But at the time I was trying to prove that I was different and that I was going to be my own person.\u201d\nWhat she did instead was get pregnant. The father was a kid named Ian, a drug user and dealer. Seeing that my sister was listless and nauseated all the time, my mother asked if she was pregnant. \u201cWhy would you ask that?\u201d my sister exploded. \u201cDo you think I\u2019m a slut?\u201d Meanwhile, she tried to force her own miscarriage. She slammed into door knobs and punched herself in the stomach. On a youth mission trip, she drank a capful of bleach. The truth finally came out one Sunday morning when, dressed for church, my sister stopped in front of the kitchen sink and began to throw up again and again, the bile splashing her sallow face.\n\u201cI never accepted it myself,\u201d my sister says. \u201cI thought it would go away, like a hangover.\u201d (I\u2019ll have to take her word for this.) She stayed home from church that day. Imagine our father\u2019s distraction in the pulpit! How did he read the scripture? Pray without stuttering? Keep from saying \u201cMoses and the Ark\u201d or putting Jacob in the belly of the fish? After church, he brought home a pregnancy test, and when the test was positive, abortion \u2014 that b\u00eate noire of Southern Baptists \u2014 became an option, for health reasons. Ian, the father, was a drug user, and my sister was on Zoloft. According to her doctor, the baby might have birth defects. Worse, my sister could die during the delivery.\nI was not living at home at this time, and my family is curiously uncommunicative about major health issues (I expect to find out when my first parent dies by reading the obituary online). So I didn\u2019t participate in the decision. My sister\u2019s abortion was done in a clinic 45 minutes away at a cost of $300. Cash.\nOur mother rode in the backseat with my sister, holding a cool rag to her head. Protesters surrounded the clinic. They waved signs covered in Bible verses and pictures of charred fetuses. The staff at the clinic was cold, indifferent. No one told my sister, \u201cThis is what to expect\u201d or \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Things will be fine.\u201d They referred to her by number. She wore her previous year\u2019s plain blue Easter dress and some black flip flops. A nurse took her to the surgery area, laid her on a table, and jammed in an IV, which, in her words, \u201cburned like hell.\u201d She woke standing up. The nurse reached under the gown, wiped her crotch, and showed her the bright red blood. After she sat on a chair and ate some crackers, she was allowed to leave.\nOnce she had recovered and was able to start going out again, our parents\u2019 orders were unambiguous: no Ian. She saw him anyway. One night, when her friend Nick snuck her to Ian\u2019s house, she arrived to find him on the floor, his father leaning over him. Ian was blue; he had OD\u2019d on heroin.\nMy sister tried to revive him. Nick was terror-stricken. At one point, my sister barked at him, \u201cIf you\u2019re a chicken shit, call the paramedics and get the fuck out of here!\u201d The paramedics arrived and gave Ian an adrenaline shot to the heart. My sister called our father from the hospital, asking him to come get her. \u201cI\u2019m here with Ian,\u201d she said. \u201cI found him dead.\u201d\nImagine you are the pastor of a church. Your daughter tells you she snuck out to see a guy, and now they are at the hospital. It is the latest brick in a wall of suffering. Remember the time you got a call from a friend of hers, who told you Ian had shown up at his house, high as a weather balloon, and forced her into somebody\u2019s truck? Remember what you said to Ian when you found them, hours later? As the little bastard opened his door and stepped out, silver-tongued, talking about some misunderstanding or whatnot, you told him, calm as a benediction, \u201cIf you ever go near my daughter again, I\u2019ll break your legs.\u201d\nYou drive to the hospital thinking, the little bastard is getting what he deserves. Not a charitable thought, but you are human. If he dies, though, it will ruin your daughter. You don\u2019t want that, so you take her to see him a few days later. Standing outside the hospital room, you say, \u201cGo on in there. You have five minutes. And keep the door open.\u201d\nIt is the best you can do. And it will be the reason she tells everybody for the rest of her life that you and her mother did the best you could raising her. You will treasure that up in your heart.\nAbortion is a topic that everyone thinks they have a fully formed opinion on \u2014 until it touches them. As an English teacher, I read student essays on abortion all the time. It is without a doubt my most popular topic, more written-about than gun control, gay rights, or Colin Kaepernick. Most of the essays are pro-life, and they damn with the same narrative: teens act irresponsibly; they get pregnant; they would rather party than be a mom, so they get an abortion, which is wrong; they should give up the child for adoption instead.\nI never challenge my students\u2019 politics, but I do correct their facts. When they say it is mostly teens who get abortions, I respond that the majority is actually women who already have children. When they blame Roe v. Wade for creating the desire for abortions, I tell them the procedure was common, and accepted, before the 1800s. When they cry that all you have to do if you don\u2019t want your baby is place it for adoption, I point out that foster care is the first stop, where 60% of children spend up to five years. Some of them never get out.\nAnd when they scoff at the idea that abortion can be safer for the mother than delivery, I tell them about my sister, who doesn\u2019t mind being an object lesson. She says the choice to abort was hers, and though some might imagine my father coercing the doctor \u2014 \u201dJust tell her she\u2019ll die if she doesn\u2019t\u201d \u2014 like a preacher from a Flannery O\u2019Connor story, I believe her. She feels neither pride nor shame at her decision, which illustrates its complexity.\nThe child, if it had survived, would be about 21 now. What would its future entail? Doctor? Lawyer? CEO? This is another argument my students use: by aborting a child, you may be destroying the person who grows up to cure cancer.\nOr, I want to answer, you may be aborting a future serial killer, in which case the abortion saves lives. I might say that next time, if I weren\u2019t such a goody-goody.", "comment_count": 19, "like_count": 4131, "created_time": 1528745655300, "comment": [{"user_id": "d0e1a210ee72", "comment_time": 1528745655300, "comment": "Thank you for sharing!"}, {"user_id": "27071e7ce64e", "comment_time": 1530279542236, "comment": "Funny, but your article is like a 3-point sermon on stereotypes surrounding faith and abortion; all leading to the \u201cgospel message\u201d that\u200a\u2014\u200awe can judge other people\u2019s choices, say all we want about what we would do in their position, and how we would make the *right* choice\u200a\u2014\u200abut when we are actually in that position the choices are a lot less black\u2026"}, {"user_id": "f590e00622d0", "comment_time": 1530264950746, "comment": "Very, very good read.

Unfettered Expression? How About Neither?", "content": "Censorship? Unfettered Expression? How About Neither?\nIt is okay that some ideas are never shared.\nPhoto by Brian Wangenheim on Unsplash\n\u201cWhen a class discussion goes poorly for me,\u201d writes University of Virginia senior Emma Camp in a recent New York Times article, \u201cI can tell.\u201d She relates the story of advancing a controversial opinion during a feminist theory class in her sophomore year. The idea didn\u2019t go over well.\nThe room felt tense. I saw people shift in their seats. Someone got angry, and then everyone seemed to get angry. After the professor tried to move the discussion along, I still felt uneasy. I became a little less likely to speak up again and a little less trusting of my own thoughts.\nAccording to Camp, this is an epidemic on college campuses. She cites a 2021 survey in which 80 percent of students self-censor at least some of the time. Forty-eight percent of undergraduates described themselves as \u201csomewhat uncomfortable\u201d or \u201cvery uncomfortable\u201d during classroom discussions. At Camp\u2019s own college, 57 percent of students feel that way.\nThis is a consequence of several trends. One is the increased sensitivity toward all genders, races, and levels of ability (what conservatives would deride as \u201cwokeness\u201d). Another is social media-based cancel culture. Still another is the efforts of some districts to eliminate certain books and topics from school curricula.\nCensorship is, of course, sickening. Everyone should be free to discuss their perspectives without the interference of people in power. However, that is not what happens in Camp\u2019s anecdote. What she describes is a situation that stand-up comics are all-too familiar with: saying something for which you expect laughs or hell yeses but hearing crickets in response.\nThat isn\u2019t censorship. It\u2019s the marketplace of ideas working exactly as it should.\nI teach writing to college freshmen. For one assignment, I have my students write about something they disagree with or that makes them mad. One student, Mary, wrote about being a white woman who has a Black boyfriend. The crux of the essay was a confrontation with Mary\u2019s Aunt Patty, a \u201cvery conservative and opinionated person,\u201d who told Mary that\nbeing in an interracial relationship creates problems within families and that the Bible says that we as Christians are to be \u201cequally yoked\u201d within a relationship.\nMy students often write on contentious topics: abortion, gun control, racism. I teach them, when they are crafting an argument, to \u201cplant a naysayer\u201d \u2014 i.e., acknowledge, and then rebut, opposing viewpoints. When my students use this tactic, they tend to include the same qualifier. They use it so often, it has become a clich\u00e9. Mary used it three times in her three-page essay:\n\u201cEveryone has a right to their opinion.\u201d\n\u201cEvery person has rights and can believe whatever they choose.\u201d\n\u201cAlthough my Aunt Patty can believe whatever she wants . . .\u201d\nAs I read each phrase, I wanted to scream. So, apparently, did Mary.\n\u201cI bit my tongue so hard I thought I was going to bite it in half.\u201d\n\u201cI have never been angrier in my life.\u201d\n\u201c[I]t makes me incredibly frustrated that my own family criticizes something that is not hurting anyone, and even more importantly, that makes me happy.\u201d\nWe live in an America where everyone thinks their notions are faultless. They\u2019ll fight you if you contradict them, but contradict them we do. Usually, the discord is silly, as there is a kernel of acceptability in most beliefs.\nExcept Aunt Patty\u2019s. Views like hers are tasteless. Irresponsible. Damaging. Not just wrong but wholly, heart-and-soul, what-the-hellishly wrong. Racism is only one type. There are others, muddying our collective consciousness like meltwater.\nWhy would Mary defend their existence? Why would anyone?\nGoogle \u201centitled to opinion,\u201d and you\u2019ll get over 300,000 hits. The phrase is the subject of essays from philosophers to radio hosts to mommy bloggers. Legendary newscaster David Brinkley played on the phrase with his 1997 book Everyone Is Entitled to My Opinion. The phrase has an Urban Dictionary entry. It has a Wikipedia page.\nYet I see it as a phatic expression, an empty phrase said reflexively to serve a social function, like \u201cHow are you?\u201d or \u201cLet\u2019s get together sometime.\u201d Logically, it cannot be true that all opinions are equally valid. Jamie Whyte says that \u201cinsisting that you are entitled to your opinion cannot possibly give you any proper advantage in a debate.\u201d Patrick Stokes sees a moral failure in the phrase:\nThe problem with \u201cI\u2019m entitled to my opinion\u201d is that, all too often, it\u2019s used to shelter beliefs that should have been abandoned. It becomes shorthand for \u201cI can say or think whatever I like.\u201d\nOf course, no can be stopped from thinking whatever they like. There is a difference between thought and speech. Between opinion and expression. Between prejudice (Aunt Patty\u2019s thoughts) and discrimination (Aunt Patty\u2019s speech). Mary, with her insistence that \u201ceveryone has a right to their opinion,\u201d seems to argue that Aunt Patty can think whatever she likes but does not need to say it. Saying it crosses a line. Not Whyte\u2019s abstract line of debate protocol but the actions-have-consequences one.\nA line whose crossing made Mary sick at heart and led to her blasting the old bat in front of a stranger \u2014 me \u2014 several months later.\nIn theory, the think-but-don\u2019t-say approach should work. We can only judge others by their actions, and if they don\u2019t act badly, their opinions will stay cloaked.\nTrouble is, people can\u2019t keep odious opinions to themselves.\nFor one thing, they no longer have to. The last few years have seen to that with Twitter hot takes, combative press conferences, U.S. Representatives heckling the president during the State of the Union Address, and nearly every utterance from Donald Trump.\nSecond, Americans prize free speech more highly than most Western societies. It\u2019s part of our Enlightenment roots. Even when a truth is monstrously painful, the worse sin for some of us (I\u2019m looking at you, Tucker Carlson) is having to keep mum about that truth.\nWe can have a free society while still observing reasonable limits on expression. Opinions like Aunt Patty\u2019s are what those limits are meant to exclude. They are like the One Ring, the Elder Wand, the Ark of the Covenant: too destructive to be wielded responsibly. No one has a valid claim, title, or guarantee to those beliefs.\nNo one, in short, is entitled to them.\nBack to the story of Emma Camp.\nIf there had been value in whatever idea she espoused in that University of Virginia classroom, someone would have taken her side. Despite the threat of cancel culture, someone would have come to her defense. Maybe two or three someones, maybe more. And then the type of class discussion she longer for might have occurred.\nHer complaint, in other words, is that she didn\u2019t get the benefit of the \u201ceveryone\u2019s entitled to their opinion\u201d fallacy.\nIt isn\u2019t a problem that this is the case. As we know from Aunt Patty plus far too many others, some ideas don\u2019t deserve to be stated. They aren\u2019t worthy of debate. The problem is when a person in power chooses the ideas that are worthy.\nWhen the masses decide, that\u2019s simply market forces, just as when Blockbuster went out of business or McDonald\u2019s Arch Deluxe failed.\nBottom line: censorship sucks. So does unfettered expression (a.k.a., anarchy).

These aren\u2019t your favorite authors, necessarily, but ones you think best represent the genre writer ethos (however you define that).\nOkay, I\u2019ll start. First up: Stephen King. America\u2019s bogeyman does it all\u2013novels, short stories, movie scripts, comic books. I admit he\u2019s my favorite. When I met him at George Mason University in 2011 and he signed a book for me, I felt like the kid in the 1979 Coke commercial being handed Mean Joe Greene\u2019s sweaty jersey.\nNext is James Patterson. Nearly 100 books bear his name, along with 20+ movie or TV adaptations, and he was the bestselling author of the last decade, according to Publisher\u2019s Weekly.\nJ.K. Rowling is number three. Say what you will about her tweets (vomitous), but any writer who out-earns Queen Elizabeth deserves to have her head chiseled somewhere.\nAnd number four? It\u2019s probably not someone you would guess, so I\u2019ll give you a minute.\nReady now? Here goes:\nMichael Crichton.\nCrichton may seem like a lightweight, having published only 34 books before his death in 2008. Yet those books have sold over 200 million copies. One of them was, of course, Jurassic Park, now the tenth highest-grossing media franchise ever (the sixth movie, Jurassic World Dominion, comes out in 2022). His television show ER lasted fifteen seasons, won 23 Emmys, grossed over $3 billion, and made stars of George Clooney, Noah Wylie, and Julianna Margulies. In its 1998 survey of the wealthiest entertainers, Forbes put Crichton at number seven.\nAnd he did all this without the notoriety of King, who was a drunk and a drug addict early in his career. Or Patterson, who oversees a group of acolytes who do the actual writing before he sticks his name on the cover. Or Rowling, the LGBT community\u2019s toxic girlfriend: they give her chances, and she plays stickball with their guts. Crichton did have three divorces, but if that\u2019s the worst we can say about him . . .\nOf course, it isn\u2019t. Spend some time online, and you\u2019ll find readers of his work complaining about the way Crichton treats his female characters. For example, in the novel Sphere, he introduces the zoologist Beth Halpern not by describing her work, her mind, or her personality but her legs, hair, and \u201clarge and liquid\u201d eyes. Later, the main character, Norman Johnson, watches Halpern sleep, delighted that \u201cthe harshness had gone out of her features.\u201d\nIn its 1998 survey of the wealthiest entertainers, Forbes put Crichton at number seven.\nDisclosure also makes modern readers wince. The story of a female exec who propositions a male underling, it \u201cexudes a noticeable whiff of male resentment,\u201d in the words of one critic, and \u201creflects deep anxieties over a culture . . . where women\u2019s power is rising and the norms of male behavior are changing,\u201d according to another. Generously, Crichton gave the novel\u2019s sleaziest line to a woman, Louise Fernandez: \u201cIt\u2019s terrible to say it . . . But in the real world? With no witnesses? Alone in the office with his boss? He probably should have shut up and fucked her.\u201d Nice.\nThen there\u2019s Jurassic Park.\nThe book is very different from the movie, more ecology treatise than Godzilla Takes Costa Rica. It includes three female characters. One is the blink-and-you\u2019ll-miss-her Dr. Bobbie Carter, who doesn\u2019t appear in the movie. The other two are Lex and Ellie, played in the film by Ariana Richards and Laura Dern, respectively.\nUnlike Movie Lex, Book Lex is younger than her brother Tim. She is whiny and demanding, and she has no skills. Remember when Movie Lex reboots the park\u2019s computer system, reactivating the door locks and saving everybody from becoming raptor repast? The same scene occurs in the book, but it\u2019s Tim who does the reboot. Plus, like his silver screen counterpart, he\u2019s still a dinosaur expert. (Lex, though, does get off one of the novel\u2019s sickest burns. When Grant suggests to Tim how a bunch of same-sex dinosaurs could breed \u2014 the familiar female-to-male switcheroo \u2014 she chimes in with, \u201cTimmy\u2019s very interested in sex.\u201d)\nBook Ellie is likewise unextraordinary. For starters, she isn\u2019t Grant\u2019s girlfriend but his grad student. She has no ideas or expertise, and her main role seems to be tending to Malcolm after his injury at the (undersized) hands of T-Rex. The biggest slight comes at the end of the novel. Rescuers fly in on helicopters, and they encounter Grant, Ellie, and the lawyer Gennaro.\nAn officer came toward Grant and shouted: \u201cSe\u00f1or, are you in charge?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Grant said. \u201cI\u2019m not in charge.\u201d\n\u201cWho is in charge, please?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\nThe officer went on to Gennaro, and asked the same question: \u201cAre you in charge?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Gennaro said.\nThe officer looked at Ellie, but said nothing to her.\nIn the words of Austin Powers, \u201cOuch, baby. Very ouch.\u201d\nThese aren\u2019t good looks for any writer, much less a celebrity one read by millions. The question is, how seriously should we take these passages? It is tricky to suss out a writer\u2019s personal views from their work, especially when that work is fiction.\nBut what if the fiction were stripped away? What if Crichton wrote to the world in his own voice about the issues surrounding women and men? We could certainly make some statements about his views then, couldn\u2019t we?\nIn fact, he did this very thing in a little-remembered series of essays for \u2014 where else? \u2014 Playboy.\nLet\u2019s start with \u201cMen\u2019s Hearts,\u201d which appeared in the February 1989 issue. The essay opens with Crichton describing an occasion when he stayed with a family in a village in Papua New Guinea. Polygamy is legal there, and Crichton\u2019s host, a man named Hebru, is preparing to marry his third wife. Hebru\u2019s second wife doesn\u2019t want that, and it leads to a fight. Crichton writes,\nSo there we are, standing outside in the morning sun, two guys kicking the dirt and commiserating over a traditional guys\u2019 problem. She isn\u2019t doing what she\u2019s supposed to do. She\u2019s mad for no reason. She\u2019s unreasonable. She\u2019s impossible. Women!\nThis sounds like a joke, a merry kick-off to an otherwise sober analysis of male-female dynamics. Maybe Crichton meant it to be. A few lines later, though, he drops the joshing and talks turkey:\nThere is no question that men feel under attack, and psychologically beaten down. All sorts of horrible qualities are attributed to us: we are unemotional, we are brutal, we are violent, we are uncaring. We\u2019re lousy lays. We don\u2019t know how to do it. We don\u2019t know how to find that clit. We don\u2019t know how to satisfy our mates.\nLest you think this is irony, or a set-up to some deeper insight, or just Crichton blowing off a little steam, he responds to some specific criticisms of men with male chauvinist whataboutism.\nWe don\u2019t discuss feelings? Yeah, but women are no better.\nWe don\u2019t listen? Well, this woman ignored me at a dinner party.\nWe can\u2019t commit? Honey, you should see a woman trying on clothes.\nIt is tricky to suss out a writer\u2019s personal views from their work, especially when that work is fiction.\nAnd Crichton makes other mistakes. Tone, for instance. I teach writing to college freshmen, and one story I tell them is of an essay I wrote that includes a scene with my then-wife, from whom I was separated. She asked me to watch her daughter at her place one night so she could \u201crun some errands.\u201d I agreed, against my better judgment, and when she finally called around midnight to say she was headed home, I could tell she had been drinking. This made me mad. The longer I sat there, waiting, the madder I got.\nWhen she finally got home, here is how I described the moment of her arrival: \u201cThe door opened, and the night spat her out.\u201d\nI shared this essay with some writer friends, and every one of them, every one, said the same thing: \u201cMan, Anthony, you really hate her, don\u2019t you?\u201d The thing is, I didn\u2019t. We had been divorced twenty years, and I rarely thought of her. I was simply looking for some creative phrasing. Yet, what did I expect readers to think, comparing an ex to sputum?\nCrichton, in his story of the woman who ignored him at a party, says she was a friend who talked to him some but mostly to other guests. For that offense, she earned the label \u201cconversational cocktease.\u201d\nIf only he had workshopped with my writing group.\nAnother thing I teach my students is to identify their sources, even when they don\u2019t have to.\nIn any kind of argument essay, writers should support their arguments with facts. Those facts come from somewhere. I don\u2019t always require formal MLA citation, but that doesn\u2019t relieve students of mentioning in the text where their facts come from. Why? Such disclosure boosts a writer\u2019s credibility.\nIn discussing why women are equally inept at discussing their feelings as men, Crichton tosses this out: \u201cmost child abuse occurs in single-parent families headed by women.\u201d\nWhere did he find that rhetorical flash-bang? And even if it were true, what does it have to do with conversation skills? Does anyone think elocution lessons would keep a parent from beating a child?\nA little later, Crichton settles into his thesis: that stereotypes are useless. Worse, they are ruinous. They keep us from understanding one another, from empathizing with one another. In short, they keep us from intimacy. It\u2019s a wonderful message, and I agree with it in spades. Remember, though, how tone can work against us. A man who would call a woman a \u201cconversational cocktease\u201d is asking to be undermined.\n\u201cMen\u2019s Hearts\u201d wasn\u2019t Crichton\u2019s maiden voyage for Playboy. He wrote another essay the year before about dating in the age of AIDS. It begins like this:\nThere\u2019s a time in a man\u2019s life when he only wants to get laid and he doesn\u2019t care about love at all, and if he says he does, he\u2019s lying, because in truth he\u2019s always on the prowl. He can profess undying love to a woman as he crawls out of her bed, and by the time he gets to his car and puts his key in the ignition, he\u2019s already thinking of someone new. It\u2019s nothing personal, it\u2019s just the effect of raging hormones.\nThis has a stand-up comedy quality, a guys-know-what-I-mean heartiness that we laugh at without interrogating much.\nExcept Crichton wasn\u2019t trying to be glib. Published in 1988, this essay was controversial for hinting that AIDS was a gay thing. He called the disease \u201ca tragic affiliation for certain groups\u201d and called the risk of heterosexual transmission \u201cpretty small.\u201d On the subject of whether Crichton himself was worried about catching AIDS, he said, \u201cI\u2019m not homosexual and I don\u2019t inject drugs and I don\u2019t have intimate friends who do. So no, I\u2019m not worried.\u201d\nEventually, he gets around to discussing AIDS seriously, calling it a \u201cplague\u201d that threatens society as a whole. He writes with conviction. \u201cThis is not the time,\u201d he thunders, \u201cto misunderstand issues of life and death by casting them in the 60\u2019s mold of civil rights, or in the 70\u2019s mold of sexual freedom.\u201d\nSeems sensible enough. If only he hadn\u2019t prefaced it with this patronizing exchange:\n\u201cYou really think the risk of AIDS is overstated?\u201d she asks, resting her hand on my arm.\n\u201cI really do.\u201d I look into her eyes.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d she says. And she squeezes my arm.\nPlayboy was Crichton\u2019s safe space, where he could let it all hang out. This was apparent by 1991, when he wrote in the conclusion of his men-vs-women trilogy:\nJust so we\u2019re clear, the purpose of this article is not to teach you to get along with a woman. That\u2019s a life\u2019s work. The purpose of this article is to teach you how to win a domestic fight. To win quickly, cleanly, and bloodlessly \u2014 but above all, to win. Got it?\nIf Crichton wrote those words today, he\u2019d be called an incel, kicked off Twitter, and added to the Shitty Media Men List.\nLook, writing is performative. All writing, even journalism. It has to be, to entice readers. Essayists don\u2019t have plots and characters to draw people in, so they rely on what they do have: their personas. Like shock jocks or comedians, they professionalize their own sensibilities by presenting them entertainingly.\nThe catch is that, while exaggerated, these sensibilities are not made up. They contain the truth of legends, which is not nothing. It may not be fair to ask the novelist, who does make things up, \u201cIs this what you think?\u201d Intentional fallacy, and all that.\nBut it is fair to ask the essayist. Michael Crichton seldom published nonfiction, and perhaps this is why: he let too much of himself shine through.\nThere aren\u2019t a lot of critical studies of Crichton\u2019s fiction. I couldn\u2019t find any book-length studies. As for articles, most are about Crichton\u2019s movies rather than his books, and the ones that touch on the novels have thesis statements like this one from the journal On_Culture:\n[Jurassic Park is] a fictional thought experiment which not only simulates an emergency situation, but also explores the reasons for the collapsing of the control system in the fictional theme park from the vantage of chaos theory.\nHoo boy.\nFor traditional literary analyses of Crichton\u2019s work, we\u2019re left with blogs, Twitter, and Reddit (my favorite thread: \u201cHas Michael Crichton ever even met a woman?\u201d). A lot of the discussion seems to revolve around whether Crichton was sexist or misogynist. This is like asking whether Donald Trump is a sociopath or merely a narcissist: one is worse, but both are bad.\nYou could probably level the \u201csexist\u201d charge at just about any male writer, but many wouldn\u2019t stick. The accuser would be an outlier and ridiculed for it. Crichton has many accusers, and while they disagree on the number and severity of his offenses, no one says about him, \u201cOh c\u2019mon. You guys are just making stuff up.\u201d In other words, it seems there is a there there.\nEssayists don\u2019t have plots and characters to draw people in, so they rely on what they do have: their personas.\nSeeing what we\u2019ve now seen about Crichton the Man vs. Crichton the Writer, the question arises: should we still read him?\nI\u2019m not a believer in censorship. Conservatives censor things when they\u2019re afraid of progressive content. Liberals do it to force progress, even when the better play would be to let it occur naturally. Either way, it is a disservice to the marketplace of ideas. Besides, what\u2019s the one guaranteed way to get more people to buy what somebody is selling? Tell them they can\u2019t. This is why, after a Tennessee school district banned the graphic novel Maus recently, it became Amazon\u2019s number 1 bestseller.\nSo I don\u2019t agree with cutting off access to a writer\u2019s work based on their offensive views. What I do agree with is incorporating those views into our criticism of that writer\u2019s work. Not every novel is autobiographical, but a writer\u2019s views do shape their work, even the fiction. Thus, it is perfectly appropriate to call out retrograde ideas when those ideas appear in the work.\nCrichton\u2019s misogyny, or sexism, or whatever you want to call it is definitely present.

All are bestselling authors. Award-winning authors. Authors who are written about and studied and among the finest authors working today.\nAnd all have, at one time or another, self-published their work.\nGrisham printed copies of his first novel, A Time to Kill, and sold them out of his car trunk. Atwood also printed copies of her first book, Double Persephone, with a flatbed press. She designed the cover using linoblocks. Andy Weir published The Martian in installments on his blog. At the urging of some readers, he compiled the chapters into an e-book, which he sold on Amazon for 99 cents. Then Crown Publishing came knocking, followed by 20th Century Fox. Stephen King owns the literary establishment, so he might as well own his own publisher, Philtrum Press, which has produced a number of handsome limited editions over the years. It is the only press ever to print portions of his as-yet-unfinished novel The Plant (you can download these portions from King\u2019s website).\nImagine these industry titans in the year 2021 as struggling young writers who can\u2019t get anyone to look at their work. They decide to self-publish. Amazon, iUniverse, BookBaby, LuLu, Barnes and Noble \u2014 there are many choices of platform.\nWhen the books are ready, they want to promote them on Instagram or Twitter or their own blogs. What would be a good way to do that? Reviews. So they pay Kirkus or IndieReader or Blue Ink, which sends the books to some of its freelancers to bang out the reviews.\nFreelancers like me.\nIt\u2019s often said that a good way for beginning writers to build up some publication credits is to write book reviews. Of course, you don\u2019t start with gigs at the top \u2014 the New York Review of Books or the Times Literary Supplement. You have to work your way up. I\u2019ve written reviews for literary magazines as well as trade publications like CHOICE and Library Journal, both of which librarians use to select materials for their libraries. (I wasn\u2019t paid for these reviews, but I did get to keep the books.)\nLike most journalism, book reviews are both proliferating and an endangered species. Newspaper book sections have mostly vanished, yet the Internet is awash in book commentary. Or, as Jennifer Howard puts it in the Los Angeles Review of Books: \u201cIt\u2019s a #bookstagram as well as an NYTBR world now.\u201d\nAmy Edelman knows this as well as anyone. A New Jersey native with a background in public relations and three books on her resume, she is the founder of IndieReader, which provides a suite of services to self-published authors.\nNo longer the laughingstock of the literary world, self-publishing is a legitimate path forward for a writer. Edelman\u2019s favorite example of this is Lisa Genova, the neuroscientist who in 2007 self-published her novel Still Alice, about a Harvard professor with Alzheimer\u2019s. A couple of years later, it was acquired by Simon & Schuster. Over 2.5 million copies are now in print, and the book has won awards and been translated into 37 languages. Julianne Moore won an Oscar for her starring role in the film version.\nIt\u2019s a #bookstagram as well as an NYTBR world now.\nGenova\u2019s success made all the self-published authors out there ask: who\u2019s next? Seeing the opportunity in this question, Edelman created IndieReader. Initially, the site was consumer-facing, with how-to articles about the process. Lots of other sites, however, had similar content, so she narrowed her focus to reviews of self-published books.\nIt\u2019s a lucrative business. Authors pay Edelman $275 for a basic 350-word review, with higher fees for, say, a rush review (4\u20136 weeks instead of the regular 7\u20139) or a book of more than 100,000 words. This is about half the price of her competitors. Edelman then assigns the book to one of her 40\u201350 freelancers, paying them $40\u201345 per review. I\u2019ve written dozens of reviews for her since 2019.\nIf you\u2019re interested in reviewing self-published books \u2014 and why wouldn\u2019t you? It\u2019s fun! \u2014 here is my advice for doing it well.\nBe critical\nLet\u2019s get this out of the way: I don\u2019t mean critical like Goodreads, whose \u201creviewers\u201d are actually soul-sucking ghouls who wouldn\u2019t have a nice thing to say about moksha.\nNo, to be critical is to explain what works and what doesn\u2019t in a piece of writing. Criticism should neither eschew praise nor rely on it exclusively. Christian Lorentzen acknowledges the difficulty of this when he writes that a reviewer\u2019s imperatives \u201care to be stylish, to be thorough, to be funny, to be generous, and occasionally to be cruel.\u201d\nEdelman\u2019s approach is more simply stated: tough but fair. She wants her reviewers to avoid being mean while also understanding that she is providing a service to consumers who want to know which books are worth a read and which aren\u2019t. She takes that responsibility seriously. \u201cAs a writer myself,\u201d she told me, \u201cif I write something that gets a bad review, I just have to suck it up.\u201d\nMany writers can do this, though of course there are a few who would argue with God. Check out this rant by a guy who didn\u2019t like his treatment from Blue Ink. He wrote a 5,700-word rebuttal. Of a 300-word review.\n(Imagine if the critique had been book-length. We\u2019d have to measure his response in miles, not words.)\nBe specific\nEvery semester, I have my writing students produce a book review. I tell them to pick a book on any topic. Fiction, nonfiction \u2014 it doesn\u2019t matter. The only requirement is that the book be at least 100 pages. (I created that rule after a student did his review on Dr. Seuss\u2019s The Sneetches and Other Stories.)\nThey never really get this assignment, treating it like a literary paper in which they discuss the themes of the book. Or what a certain thing symbolizes. Or which character is the most like Jesus Christ. I want them to say, \u201cThis book sucks. Here\u2019s why.\u201d Or, \u201cThis book is great! Let me tell you about it.\u201d\nSelf-published authors are a lot like students. Some can write; others can\u2019t. The balanced feedback I mentioned earlier helps these writers because of what Edelman calls self-publishing\u2019s big advantage: a writer can remove the book from Amazon, incorporate the feedback, and republish. It\u2019s like replacing a rough draft with the final paper.\nIndieReader rates books on a scale of 1 to 5, and in my years of reviewing for the site, I\u2019ve given one or two 5s, just as, in my decade-plus of teaching, I\u2019ve read one or two essays that earned a 100. It is my job, when giving a score, to explain why specifically. Writers, student or otherwise, deserve that much.\nSome of the best feedback I ever got came not from a writing teacher but a U.S. history one. Her critique of one of my papers opened with these words: \u201cMore meat, less gravy.\u201d A zinger, perhaps. But also spot-on, which she demonstrated by pointing to examples of my sesquipedalianism.\nI see her words in my mind every time I sit down to write.\nBe entertaining\nThink of the humble advice column. It is a bit of an odd duck, both private and not, offered to a specific person for a specific need. And yet, because few situations are unique, others benefit from reading it.\nI indulge in several columns a day, savoring the questions as I imagine making my own response. Sometimes I don\u2019t imagine it \u2014 I do it, whispering my thoughts in my office or a restaurant or wherever I\u2019m reading. I am only a little embarrassed by this.\nIt is my job, when giving a score, to explain why specifically. Writers, student or otherwise, deserve that much.\n\u201cAdvice columnists,\u201d writes Jessica Weisberg in The New Yorker, \u201care not therapists or pastors. They are performers.\u201d A good book reviewer is the same.\nHere\u2019s a confession: sometimes, when I try to be entertaining, I come across as merciless. This is bad not only because I don\u2019t want to hurt the author\u2019s feelings but because too many zingers will undermine me as a critic. After all, I need readers, too. I won\u2019t get them by looking like a jerk.\nWhen one of Edelman\u2019s reviewers gives a book 2.5 stars or less, she sends the review to the book\u2019s author, giving that author a chance to kill the review. Generally, she doesn\u2019t refund the review fee, though I know of one instance where she did.\nIt was one of my mine. I gave the book one star.\nThe book was called Sons of God. Religion is a wellspring of self-published books, maybe because there are so many wackadoodle beliefs that can\u2019t find a traditional publisher. The book started okay, with a seemingly grounded thesis and some interesting imagery. But then it . . . well, here\u2019s what I said.\nThe first chink in the armor appears a few sentences later, when [the author] reveals that \u201cwhat we call history\u201d is \u201cat this very moment in time approaching the completion of God\u2019s secret plan as spoken of in the Book of Revelation.\u201d Hoo boy. What follows is over 400 pages of \u2014 there is no other word for it \u2014 rants on the end of days, the three \u201cwoes\u201d (the coming of the Lord\u2019s army; the unveiling of God\u2019s mysteries; and the second coming of Christ), and the need to \u201cget symbiotic with God.\u201d (Interesting word, as symbiosis includes parasitism, which is not a Sunday school-friendly image.)\nI ended with \u201cIf you\u2019re looking for a nuanced discussion of Christian themes, look someplace other than this rambling, fear-mongering tome.\u201d\nHoo boy, indeed.\nWhen I ask Edelman what surprises her most about self-publishing, she says it\u2019s \u201cthat so many of the books are actually pretty good.\u201d Sons of God notwithstanding, I agree. I\u2019ve reviewed self-help books. Children\u2019s books. Science books. Urban poetry. British mystery novels. I would never have picked these up but for the task \u2014 the gift \u2014 of reviewing them.\nHave any authors capitalized on their advantage by incorporating my feedback into their book? I have no way of knowing. No one has ever contacted Edelman to say they did this. Or, if they did, she never passed it on to me.\nI have to think at least some did. You can\u2019t be a writer without being a rewriter. Lisa Genova knows this. And Andy Weir. John Grisham. Heck, even Stephen King, who didn\u2019t let a career\u2019s worth of bad reviews \u2014 despite his longevity, the nasty ones still hurt \u2014 stop him from helping a local newspaper keep its book department open.\nWriting takes courage, and sending it out to the world in any form is Avengers-level heroism.

Last year, the sales of digital land topped $500 million on the fourth biggest platforms, and there were multiple million-dollar digital real estate deals in, for example, Decentraland, Axie Infinity, or The Sandbox. With $85 million in sales in January this year, we can expect 2022 to be a record year for digital real estate.\nWith an infinite supply of digital land across an increasing number of virtual worlds, you would expect low prices, but that is not what is happening. Prices are at an all-time high, and the more the metaverse is in the news, the more this will probably continue.\nIn addition, digital real estate brokers are jumping on the bandwagon as there is an opportunity because plenty of people have no idea how to purchase digital real estate but still fear missing out. Whether that is a good thing remains to be seen. There will also likely be a few scams here and there where people pretend to be brokers but then disappear with the money or with the land. When it comes to digital real estate, we are amidst a gold rush.\nDigital Real Estate and NFTs\nWhen buying virtual real estate, you are really purchasing a non-fungible token (NFT), which proves the ownership of that piece of digital land. According to Jason Cassidy, founder of the Metaverse Group and the company that bought a piece of land in Decentraland for 618,000 MANA (roughly $3.2 million at the time of purchase), buying digital real estate is like buying real estate in Manhattan in the 1900s. Except that it won\u2019t take 120 years for it to explode in value, but merely 5\u201310 years.\nMany people are very bullish when it comes to digital real estate and its importance. While some argue that digital real estate is all about location, location, location, similar to in the real world and that you want to be in an area with a lot of foot traffic, celebrity neighbors, and a prestige area that raises the value of your virtual real estate, I hold a contrarian view.\nA Contrarian View on Digital Real Estate\nThe current trend is that digital real estate moguls and brands are snapping up digital land for millions of US dollars across the various virtual worlds, either to rent it out to others, to exploit commercial activities on top of it, or to build a virtual shop or head office to connect with (future) consumers.\nAlthough this might be a good idea at this moment, and brands that want to step into the metaverse should purchase small amounts of land across a variety of virtual worlds to become familiar with the metaverse, it also comes with its challenges. As the founder of Second Life, Philip Rosedale said in a tweet in 2021: \u201cWhen virtual land is owned outright (on blockchain), malicious owners will extort each other by putting offensive content on small highly-priced plots in popular spaces.\u201d\n\nRosedale saw this happening 20 years ago in Second Life, and if it happened then, it will likely happen this time again. So, you have just spent $2\u20133 million on a plot of land in Decentraland, and before you know it, someone could buy a small piece of land close by and put up a massive billboard displaying something offending. Since it is decentralized, there is nothing that you can do about it. This would certainly give you a bad night\u2019s sleep.\nArtificial Digital Scarcity in a World of Abundance\nMore importantly, the concept of artificial scarcity when it comes to digital real estate does not make sense to me. Why do you have to do deal with neighbors in the first place?\nWhile land can be useful in virtual worlds to prevent spam or low-quality content, this can also be achieved in an infinite digital world by staking tokens instead of purchasing artificially scarce land in a grid-lock pattern.\nDigital real estate is a made-up construct. Of course, there is nothing wrong with that; we have all kinds of made-up constructs in society that work very well. For example, money is an artificial construct that had a rather positive impact on humanity (or a very negative impact, as some would argue). However, in the metaverse, you are not bound by physical limitations. There is unlimited space, and if you need to go somewhere, you can simply teleport to it. Why would you want a finite piece of land in an infinite space?\nThe grid layout and scarcity in these virtual worlds are artificial. I might understand it as a fund-raising activity for new platforms, which sounds eerily familiar to the ICO boom and dust in 2017/2018, but there is no other reason why you would want to limit yourself in an infinite digital universe where you can just teleport from one experience to another, never having to deal with any bad neighbour.\nOut-dated Virtual Worlds\nA problem with digital real estate being sold for (a lot of) money is that it is quite common for players to be done with a game and move over to the latest shiny virtual world. Soon, the once-thriving virtual world becomes deserted, removing all the fun because the virtual real estate is no longer maintained.\nThe same happened in Second Life, where the earlier users who bought virtual land left, didn\u2019t maintain their digital property and new users had to buy on the outskirts, far away from where the action happened. As Robert Rice, an early AR/VR pioneer and entrepreneur, shared with me, the better option would be to lease out virtual land by requiring interested parties to stake their crypto, which is automatically returned at the end of the lease period if they decide not to renew it. This way, the owner gets his money back while the land becomes available again to new users to build something nice on top of it and maintain a thriving virtual economy.\nMoreover, the platforms of today will not be the platforms of tomorrow. The next version, more advanced, with better features and capabilities, is undoubtedly already being developed, so unless Decentraland, or any other platform for that matter, is able to continuously reinvent itself, which is not only a technical challenge but for decentralized platforms also a community challenge to make sure a majority is aligned, a million-dollar investment could be losing its value quickly.\nFinal Thoughts\nDespite my contrarian view on digital real estate, I am sure that FOMO will continue to drive up the prices for digital real estate. Until prices will come crashing down because there will be so much supply of digital real estate that it will outstrip demand (which is not unlikely seeing how many virtual worlds are under construction, all trying to capitalize on the boom in digital real estate) or because people will start to see that buying digital real estate for millions of dollars simply does not make sense.\nThis article is part of my research for my fourth book, available for pre-order now: Step into the Metaverse: How the Immersive Internet Will Unlock a Trillion-Dollar Social Economy.", "comment_count": 11, "like_count": 97, "created_time": 1646408970575, "comment": [{"user_id": "46caac0e76b", "comment_time": 1646408970575, "comment": "Thank you for sharing!"}, {"user_id": "cea404ca44d9", "comment_time": 1646836450350, "comment": "One big EMP and it's all gone."}, {"user_id": "46143b2857b6", "comment_time": 1647134686146, "comment": "Your assertion can only be half correct, at most."}, {"user_id": "3c2e86203411", "comment_time": 1647257501912, "comment": "Excellent article"}, {"user_id": "3f2f432749ba", "comment_time": 1647220653953, "comment": "Why do you want to deal with neghbours? \n\nBecause that is where everyone goes too."}], "post_tag": ["Digital Real Estate", "Metaverse", "Nfts", "Blockchain", "Digital"]}, {"author": "Dr Mark van Rijmenam", "post_id": "12685bc424c", "user_id": "46caac0e76b", "title": "How Global Law Enforcement Can Benefit From the Metaverse", "content": "How Global Law Enforcement Can Benefit From the Metaverse\n\nWhile the pandemic brought fear, anger, despair, and grief to the world, it also drastically changed how we work. As soon as lockdowns happened worldwide, entire industries switched to remote collaboration without too much trouble, keeping the global economy afloat after the initial shock was over.\nFor many, working from home became the new normal. Meetings and events moved from the physical world into the digital world. Suddenly, employees had to be onboarded via Zoom or Teams, investments had to be made without ever seeing founders in person, and Annual General Meetings moved to the digital realm. While for many millennials and baby boomers, this was a brand new experience, it had been common practice for Gen Z and Gen Alpha. For years, these generations have grown up in the digital world. They have been socialising, interacting, trading, playing, partying, flirting, working, experimenting, presenting and collaborating in closed virtual worlds such as Roblox, Minecraft or Fortnite. In the coming years, these generations are hitting the workforce, especially Gen Z, and they are expecting a different way of working. Most definitely, they will not accept a 9\u20135 job in a cubicle.\nAs the metaverse kicks into gear, remote working technologies will become more advanced and intuitive, making collaboration, and socialising with friends and family across the digital highway a lot more comfortable than using the current versions of Zoom or Teams. Work from anywhere will replace work from home. First for knowledge workers who have already become accustomed to this new paradigm but later also for operational staff as digital twins and virtual and augmented reality tools become advanced enough to seamlessly operate an oil rig from the comfort of your tropical island. Of course, before we can settle in on that comfy beach chair watching the sunset while doing your work, organisations must change their mindset and cultures, drop the work from here mode, and embrace the enterprise metaverse.\nThe Enterprise Metaverse\nTechnically, the term enterprise metaverse is not the right term. After all, there is only one metaverse. For lack of a better word, I opt to use this term to indicate the difference between the metaverse used by consumers for fun, play, shopping and entertainment versus the metaverse used by organisations to enable work and collaboration across time and space.\nWhile all the entertainment in the metaverse will fuel our endorphins and drive our dopamine through the roof even more than social media does, for better or worse, the enterprise version can actually make work more fun and especially more efficient.\nIn fact, from an enterprise perspective, we are already living in version 0.1 of the metaverse, with Zooms and Teams sort of merging the physical and digital worlds and collaborative tools such as Slack or Miro enabling digital collaboration. However, these are mere windows into each other\u2019s reality and not a complete convergence of the physical and digital worlds. Neither do they provide an immersive experience, though both Zoom and Microsoft have announced immersive virtual experiences. When it comes to most of the available tools today, they are kind of flat and not really immersive.\nWith organisations required to embrace the metaverse as it comes online, the augmented employee will become the norm. This employee benefits from various technologies, including immersive technologies such as VR or AR and, more importantly, artificial intelligence, robotics or digital twins. An augmented workforce is a blend of human workers and technology seamlessly collaborating for a better outcome.\nThe First Law Enforcement Exercise in the Metaverse\nAny organisation can benefit from the metaverse, and one international organisation that did just that is the International Security Alliance. The International Security Alliance was created in 2017 and has grown from 7 to 10 member states (Bahrain, Israel, Italy, Morocco, Senegal, Singapore, Slovakia, Spain, and the founding countries, the UAE and France). It is an international working group of Interior Ministries to enhance collaboration, knowledge sharing and partnerships on global security issues, leveraging international policing experience.\nISALEX 2.0\nThe Alliance\u2019s mission is to jointly confront organised and transnational crimes and to combat violent extremism and radicalisation in all its forms to counter threats to global peace and security. The organisation organises international exercises to become better at fighting terrorism in an international setting, called ISALEX. From March 23\u201325, the Dubai World Expo 2020 hosted the ISALEX 2.0, and with the UAE known for being at the forefront of innovation, they organised the event in the metaverse.\nAccording to Major Hamad Khatir, Director of the International Operations Department at the Ministry of Interior of the United Arab Emirates, who originally conceived the idea of doing the exercise in the metaverse, the UAE chose the metaverse as it enables the design of tailor-made but real-life scenarios that teams experience in their unique and exacting roles, allowing them to engage and experience many different environments and situations with varied outcomes without any of the risks.\n\nA Unique Virtual Collaboration Across Borders\nBefore the event could occur, the organising committee dispatched VR headsets to all participating countries and trained the participants on how to use them. These logistics appeared to be more challenging than initially expected.\nThe event took place at the Engage VR platform, and I was invited as an observer to experience how dispersed law enforcement teams from across the globe worked as one team in the virtual world with physical evidence to solve the security issues presented. With different groups working on various aspects of the multi-faceted challenge, collaboration and sharing information were crucial for completing the exercise.\nThe event took place in the fictional country of Brinia, where over the course of three days, several terrorist attacks took place. It started with a drone attack on the local airport, then the hacking of traffic lights in the city and finished with the threat of a full-scale attack during a sporting event. There were witnesses to be interviewed and the Brinia social media channel to follow (for which they used the decentralised Mastodon (a free and open-source social media tool).\nThe objective of the exercise was to arrest the suspects before this attack would take place, and the police officers had to work with physical evidence, such as a Raspberry Pi found at the scene, to find them. The physical evidence had been sent prior to the exercise to all participants, adding an additional layer to the exercise and an innovative way of merging the physical and the digital.\nDoing such an international exercise in the metaverse has proven to be a major success. As Major Hamad Khatir explained, the dynamics in virtual reality were much better than on Zoom. Moreover, acting in VR removed any of the barriers and hierarchy as the participants\u2019 avatars were all donned in standard uniforms, without any ranks shown. This informal environment helped break the ice faster and resulted in a successful collaboration, despite the challenge taking place across cultures and involving team members from various ranks.\nISALEX 2.0\nEvery day, the teams were briefed in VR, and the exercise combined the use of the Engage platform as well as Zoom to communicate and discuss the findings. Law enforcers met at the scene of the drone attack, the accidents on the street due to the hacking of the traffic lights and interviewed a taxi driver who had transported the terrorist. These simulated environments offered a unique perspective to the exercise, making it a lot more realistic and enabling the dispersed teams to have a shared experience.\nThe Future of International Collaboration is Immersive\nWhile the metaverse is very much still under construction, initiatives such as ISALEX 2.0 show the potential that immersive technologies have for international organisations to collaborate and deeply connect, regardless of where people reside.\nAccording to a 2018 Capgemini report, 8 out of 10 companies implementing AR/VR have indicated that the operational benefits of using these technologies exceed their expectations. Early adopters of these technologies showed, on average, a 57% increase in efficiency, a 55% increase in safety, a 52% productivity increase and a 47% reduction in complexity. This is a few years before the pandemic, and since then, the technologies have improved significantly. As ISALEX 2.0 showed, doing technical training using virtual reality brings significant benefits for all stakeholders involved.\nAs Major Hamad Khatir mentioned, looking a bit further into the future, the metaverse will enable law enforcement from around the world to capture crime or accident scenes immediately after they happened in volumetric data, enabling dispersed teams to have access to a scene as it was using virtual reality, long after the scene has been cleaned. This could significantly improve solving crimes or help prevent future terrorist attacks.\nIn the metaverse, employees and teams can be anywhere and be either digitally or physically in the same office, meeting room or conference. The future of work is immersive, and in the coming years, we will see many more immersive scenario-driven global exercises that will change how international organisations can collaborate across borders.\nIf you want to know more about the enterprise metaverse, you can pre-order my new book now: Step into the Metaverse: How the Immersive Internet Will Unlock a Trillion-Dollar Social Economy.", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 2, "created_time": 1649828249582, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Metaverse", "Law Enforcement", "Virtual Reality", "Collaboration", "Training"]}, {"author": "Dr Mark van Rijmenam", "post_id": "51d60f094346", "user_id": "46caac0e76b", "title": "Why NFTs can be Amazing, but Not Just Yet; 5 Challenges of NFTs", "content": "Why NFTs can be Amazing, but Not Just Yet; 5 Challenges of NFTs\nImage: shykhman/Pixabay\nIn the past year, many people have been drawn into the Non-Fungible Token (NFT) collectibles, art, music, digital real estate, or digital fashion because they can relate to. A lot more than with the start of bitcoin. However, a large part of the billions in trading is done only by a very small group, and NFT trading is anything but mainstream.\nThe news about the million-dollar NFTs is mainstream, but the actual trading is not yet. So far, there have been three types of people buying NFTs. The speculators \u2014 the smart people, the insiders \u2014 who make all the money. The show-offs \u2014 those who want to show off that they are rich and can afford a Bored Ape, and the people who got in late and are trying to convince you to buy their NFT because they don\u2019t want to lose money. However, this will change as the metaverse comes to life and NFTs hold actual utility.\nA Traditional Gold Rush\nThe 2021 NFT hype is a traditional gold rush, but the hype is different from the ICO hype in 2017, which involved many scams raising funds from consumers driven by Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO). While there are certainly plenty of scams with NFTs, as we will see, with NFTs eventually offering real utility, speculation and extreme prices will likely disappear for the vast majority of NFTs simply because NFTs will become ubiquitous.\nOne of the great things that has come out of the NFT frenzy, though, is that for the first time, digital artists can get paid for their work and contribution to society. However, that does not mean that NFTs are without challenges. In fact, there are plenty, and if you are interested in minting or trading NFTs, it is important to be aware of them.\n5 Challenges of NFTs\nNFTs seem to solve digital ownership, but, as of yet, most NFTs do not consider copyright, actual legal ownership, piracy, theft or other human problems.\n1. Who Owns the Underlying Asset?\nNFTs prove that you own something that is hosted somewhere, but that does not mean that the underlying asset is truly yours. What NFTs address is that it shows that you made a transaction for a certain digital asset, so it is a verifiable receipt that indicates that you own the asset.\nThe actual NFTs \u2014 as in the actual digital artwork \u2014 are, ideally, stored on a decentralized file-sharing system such as IPFS, FileCoin or Storj, but they can also be stored on a central server such as AWS as it is often too expensive to store a large JPG, GIF, Video or MP3 decentralized. Instead, often just the web address of where the artwork is stored, is stored on the blockchain. If the items are hosted on a centralized location, the entity that runs that server can simply delete the item, even if you paid millions of dollars for it.\nA token is a smart contract pointing to the location of that web address on the blockchain (that points to the server that stores your asset), which is stored in a digital wallet. As the web address is on the blockchain, that cannot be changed, but someone can remove the asset from the server making your immutable and expensive web address return a \u2018404 not found\u2019.\nUnless your expensive artwork is stored on a decentralized storage system, you might own a receipt of a certain asset, but you certainly do not possess it, and the owner of the server where it is stored actually controls it and can delete it if wanted.\n2. Centralization in a Decentralized Ecosystem\nTherefore, it would be wise to use one of the well-known marketplaces such as OpenSea, but even that is no guarantee for success. While OpenSea uses the IPFS, since it is a centralized exchange, they also control the keys, similar to any centralized crypto exchange. If OpenSea decides to remove or freeze the digital asset because of a copyright infringement or other reason, your NFT becomes worthless, and this has happened already more than once.\nFor example, at the end of 2021, OpenSea stepped in to block the sale of stolen, expensive NFTs from collector Todd Kramer, a well-known art gallery owner, reportedly worth $2.2 million. Using a phishing attack, the NFTs were stolen from his hot wallet \u2014 a wallet connected to the internet. While it might be nice for Todd that the thief cannot resell his NFTs, it raises important questions about the decentralization of these NFTs.\n3. Hacked Wallets and Blockchain Security Challenges\nIf it is stored on decentralized storage, only the user who holds the NFT should be able to access it and control it. To make matters worse, most NFTs \u2014 the pointers to where the asset is stored \u2014 are stored on a centralized exchange, which is similar to your crypto stored on a centralized exchange, and this means that if the exchange gets hacked, you can lose your valuable NFTs.\nIf the NFT is on your decentralized wallet and is on a hot wallet connected to the internet, you are responsible for the security. As Todd Kramer discovered, if you are hacked due to a phishing scam, you can still lose your NFTs.\nTo make matters worse, NFTs are stored on a blockchain. This can be Ethereum, Solana, EOS or any of the other few dozen blockchains that enable NFTs. These blockchains are kept secure by decentralized miners or stakes, the administrators, and the more administrators, the more secure a blockchain becomes as it becomes harder to perform a so-called 51% attack.\nThis is an attack where a group of miners hold more than 50% of the network\u2019s hashing rate, and as they control the majority, they can reverse transactions that were completed while the group were in control. Meaning they could double-spend tokens, which is the entire promise that blockchains aims to prevent.\nBlockchains that become the victim to a 51% attack will probably not live very long, and if your NFTs are stored on such a blockchain, your NFTs might become completely worthless. Of course, most of the NFTs reside on Ethereum, which has a broad adoption and is truly decentralised due to its age,. However, this comes at a cost as Ethereum\u2019s gas fees, the price that needs to be paid to record a transaction, has gone through the roof, which makes the network prone to inequality to the extent that many organizations have tried to prevent in Web 2.0.\nThere are also other chains used for NFTs which will be cheaper to use, but these might be more centralized and, therefore, have weaker security. This all means that for NFTs to achieve mass adoption, transaction costs need to go down, ideally to zero or close to zero, while decentralization needs to go up to ensure that an NFT purchased today for $10.000 is still holds value in the future.\n4. Fat Finger Mistakes\nIf you are unlucky, you bought an expensive NFT and either your wallet can get hacked, the security of the blockchain storing the NFT can be breached, or the centralized database storing your actual artwork can be hacked, and the criminal can delete the actual asset, in which case you still hold the NFT pointing to a web address pointing to a server, but since there is nothing on that server, you own nothing.\nIf that does not happen, then you still have your own responsibility to make sure that when you do sell your Bored Ape, you do not sell it for the wrong price, as happened to NFT owner Max who accidentally sold his bored ape for 0.75 ETH (around $3000) instead of 75 ETH (around $300.000). Before the owner could fix his mistake, a bot had snapped up the unique collector\u2019s item by sending the transaction with 8 ETH (around $34000) of gas fees to ensure it was instantly processed.\nThese so-called fat-finger errors have happened before. While it is annoying for the original owner, it also shows a bigger problem that has been causing many debates around the world in the past years; net neutrality. The objective of net neutrality has always been to give everyone equal access to the internet and that internet service providers (ISPs) must treat all internet communications equally. Obviously, due to the gas fees, this no longer applies in the world of blockchain, which could pose a threat for the future, further increasing the digital divide and inequality.\n5. Scams and Copyright Infringements\nUnfortunately, that is not all, there are also plenty of scams and copyright infringements, or some call it satire or art in itself, of famous and expensive NFT collectibles such as the Bored Ape Yacht Club. One example is the Phunky Ape Yacht Club (or PAYC) which simply flipped the right-facing Bored Apes to face left and resold them, making around $1.8 million in the process.\nPAYC has since been banned from centralized markets such as OpenSea, Raible and Mintable, which again shows the power these centralized markets have by creating a seamless trading experience for the masses.\nSuppose you are lucky, and all works fine. In that case, you are still not yet out of the woods because it might very well be that the NFT you bought does not come with the right IP or copyrights, potentially preventing you from monetizing it and only using it as a nice image to view in your wallet or virtual home, which everyone else can do as well.\nIn fact, most NFTs sold in 2021 did not come with any copyright or IP, meaning that you cannot monetize the NFT, which is a crucial component for a vibrant economy. The collection of the Bored Ape Yacht Club does as we discussed, resulting in a vibrant community and steep prices, but most collectibles don\u2019t, and all you have is a pointer towards an item stored somewhere, which is not a sustainable solution if NFTs are meant to achieve mass adoption.\nFinal Thoughts\nIf the above shows anything, it is important to always do your own research before diving in, as is the case with trading cryptocurrencies. Of course, this seems all very depressing, and it is, but it is not the end of the world. After all, it is still early days.\nAs the legal system catches up and the blockchain ecosystem continues to evolve and develop, i.e., truly decentralized storage of your digital assets, interoperable blockchains and minimum to no transaction fees become feasible, all the above problems will likely disappear.\nDespite these challenges, NFTs are still a much better system than the current centralized approach, where a company can simply delete years of your work with a click of a button. NFTs that offer utility are amazing, and NFTs will define the metaverse economy, but we will first need to solve these five NFT challenges.\nThis article is part of my research for my fourth book, available for pre-order now: Step into the Metaverse: How the Immersive Internet Will Unlock a Trillion-Dollar Social Economy.", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 19, "created_time": 1647523961711, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Nft", "Bayc", "Crypto", "Challenge", "Metaverse"]}, {"author": "Dr Mark van Rijmenam", "post_id": "2464f9f21169", "user_id": "46caac0e76b", "title": "What is the Metaverse, and How Will It Change Society?", "content": "What is the Metaverse, and How Will It Change Society?\nWhat is the Metaverse, and How Will It Change Society?\n\n\u201cAny sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.\u201d \u2014 Arthur C Clarke, 1973\nNow that we are at the dawn of the metaverse, this will become truer than ever before. Although the metaverse is currently only as far as the internet was at the end of the 1990s, in the coming years, thanks to the convergence of technologies, the metaverse will arrive at an exponential speed.\nBefore the end of this decade, we will have converted the mobile, or social internet, to an immersive, omnipresent, persistent internet, where magic seems to happen constantly. As such, the metaverse will usher in a new age; the Imagination Age.\nThe Imagination Age\nDesigner and writer Charlie Magee first coined the Imagination Age in 1993. It is a theoretical period after the Information Age when creativity and imagination become the primary drivers of economic value. The combination of many jobs being replaced by artificial intelligence and robotics and a metaverse driven by the creator economy will unleash the Imagination Age in all its force, getting it out of the realm of theory and into the real world.\nIf we build it correctly, the metaverse will reward creativity like never before. Using the transformative power of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), it will enable content creators to monetise their work and contribute to a rich, vibrant and magical metaverse. It will empower content creators to earn a living, and creativity will be rewarded based on how the community perceives it. In the metaverse, anyone can be a creator, share their creations with the world, and monetise their work using Decentralised Finance.\nWhat is the Metaverse?\nBut what is the metaverse? The metaverse can be seen as the next iteration of the internet: a version that supports immersive, interactive, and persistent online digital experiences such as Decentraland, Microsoft Mesh, Pok\u00e9mon Go or Fortnite and anything that will be invented in the years to come. The metaverse is not a single place, let alone one specific virtual world as portrayed in Ready Player One.\nIn fact, let\u2019s get one misconception out of the way; there is only one metaverse. Similar to that there is only one internet. Of course, there can and will be infinite spaces, worlds, environments, or experiences within this metaverse where people can relax, be entertained, socialise, work, or collaborate. But any company claiming that they are building a metaverse is akin to companies claiming they are building an internet.\nThe convergence of the physical and digital worlds\nThe metaverse will be the convergence of the physical and the digital world where all of our data \u2014 such as identity, personality, reputation, and assets, but also the entire history, feeling, and/or emotion of any (virtual or physical) place, organisation or thing \u2014 can be interacted with, controlled and experienced in entirely novel ways so that people, and things, can create new, magical, experiences, interactions, and environments.\nSome of these worlds will be walled gardens such as Meta\u2019s Horizon Worlds or Epic Games\u2019 Fortnite. At the same time, the majority of the metaverse, if we build it correctly, can be open, decentralised, community-driven, and user-controlled. Companies such as The Sandbox or Decentraland are leading the way here. Of course, not everything can be open and community-driven. Some environments will be secure virtual spaces only accessible if you have the right digital key, similar to how most offices are only accessible with the right physical key. You won\u2019t be able to teleport into the Pentagon just yet!\nIn addition, the metaverse is also a lot more than just these virtual worlds. Augmented reality will likely become a lot more important than VR in the metaverse. First of all, because it is simply not very comfortable to constantly walk around with a bulky VR headset, but more importantly because the physical world will offer infinite possibilities to be enriched. We can create all kinds of layers on top of reality, ranging from entertainment, tourist information, traffic information, digital twin insights and many more that can be experienced with lightweight AR glasses or, in the future, smart contact lenses.\nFinal Thoughts\nThe convergence of the digital and the physical worlds will enable yet to be developed applications similar to how the internet created completely new applications we could impossibly foresee in the mid-1990s. The metaverse will change society as drastically as Web 1.0 did, and it will offer infinite opportunities for organisations, artists, and content creators to create value.\nThe immersive internet will enable humanity to experience the real and the digital in ways we could never imagine before and unlock trillions of dollars in value for society. However, we should aim for developing an open metaverse versus a closed metaverse owned by Big Tech if we want to create the most value for society as a whole, instead of for a tiny elite. If we manage to do so, we can expect a continuously evolving, decentralised, and creator-driven ecosystem that delivers infinite opportunities to create value.\nThis article is part of my research for my fourth book, available for pre-order now: Step into the Metaverse: How the Immersive Internet Will Unlock a Trillion-Dollar Social Economy.\nImage: Oleg Gamulinskiy from Pixabay\nOriginal article: https://www.thedigitalspeaker.com/what-is-the-metaverse-how-change-society/\nIf I managed to retain your attention to this point, please leave a comment or subscribe to my weekly newsletter to receive more of this content:\n\nDr Mark van Rijmenam is The Digital Speaker and he offers inspirational (virtual) keynotes on the future of work, either in-person, as an avatar or as a hologram, bringing your event to the next level:\n", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 2, "created_time": 1644896334098, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Metaverse", "Phygital", "Immersive Internet", "Digital", "Society"]}, {"author": "Laszlo Fazekas", "post_id": "d2915a719443", "user_id": "792a8f999852", "title": "Megaminds, abstract evolution and the consistency machine,", "content": "Megaminds, abstract evolution and the consistency machine,\naka how to build simulated realities\nSource: https://adamburn.deviantart.com/art/SHield-World-Construction-118068881\nMind uploading and simulated reality are the holy grail of science and technology. Mind uploading is the key to eternal life and gives godlike power in a new, \u201cself-made\u201d (simulated) reality. If you are not familiar with mind uploading, you can find here a short introduction.\nMind uploading is a computer simulation of the human brain. According to the present state of science, our brain is a network, built from an inconceivably big amount of neurons, and our consciousness is the result of the operation of these neurons. There is no law of physics that prevents us to copy the operation of these neurons and build software that works the totally identical way as our brain does. Sounds easy, but it is a huge technological challenge. Maybe the biggest (but last) challenge in the history of the human kind. As a technological challenge, it is only a question of time when we will be able to solve it. Thanks to exponential technologies like nanotechnology, brain scan, computer science, etc. it can be solved in a not too distant future.\nWill we ever be able to build human level intelligence? The human brain is too complex to understand. We will never be able to do it\u2026\nSo, it is not needed to understand how the human brain works. We have to understand how the neurons and synapses work, and we need the technology to copy the structure of the human brain. Mind uploading is the key, how we can build human level intelligence without understanding of the human brain. This would be also the key for brain-machine interfaces. We don\u2019t have to understand the human brain to decode the signals. Thanks to big data and machine learning techniques, we only need a huge set of sample brain signals, what we can use to train a machine to read our mind. We won\u2019t understand how the algorithm works, and won\u2019t know anything about how our brain works, but we will be able to decode the brain signals, and build brain-machine interfaces.\nIf our consciousness is the operation of our neurons, the simulation would be totally identical to us. Not a copy of us, it would be us!\nIf you are interested in mind uploading, you can read more about it in book of Ray Kurzweil: Singularity is near\nMind uploading could be the key to eternal life, for real interstellar space travel (we should send only our digital form) and simulated reality. I think this will be the very last invention of human kind because if we can do it, there won\u2019t be any more problems to solve. No more poverty, climate problems, overpopulation, wars, scarce resources, etc. because we will be able to build our own realities where these problems do not exist. Let\u2019s see how\u2026\nThe very first idea of everyone is to simulate the reality particle by particle as we simulate the brain neuron by neuron. But I think it is wasteful and impracticable. Accurate simulation of some particles needs huge computing capacity (think the equations of the quantum mechanics), simulation of the whole world needs much more. So, the simulation of every particle seems unsolvable. The good news is we don\u2019t need to do this. Our brain is connected to reality through a thin channel, the sensory system, and we have to simulate only the sensory stimuli. Just imagine an apple. For our brain, this apple is not a set of particles, but a set of stimuli (visual stimuli, touch stimuli, taste, smell, etc.). So, it is enough to simulate these stimuli instead of particle-level simulation. It solves two problems. The generation of these stimuli needs much less computing capacity like particle-level simulation, and things which are not observed by anyone are not needed to simulate. If we put the apple in a box, it is not needed to simulate any more, because we don\u2019t see it, don\u2019t taste it, etc. The apple does not exist for us until we don\u2019t get it out. The things that are not observed do not exist. Some interpretations of quantum mechanics look at reality in the same way. This solution radically reduces the needed computing capacity, but there is a problem with it. We need particle-level simulation for generating the correct stimuli. In the case of an apple, the simulated apple will act like an apple only if we simulate every biological, chemical, and physical activity. After some week, the apple should be robbed, if I compress it, its levier runs out, if I bite it, it gets brown, etc. It is only possible if every physical activity is simulated which are processed in the apple. An easier example, if I bite the apple and close my eyes. The apple won\u2019t be observed, it is not needed to simulate, and it doesn\u2019t exist anymore. What will happen if I open my eyes and continue the observation? The apple should be there with the bite, otherwise, it will be realized, it isn\u2019t real, but only a simulation. So, the system has to store the state of every object and continue the simulation of the non-observed things. We got back to the starting point: we need near-infinite storage and computing capacity (particle-level simulation) if we want to build a perfect simulated reality. The good news: there is a tricky way to solve this problem. In fact, physical laws are not relevant, but the expectations of the observer. When I open my eyes, I expect the apple to be there with the bite. We can generally say, every act is an experiment where we want to prove we are living in a computer simulation. The experiment failed if the result is different from what is expected. So, the simulator should generate stimuli that meet our expectations. In this case, we won't be able to prove we are living in a computer simulation, because every result of our experiments will show it is the reality. This is the point where simulated reality meets mind uploading because the simulator has to read our mind and the easiest way to do it if it is also simulated. So, if the simulator can read our mind, then nothing has to be stored and only observed things (set of stimuli) have to be simulated.\nIn the rest of the article, I will write about the simulator, and how can it work. I\u2019m not an expert in neuroscience, so what I will write about is built upon what I\u2019ve read on the topic. As I\u2019ve written, I think mind uploading (and mind-reading) will be necessary to build a \u201creality equivalent\u201d simulated reality. Don\u2019t forget, that we are building worlds for neural matrices (uploaded minds), and the goal is to build a network of them by keeping some rules. If we look at these minds as matrices, and the simulations as an algorithm that is running on them, then it will be easier to accept things like non-linear time, what I will write about later.\nAs I\u2019ve written, in a perfect simulated reality, it is enough to simulate things that are observed if the simulation meets our expectations. In this case, it is not possible anyway to prove it is a simulation. It sounds like the brain should work in a reverse way. When we observe the world, our brain converts sensory information to abstract things, and then memories. When the simulator builds the expected reality, this should be processed backward. Remember to the sample experiment with the apple. When I bite the apple, my brain creates a memory about the bite in the apple. When I close my eyes, the apple won\u2019t exist anymore. When I open my eyes, the simulator has to render the apple (a set of stimuli) based on our memories. It is something like a reversed perception. I think, our brain can do this because when we are dreaming, it does something like this. This is also the base of Google\u2019s DeepDream algorithm, which was used to generate that famous hallucination like images. These images are generated by backward processed convolutional neural networks. What we see is the visualized knowledge (memories), which are stored in the network. So, I think, DeepDream is a good name for this algorithm, because the process is something like our brain do when we are dreaming. So, this solution sounds good for building simulated realities which meet the expectations of the observer. But it is not enough to build the whole reality because there are many details in which the brain has no information or any memories. Every detail which was not memorized, every place which was never visited are unknown things. These details can be built by the simulator from freely generated stimuli and details which are read from the observer\u2019s mind.\nIf you are interested in how our brain projects the reality, watch this TED talk of Anil Seth (Cognitive neuroscientist): https://www.ted.com/talks/anil_seth_how_your_brain_hallucinates_your_conscious_reality\nOf course, a world like this would be really lonely if there wouldn\u2019t be some other mind besides us. To keep the world consistent, it has to meet the expectations of every mind. If I left my apple somewhere, the other people should find it there. Every observer has to experience the same reality. The simulator has to operate every mind parallel on a backward way to build a perfect, consistent reality. It is something like the reality would be a mosaic, and every mind would add a part of it. If we are thinking in \u201csubsystems\u201d, our simulated reality looks something like this: Every mind are connected to an upper, common layer through the sensory system. The minds are getting stimuli from this layer (observe the reality), and also send stimuli which are generated from memories by backward operation of the mind (reality projection). This common layer is responsible for building a valid intersection of these stimuli, and a reality (set of stimuli) which are the same for everyone. This layer is responsible for keeping the reality consistent, this is why I call it: \u201cconsistency machine\u201d. So, the consistency machine is the simulator itself, but it simulates nothing, only creates a valid intersection of the set of stimuli, this is why I think the consistency machine is a better name for it.\nIn many brain model, the brain is a hierarchical and modular neural structure. Small modules are built from neurons, and other modules are built from these modules, some bigger modules are built from these modules, etc. There is two-way communication between the modules, and conscious information is the result of these. When any stimuli are coming from the sensory system, it activates low-level modules, which are activating higher-level modules. These higher-level modules activate higher-level modules, which respond back, etc. This system is massively parallel, and this gives its huge power. If we see an apple, many low-level modules are activating, which are assigned to curves, colors, etc. These modules activate higher-level modules, like the \u201cmodule of a sphere\u201d. The \u201csphere module\u201d activates higher-level modules, like \u201cplanet module\u201d, \u201cball module\u201d, etc. and the \u201capple module\u201d. But higher-level modules respond back, it cannot be a planet, because it is smaller, it cannot be a ball, etc. After a short time, the \u201capple module\u201d wins, and the concept of an apple will come up to the conscious level with every connected property like taste, touch, smell, etc. So, our brain is continuous \u201crustling\u201d, signals are flashes up and down between modules, and after a short time, a concept is manifesting on the conscious level. Thinking is something similar process. From a thought, our brain associates the other thought, and new concepts will be generated through the process.\nIf you are interested in the hierarchical pattern recognizer model of the human brain, you can read more about it in the book of Ray Kurzweil: How to create a mind\nIn the case of an apple, we can imagine, how this process works, but can this simple method operates such a complex thing like the human brain? It is hard to imagine how this works, but it is not the model\u2019s fault. We cannot really imagine how these huge, massively parallel networks work.\nThe human brain contains ~90bn neurons. 90bn small processors which are connected on many ways. But how much is 90bn? Let\u2019s count it! If we can say a number in 1 second then the counting would be >170 000 years. Near the whole human history. It is an inconceivably big number. But really can the operation of these simple neurons results the consciousness? There are many cases when use of a very simple rule results a very complex thing. Let\u2019s think of DNA. Only four base (adenine, thymine, guanine, cytosine) can describe every living form on the Earth. Or in the computer science. A simple logic function (NAND) is enough to build every logic circuit, every processor or algorithm, every program which are ever existed or will exist.\nSo, I think, it is an acceptable model of the human brain. I\u2019ve written about the hierarchical model of the human brain to show, how it fits into our simulated reality model. The consistency machine can be simply one or more layer upon the uploaded minds, which are themselves also a set of hierarchical modules. Uploaded minds communicate to these modules through the sensory system like the modules communicate with each other inside them. In this system, the sensory system is not a \u201cwindow to outside\u201d, only a level of the organization. So, maybe, it is possible to add the consistency machine as new modules to the uploaded minds and build a \u201cmegamind\u201d from them which is able to simulate reality without any other component, using the natural behavior of the mind. In the system of interconnected minds, individuality is on the middle layer, not on the top, and reality is something like a collective, endless dream. A megamind solves the consistency problem in the following way: when individual minds project some components of the reality, the upper layers (what I\u2019ve called \u2018consistency machine\u2019) merge them and send back the generated reality. If this reality is inconsistent with a mind, it sends back the \u2018error\u2019, and the \u2018consistency machine\u2019 modifies the reality. After the end of this communication, there will be generated a consistent concept of reality. This is exactly the same way, how an individual mind creates a conscious concept from the inputs which came from the sensory system. This system can solve the consistency problem not only in space but also in time. As I\u2019ve told, the reality is generated from memories of the minds. If something is not stored in any individual mind, then it does not exist. If nobody has any memory of an event, it has not happened. This is why a megamind can keep consistency in time. If something happened in the past which results in consistency in the future, the contradiction can go down in the layers of modules and can change the memories. In this system, memories are the past. So, if memories are changed then the past is changed! It is something like \u2018time-traveling\u2019. Something bad happened? No problem! Go back in time, and change it! This method can keep the consistency, and also protect the reality because if any mind finds any proof of simulation, the \u2018consistency machine travels back in time\u2019 and make it hasn't happened. Time is non-linear in this world. Linear time is only the way how individual minds experience happenings. Time doesn\u2019t exist globally, but only on the level of individual minds.\nSo, what is a megamind? It is a very special living form. One mind, one living thing for an outside observer. It is something like a god in its own universe because it creates and operates it. But it has no individuality because inside, this superintelligence is split into many individual minds. One huge mind dreams itself as many minds which are living in a simulated reality. This state of consciousness is something that we cannot imagine. It is over the singularity. But what would be the physical form of it? A giant biology-based brain? A huge computer, like a Matrioshka brain? Maybe. But for the end of the article, I have a more extreme variation. How good the universe is a megamind?\nIn the current state of the art, our universe has been created from nothing many billion years ago by the big bang. It is built from particles which are based on one simple structure: the superstring. Every particle is a form of these superstrings. There are some physical rules what operate the system and change the state of these particles. Why these rules? Why superstrings? etc. Nobody knows. These are the axioms of our universe. From the perspective of math (which is the best perspective, I think), the Universe is a big state matrix (state of the strings), and state-changing operations (physical rules) are operating on it. If we look at our Universe from this perspective, a megamind is not really different. A megamind is built from neurons instead of strings (or particles), and there are some rules (like physical rules) that operate the system. Every neuron has a state, and interact with each other by the \u2018neural rules\u2019 (this is the \u2018physics\u2019 of the megamind) like particles interact with each other by the physical rules. I think, if you leave it alone for some billion years, life can be formed spontaneously like it spontaneously formed in our universe. I think evolution can also work in this universe, but here the result is not life in the traditional meaning, but the consciousness and the individual minds. This is why I call it \u2018abstract evolution\u2019. So, I think, a megamind at least as the good universe like ours. Can we say anything about the other universe if we know only our universe? Not really. But just one thing! If we were living in a megamind universe, can we find any proof of it, or we find it exactly the same as our current universe? I wish you good thinking\u2026\nIf you are interested in the neural network theory of the Universe, read my article on the topic:\nOur Universe Is A Massive Neural Network: Here's Why | Hacker Noon\nSome days ago, I read an article on arXiv from Vitaly Vanchurin about 'The world as a neural network'.

I have no exact data, but it costs billions of dollars. Managing the voting process and counting votes needs a really huge amount of human work. Can we do it better, cheaper, and more secure? The answer is yes! The cost of a blockchain-based voting system would be only a fraction of this money, and it would be much safer than the current paper-based method. In this article, I would show how this blockchain-based system would work.\nThe method of paper-based voting is the following:\nAfter an identification process, you get a ballot, and a poll worker marks your name on his list. This ensures that you get only one ballot.\nYou fill the ballot and put it into the ballot box.\nWhen the voting day finishes, poll workers count the votes.\nThis is the classical, paper-based voting method. It\u2019s not a bad method, and not easy to cheat in it, but it has several attack points. If the poll workers are fraudulent, then they can skip ballots from counting, or help malicious actors to vote more times, etc. Another disadvantage of this method is the huge amount of human work, but the technology of blockchain can solve these problems.\nWhy blockchain? Blockchain is a public and immutable database of transactions. Everybody can track the voting method in real-time, and detect any malicious behavior.\nWhen somebody votes, the system writes his unique identifier (hash of the driving license, or security number, etc.) to the blockchain and checks if he already voted, so double voting is impossible. Because of the immutability removing votes is also impossible, and if the list of possible voters is written to the blockchain in the preparation phase then fake voting (voting with a non-existent identity) is also impossible.\nThe only way to cheat the system is if somebody votes instead of some other person, but we can prevent it in different ways:\nthe real voter can detect the malicious voter by checking the blockchain (because the data are public), and making a report\none or more witnesses testifies that the voter used his real identity (false testimony is a crime)\nidentity proof can be stored for the vote (ex.: a video where the voter shows his driving license to prove his identity) \u2014 this can be used as proof of the witnesses were malicious\nBy using these methods, blockchain-based voting is more secure than the paper-based method. Because of immutability and publicity, the voting method is fully verifiable even if the voting happened online through a video conference system, which is more comfortable than paper-based voting in a polling place.\nThe only question is anonymity. How can this system prove the same anonymity as paper-based voting? The answer is zero-knowledge proof.\nWith zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) you can prove something without revealing any information about it. In the case of anonymous voting, the voter generates a public and a secret token. After the identification, he sends the public token to the system that writes it to the blockchain. When he votes, he uses the secret token and a ZKP that proves that the secret token is assigned to one of the public tokens without revealing the public token. This system ensures that every registered voter can vote only once, but nobody can assign the voter to his vote. This makes the system anonymous, and this anonymity is mathematically provable! (I have a full article about zero-knowledge proofs. It is highly recommended to read it to understand how ZKP works. In the article the public token is called \u2018commitment\u2019, and the secret token is \u2018nullifier\u2019.)\nNow we have everything to build our blockchain-based voting system. Let\u2019s see the process:\nInstead of getting a ballot, the voter sends his public token to the poll workers.\nThe poll workers identify the voter (by using his driving license, etc.) and write the public token to the blockchain with the unique identifier of the voter and optionally the validation proof (ex.: a video where the voter identifies himself). The whole process can be done online, and the validation proof is digitally signed by the poll workers.\nThe voter votes by his secret token that cannot be assigned to the public token, so nobody can assign the voter to his vote.\nIn this system counting of votes is done automatically and in real-time without any manual intervention.\nAs you see, it\u2019s absolutely possible to build a highly secure and cheap online voting system based on blockchain, that can be used for the presidential election, referendums, or in any case where voting is needed. It\u2019s almost impossible to cheat this system, so there is no valid reason to use paper-based (in place or postal voting) voting anymore\u2026\n(A PoC in Solidity is coming soon\u2026)", "comment_count": 2, "like_count": 82, "created_time": 1648902765030, "comment": [{"user_id": "792a8f999852", "comment_time": 1648902765030, "comment": "Thank you for sharing!"}, {"user_id": "9e7b4c801e05", "comment_time": 1648911121947, "comment": "Forgive me for insisting that this is another solution in search of a problem, for all the reasons I already explained here, and in all the posts linked from that one:"}, {"user_id": "5881a613398e", "comment_time": 1648925743436, "comment": "i am giving a lot of thought to a system like this"}], "post_tag": ["Blockchain", "Blockchain Technology", "Voting", "Zero Knowledge Proofs"]}, {"author": "Laszlo Fazekas", "post_id": "41d335c5475f", "user_id": "792a8f999852", "title": "Understanding Zero-Knowledge Proofs Through the Source Code of Tornado Cash", "content": "Understanding Zero-Knowledge Proofs Through the Source Code of Tornado Cash\nDive into the world of smart contracts with Zero-knowledge proof\nSource: https://unsplash.com/photos/JrrWC7Qcmhs\nBased on Wikipedia, the definition of the Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) is the following:\n\u2026 zero-knowledge proof or zero-knowledge protocol is a method by which one party (the prover) can prove to another party (the verifier) that a given statement is true while the prover avoids conveying any additional information apart from the fact that the statement is indeed true. The essence of zero-knowledge proofs is that it is trivial to prove that one possesses knowledge of certain information by simply revealing it; the challenge is to prove such possession without revealing the information itself or any additional information.\nThe technology of ZKP can be widely used in many different fields like anonymous voting or anonymous money transfer that are difficult to solve on a public database like the blockchain.\nTornado Cash is a coin mixer that you can use to anonymize your Ethereum transactions. Because of the logic of the blockchain, every transaction is public. If you have some ETH on your account, you cannot transfer it anonymously, because anybody can follow your transaction history on the blockchain. Coin mixers, like Tornado Cash, can solve this privacy problem by breaking the on-chain link between the source and the destination address by using ZKP.\nIf you want to anonymize one of your transactions, you have to deposit a small amount of ETH (or ERC20 token) on the Tornado Cash contract (ex.: 1 ETH). After a little while, you can withdraw this 1 ETH with a different account. The trick is that nobody can create a link between the depositor account and the withdrawal account. If hundreds of accounts deposit 1 ETH on one side and the other hundreds of accounts withdraw 1 ETH on the other side, then nobody will be able to follow the path where the money moves. The technical challenge is that smart contract transactions are also public like any other transaction on the Ethereum network. This is the point where ZKP will be relevant.\nWhen you deposit your 1 ETH on the contract, you have to provide a \u201ccommitment\u201d. This commitment is stored by the smart contract. When you withdraw 1 ETH on the other side, you have to provide a \u201cnullifier\u201d and a zero-knowledge proof. The nullifier is a unique ID that is in connection with the commitment and the ZKP proves the connection, but nobody knows which nullifier is assigned to which commitment (except the owner of the depositor/withdrawal account).\nAgain: We can prove that one of the commitments is assigned to our nullifier, without revealing our commitment.\nThe nullifiers are tracked by the smart contract, so we can withdraw only one deposited ETH with one nullifier.\nSounds easy? It\u2019s not! :) Let\u2019s go deep inside the technology. But before anything, we have to understand another tricky thing, the Merkle tree.\nsource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree\nMerkle trees are hash trees, where the leaves are the elements, and every node is a hash of the child nodes. The root of the tree is the Merkle root, which represents the whole set of elements. If you add, remove, or change any element (leaf) in the tree, the Merkle root will change. The Merkle root is a unique identifier of the set of elements. But how can we use it?\n\nThere is another thing called Merkle proof. If I have a Merkle root, you can send me a Merkle proof that proves that an element is in the set that is represented by the root. The figure below shows how is it working. If you want to prove to me that HK is in the set, you have to send me the HL, HIJ, HMNOP, and HABCDEFGH hashes. Using these hashes I can calculate the Merkle root. If the root is the same as my root then HK is in the set. Where can we use it?\nA simple example is whitelisting. Imagine a smart contract that has a method that can be called by only whitelisted users. The problem is that there are 1000 whitelisted accounts. How can you store them on the smart contract? The simple way is to store every account in mapping, but it is very expensive. A cheaper solution is building a Merkle tree, and storing the Merkle root only (1 hash vs 1000 is not bad). If somebody wants to call the method she has to give a Merkle proof (in this case it is a list of 10 hashes) that can be easily validated by the smart contract.\nAgain: A Merkle tree is used to represent a set of elements with one hash (the Merkle root). The existence of an element can be proven by the Merkle proof.\nThe next thing that we have to understand is the zero-knowledge proof itself. With ZKP, you can prove that you know something without revealing the thing that you know. For generating a ZKP, you need a circuit. A circuit is something like a small program that has public inputs and outputs, and private inputs. These private inputs are the knowledge that you don\u2019t reveal for the verification, this is why it is called zero-knowledge proof. With ZKP, we can prove that the output can be generated from the inputs with the given circuit.\nA simple circuit looks like this:\npragma circom 2.0.0;\n\ninclude \"node_modules/circomlib/circuits/bitify.circom\";\ninclude \"node_modules/circomlib/circuits/pedersen.circom\";\n\ntemplate Main() {\n    signal input nullifier;\n    signal output nullifierHash;\n\n    component nullifierHasher = Pedersen(248);\n    component nullifierBits = Num2Bits(248);\n\n    nullifierBits.in <== nullifier;\n    for (var i = 0; i < 248; i++) {\n        nullifierHasher.in[i] <== nullifierBits.out[i];\n    }\n\n    nullifierHash <== nullifierHasher.out[0];\n}\n\ncomponent main = Main();\nUsing this circuit, we can prove that we know the source of the given hash. This circuit has one input (the nullifier) and one output (the nullifier hash). The default accessibility of the inputs is private, and the outputs are always public. This circuit uses 2 libraries from the Circomlib. Circomlib is a set of useful circuits. The first library is bitlify that contains bit manipulation methods, and the second is pedersen which contains the Pedersen hasher. Pedersen hashing is a hashing method that can be run efficiently in ZKP circuits. In the body of the Main template, we fill the hasher and calculate the hash. (For more info about the circom language, please take a look at the circom documentation)\nFor generating the zero-knowledge proof, you will need a proving key. This is the most sensitive part of ZKP because using the source data that is used to generate the proving key, anybody could generate fake proofs. This source data is called the \u201ctoxic waste\u201d that has to be dropped. Because of this, there is a \u201cceremony\u201d for generating the proving key. The ceremony has many members and every member contribute to the proving key. Only one non-malicious member is enough to generate a valid proving key. Using the private inputs, the public inputs, and the proving key, the ZKP system can run the circuit and generate the Proof and the outputs.\n\nThere is a validation key for the proving key that can be used for the validation. The validation system uses the public inputs, the outputs, and the validation key to validate the proof.\n\nSnarkjs is a full-featured tool to generate the proving key and the verification key by the ceremony, generate the proof, and validate it. It can also generate a smart contract for the verification, that can be used by any other contract to validate the zero-knowledge proof. For more information, please look at the snarkjs documentation.\nNow, we have everything to understand how Tornado Cash (TC) works. When you deposit 1 ETH on the TC contract, you have to provide a commitment hash. This commitment hash will be stored in a Merkle tree. When you withdraw this 1 ETH with a different account, you have to provide 2 zero-knowledge proofs. The first proves that the Merkel tree contains your commitment. This proof is a zero-knowledge proof of a Merkle proof. But this is not enough, because you should be allowed to withdraw this 1 ETH only once. Because of this, you have to provide a nullifier that is unique for the commitment. The contract stores this nullifier, this ensures that you don\u2019t be able to withdraw the deposited money more than one time.\nThe uniqueness of the nullifier is ensured by the commitment generation method. The commitment is generated from the nullifier and a secret by hashing. If you change the nullifier then the commitment will change, so one nullifier can be used for only one commitment. Because of the one-way nature of hashing, it\u2019s not possible to link the commitment and the nullifier, but we can generate a ZKP for it.\n\nAfter the theory, let\u2019s see how the withdraw circuit of TC looks like:\ninclude \"../node_modules/circomlib/circuits/bitify.circom\";\ninclude \"../node_modules/circomlib/circuits/pedersen.circom\";\ninclude \"merkleTree.circom\";\n// computes Pedersen(nullifier + secret)\ntemplate CommitmentHasher() {\n    signal input nullifier;\n    signal input secret;\n    signal output commitment;\n    signal output nullifierHash;\n    component commitmentHasher = Pedersen(496);\n    component nullifierHasher = Pedersen(248);\n    component nullifierBits = Num2Bits(248);\n    component secretBits = Num2Bits(248);\n    nullifierBits.in <== nullifier;\n    secretBits.in <== secret;\n    for (var i = 0; i < 248; i++) {\n        nullifierHasher.in[i] <== nullifierBits.out[i];\n        commitmentHasher.in[i] <== nullifierBits.out[i];\n        commitmentHasher.in[i + 248] <== secretBits.out[i];\n    }\n    commitment <== commitmentHasher.out[0];\n    nullifierHash <== nullifierHasher.out[0];\n}\n// Verifies that commitment that corresponds to given secret and nullifier is included in the merkle tree of deposits\ntemplate Withdraw(levels) {\n    signal input root;\n    signal input nullifierHash;\n    signal private input nullifier;\n    signal private input secret;\n    signal private input pathElements[levels];\n    signal private input pathIndices[levels];\n    component hasher = CommitmentHasher();\n    hasher.nullifier <== nullifier;\n    hasher.secret <== secret;\n    hasher.nullifierHash === nullifierHash;\n    component tree = MerkleTreeChecker(levels);\n    tree.leaf <== hasher.commitment;\n    tree.root <== root;\n    for (var i = 0; i < levels; i++) {\n        tree.pathElements[i] <== pathElements[i];\n        tree.pathIndices[i] <== pathIndices[i];\n    }\n}\ncomponent main = Withdraw(20);\nThe first template is the CommitmentHasher. It has two inputs, the nullifier and the secret which are two random 248-bit numbers. The template calculates the nullifier hash and the commitment hash which is a hash of the nullifier and the secret as I wrote before.\nThe second template is the Withdraw itself. It has 2 public inputs, the Merkle root, and the nullifierHash. The Merkle root is needed to verify the Merkle proof, and the nullifierHash is needed by the smart contract to store it. The private input parameters are the nullifier, the secret, and the pathElements and pathIndices of the Merkle proof. The circuit checks the nullifier by generating the commitment from it and from the secret and also checks the given Merkle proof. If everything is fine, the zero-knowledge proof will be generated that can be validated by the TC smart contract.\nYou can find the smart contracts in the contracts folder in the repo. The Verifier is generated from the circuit. It is used by the Tornado contract to verify the ZKP for the given nullifier hash and Merkle root.\nThe easiest way to use the contract is the command-line interface. It is written in JavaScript, and its source code is relatively simple. You can easily find where the parameters and the ZKP are generated and used to call the smart contract.\nZero-knowledge proof is relatively new in the crypto world. The math behind it is really complex and hard to understand, but tools like snarkjs and circom make it easy to use. I hope, this article helps you to understand this \u201cmagical\u201d technology, and you can use ZKP in your next project.\nHappy coding\u2026", "comment_count": 1, "like_count": 131, "created_time": 1646638475645, "comment": [{"user_id": "792a8f999852", "comment_time": 1646638475645, "comment": "Thank you for sharing!"}, {"user_id": "29b2f76c0b2e", "comment_time": 1649525088763, "comment": "This is such an interesting way to solve an interesting problem.

When Viktor Tr\u00f3n and Daniel Nagy joined the Ethereum Foundation in 2015, they took over the project within the Foundation\u2019s Geth team. It was more than 5 years ago. Now, in 2022 Swarm is more or less feature complete, and started its own long journey as an autonomous project. Swarm has its own foundation and finished its initial token offering with more than a $15 million investment.\nIn this article, I will show you why Swarm is an exciting project, and what unique features (like feeds and direct messaging) make it different from other storage solutions.\nEthereum Swarm is basically a giant DHT. DHTs are used in many storage solutions (like BitTorrent or IPFS) as a database where peers can find where the data is stored. Swarm uses the DHT in a different way because it stores the data itself in the DHT. Swarm calls this solution DISC which means Distributed Immutable Store for Chunks. When you store anything in Swarm, it splits it into 4K chunks. These chunks are addressable by the chunk hash and stored on nodes that are the nearest to the chunk address. Every chunk is stored redundantly on the 4 nearest nodes.\nThe network structure of Swarm is stable and highly optimized for the DHT. Because of this optimized network structure, the content retrieval in Swarm is really efficient. Swarm calls this Kademlia connectivity. If you need a more detailed explanation of the network structure, you can read about it in the Book of Swarm.\nSwarm is based on libp2p (underlay network), but nodes are addressed by an address that is derived from its Ethereum address (overlay network). The signature method is also the same that is used by Ethereum, and signatures can be easily validated by smart contracts. This makes Swarm an ideal storage solution for Ethereum.\nAnonymity is one of the key points of Swarm. Every node knows only a limited number of its neighbors because of Kademlia connectivity. If a chunk is not found on any neighbor they ask their neighbors, etc., and forward back the content. It\u2019s not possible to find out who is the requestor, and who is the source of the given chunk. Swarm calls this method forwarding Kademlia.\nBandwidth is a scarce resource in Swarm, because of this when you retrieve a chunk, you have to pay a small amount of BZZ (the native token of SWarm) for the retrieval. It is something like gas cost on the Ethereum network. If your neighbor has the chunk, it can keep the BZZ. If not, it has to pay one of its neighbors for it. This solution incentivizes the nodes to cache frequently asked contents and keep them near to the customers. It makes Swarm a really efficient CDN. (Swarm would be an ideal solution for decentralized multimedia streaming.)\nSwarm has a very interesting solution for accounting. It is something like Lightning Network, where microtransactions happen off-chain. In the case of Swarm, nodes keep track of a bandwidth balance. If a node gives and retrieves the same amount of chunks to another node, the balance will be near 0. If this balance goes over a limit, the node has to pay with a cheque.\nCheques are digitally signed data packs that can be collected by the nodes, and that can be used to withdraw BZZ tokens from the checkbook contract when it\u2019s worth it. This is Swarm\u2019s own gasless micropayment solution, but theoretically, it would be used for any cases where micropayment is needed.\nThere are two ways for storing data on Swarm. The first is global pinning. In this case, you store your data on your drive, and the DHT contains only a reference to it. It is very similar to the method used by IPFS to store data. It is free of charge because you store your own data, but not anonymous and you have to deal with the redundancy, etc. Another way of storage is using a postage stamp. A postage stamp is something like a cheque that can be used by the storage nodes to withdraw BZZ if they can prove that they storing your content. In this case, the content is stored in the correct place in the DHT, the source of the data is untrackable and the redundant storage is provided by the Swarm network.\nContent addressed chunks only one type of Swarm chunks. There is another type of chunk that is called Single Owner Chunk (SOC). In this case, the chunk key is a hash of the owner\u2019s Ethereum address and a chunk identifier. A SOC is valid only if it\u2019s signed by the owner. This type of chunk makes it possible to create a tricky data structure on Swarm that is called a feed.\nA feed is represented by a SOC where the identifier is hashed from a topic and a sequence number. A feed is a \u201cvirtually mutable\u201d data structure on immutable storage. When the owner wants to change the content of her feed, she increases the sequence number and publishes a new SOC. The Swarm client can heuristically find the highest sequence number, and pull the latest content. These mutable contents can be used in many ways. For example, you can assign it to your ENS address, and you can update the content without any blockchain interaction.\nAnother type of chunk is the trojan chunk. As I wrote at the beginning chunks are stored on the DHT on the nodes that are near to the chunk key by the node address (Ethereum address). This function of Swarm can be used to send direct messages to nodes. In this case, the message is packed into a chunk (this is the trojan chunk) and sent to the network. The network tries to store the chunk in the correct place, and nodes will forward it to the target node. The message is encoded, so only the target node will be able to read it. If the target node is offline, the neighbors will store it as a normal chunk if it has a postage stamp. Swarm has a high-level API to manage these trojan chunks, they called it PSS. PSS is something like an anonymous mail service that is a full-featured replacement of Ethereum\u2019s dead messaging service Whisper.\nAs you can see, Swarm is a really exciting storage solution, and much more. The unique features like Feeds, PSS messaging, and the micropayment system make it a complex ecosystem that can be used in many ways.\nAt the end of the article, I would say a big \u201cThank You!\u201d for Viktor (Tr\u00f3n) who patiently answered my questions and helped me to understand the basics of Swarm.\nThis article was originally posted on HackerNoon.", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 50, "created_time": 1645920852548, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Ethereum", "Swarm", "Blockchain", "Ipfs", "Decentralized Storage"]}, {"author": "Laura Rosell", "post_id": "d0c03067fa5", "user_id": "e6c074813ec1", "title": "Real Reasons I Lost Interest in Guys Who Had a Chance", "content": "Real Reasons I Lost Interest in Guys Who Had a Chance\nA handful of ways (not) to screw it up when she\u2019s already attracted\nPhoto by cottonbro from Pexels\nEver wonder why a woman pulled back when you could\u2019ve sworn she was interested? Well, I\u2019m here with some answers. Let\u2019s demystify this together.\nIf any of the following stories sound like something you\u2019ve done? Great!\u2026 because now that you\u2019re aware of a bad habit, you can fix it.\nIf not? Then you can breathe a sigh of relief and just remind yourself that love is also largely a matter of luck \u2014 and you\u2019re not doing something \u201cwrong\u201d to block that luck from coming your way.\nWatch, ponder, learn.\n1. The obvious red flags \u2014 lack of basic decency\nLet\u2019s start at the lowest bar. I\u2019ve been out with guys who suddenly said racist or misogynist things (including slut-shaming other women), and even one who tried to tell me that a recent, tragic, deadly accident wasn\u2019t sad. I\u2019ve also heard otherwise-attractive guys make mean remarks about children. And dishonesty? Yeah, that\u2019s a solid no from me \u2014 even if I have feelings involved.\nIf you can\u2019t consistently be tolerant, kind, and honest, you\u2019ll repel anyone who lives by said values: in other words, the best partners. So if you want to play in their leagues, you have to nurture those qualities. Obviously.\nOn the plus side, most people do have basic decency, so these red flags likely don\u2019t apply to you. See? You\u2019re already winning!\nLet\u2019s move on.\n2. Negging\nA (very good-looking) guy on a dating site once told me I \u201cused to be\u201d hot. I let that slide at first, thinking perhaps his words came out entirely wrong\u2026 but then he went digging through more of my photos and said he knew I could \u201cclean up nice\u201d for him if I wanted. That ended my interest in him: I knew he wouldn\u2019t have been chatting me up if he truly found me unappealing, so this meant he was just the kind of guy who enjoyed making women feel like shit. Ew.\nYou might think some negging is harmless. Truth is, all negging is very toxic territory. If it\u2019s a \u201cbig\u201d neg, it\u2019s cruel, and if it\u2019s a \u201clittle\u201d neg, it\u2019s still an attempt to seed insidious self-doubt and make a person feel insecure about the smallest things. Negging can even fall into the realm of emotional and psychological abuse \u2014 because trying to make someone doubt their very value is never okay.\nIf you sincerely feel a need to insult others as a means of connecting with them, see a counselor. Negging will diminish your options \u2014 or, at least, you\u2019ll only manage to woo people with rock-bottom self-esteem\u2026 and rock-bottom self-esteem doesn\u2019t make for healthy, happy, drama-free relationships. Friendly word of warning. So just don\u2019t.\n3. Clinginess and territoriality\nI once gave my number to a guy who started sending pointless texts along the lines of \u201cI\u2019m so bored in class.\u201d Somebody prone to codependency might\u2019ve thought, Aw, how cute, he wants to be in touch even when he should be doing other stuff! But women who aren\u2019t codependent? When a guy acts clingy, we think:\nDude. Everyone gets bored sometimes, but what are you, 6 years old? Why are you whining to me about something so trivial? Just deal with it, and reach out when you have something of substance to say.\nIf you frequently ping someone with nonsense check-ins rather than making attempts at quality communication, you\u2019ll look desperate, lonely, and needy \u2014 and lots of people will be turned off. Every connection needs space to breathe; otherwise it suffocates. Choose moments of quality connection instead of a constant barrage of vapid bids, and you\u2019ll be less likely to scare the person off.\nRelatedly, one guy \u2014 after just one date \u2014 left a post on my Facebook wall about looking forward to the next time we saw each other. He could\u2019ve said this privately (just like how all our previous exchanges were private), but he opted to publicly hint at a second date. Stunts like that reek of insecurity and control; they sound like: I want the competition to know you\u2019re spoken for so that they back off, because I don\u2019t trust you\u2019ll pick me otherwise.\nBehave in a way that demonstrates that you have a healthy sense of boundaries: that you won\u2019t expect the person\u2019s attention in all moments, that you won\u2019t expect them to attend to your every tiny emotional need (like being bored), that you respect their right to privacy, and that you don\u2019t feel entitled to \u201cclaim\u201d them before they\u2019ve even decided they want to be yours at all. Boundaries show respect, and respect is hot.\n4. Warning signs of substance abuse\nOne date I had was a lot of fun \u2014 until the guy told me he\u2019d recently broken a bone because he was so drunk that he fell (or was it jumped?) off a roof. Yikes. Intoxication to the point of majorly-impaired decision-making is generally a huge red flag, because it reveals that the person has an unhealthy relationship with substances. Moreover, the fact that he flashed his drunken-broken-arm story like a badge of pride showed me he was really not self-aware enough to realize he should get his drinking under control. Sayonara.\nUnhealthy relationships with substances correlate with unhealthy relationships with people. Why? Because there\u2019s deep emotional pain at the root of any substance abuse habit, and until that pain is addressed in a responsible way (not just glazed over with drugs or liquor), it continues wreaking havoc in your personal life. Healthy people don\u2019t want to be drawn into havoc, so signs of substance abuse scare us away.\nI\u2019ve known and loved a number of amazing people who struggled with addiction. If you struggle too, you\u2019re absolutely worthy of love. Just be aware that substance abuse makes good relationships very hard to maintain \u2014 so don\u2019t be surprised if people reject you.\nProfessional support can help you move forward into a happier, more fulfilling life chapter. Love will give you a chance once you do the work.\n5. Relegating me to booty-call status\nHere\u2019s a cautionary tale: one guy I dated for several weeks was smart, hot, (jaw-droppingly) well-endowed, good in bed, funny \u2014 the total package. He also showed sincere interest in me as a person. But after peacocking at the start of our fling about how he wanted daily sex, he proceeded only to see me about once a week\u2026 and sometimes not until 2:00am, when he\u2019d call to say he failed to woo anyone else at the bars that night. I let this slide for some weeks because I liked him and sensed he had some feelings for me that he needed time to sort out. But eventually I cut him loose. It was his prerogative to keep his options open, as we had no terms to the contrary. But it was also mine not to be a once-a-week backup lay.\nLo and behold, about a decade later, he reached out to say I was one of the Ones That Got Away and that he regretted this. My intuition about his feelings, in other words, was right\u2026 but he\u2019d razed his chances.\nMoral of this story: if you\u2019re really into someone, make an honest effort to see where things go. If you hold them at arm\u2019s length strictly on principle, you may lose them altogether. Treat a gem like the treasure it is.\n6. Flakiness\nEveryone has an \u201coff\u201d day and forgets to text, or ends up having to cancel because they accidentally double-booked. It happens sometimes. But if you routinely keep standing someone up or ghosting them, only to reach out and repeat the cycle all over? Some unresolved issue is posing serious obstacles to your happiness, and you deserve help with resolving it before it robs you still further.\nI went through this with a guy I was absolutely ENAMORED with. For well over a year, despite his flaking and ghosting, somehow I still loved him\u2026 until, abruptly, I didn\u2019t. By the time he processed what held him back (namely: pain from a former relationship), I was long gone. Luckily, he\u2019s happily married now \u2014 but only after spending half a decade under the weight of \u201cWhat if?\u201d and without somebody he wanted tremendously: me.\nDon\u2019t torture yourself like this. If you keep bailing on someone you really like, get a grip on your issues before they lose interest. If there\u2019s anything worth finding courage for, it\u2019s love.\n7. Guardedness\nOnce in a while, a guy who realizes he\u2019s screwed up big-time and wants to redeem himself will invite me to have some kind of deeper, \u201cgetting-to-know-you\u201d convo, only to act way. too. guarded. to actually connect once we get down to talking.\nMen have been fed a lie for a long time by the patriarchy that masculine \u201ccool\u201d is all about being aloof. But this is so very misguided and unhealthy\u2026 and therefore off-putting.\nConnection, by contrast, requires truth, sharing, and genuine courage. This is why healthy vulnerability is very hot.\nYou know what guardedness conveys? That you\u2019re afraid you\u2019ll get rejected if you show your real self\u2026 which, in turn, screams: \u201cMY REAL SELF IS UTTERLY UNLIKEABLE, TRUST ME!\u201d\nNot attractive. Here\u2019s the deal:\nIt\u2019s fine to \u201ctake it slow\u201d with opening up about some of the heavier stuff in your life, but if it\u2019s clear that you\u2019re being evasive when your love/sex interest asks you pointed questions about yourself \u2014 when they are trying to get to know you \u2014 then you are killinnnng your chances. If you want to connect, you HAVE to be real.\n8. Oversharing\nGuardedness is unsexy\u2026 but so is oversharing. Oversharing means sharing too much, too soon. Examples? The guys I hardly knew who unloaded everything from how guilty they felt that they pushed an ex to the point of addiction, to how much rage they carry about the abuse they experienced in childhood. I understand that some of us have complicated, intense stories. But a person who\u2019s genuinely done the work of processing their pain doesn\u2019t feel a need to dump it on the table immediately. Nor do they carry an aura of devastation or bitterness when they speak of it \u2014 not because they\u2019ve never felt those feelings, but rather because those emotions have been mostly neutralized by their healing process and the passage of time.\nThese people are ready for relationships.\nIf you\u2019re inclined to volunteer highly-charged heaps of detail to a person you hardly know, you risk giving the impression that you expect them to help you process it. Which can be a red flag for codependency.\nSo it\u2019s all about moderation:\nIt\u2019s great to be open when someone asks about your past in the spirit of getting to know you. It\u2019s also fine sometimes to volunteer info that feels important; you don\u2019t need to \u201cspeak only when spoken to.\u201d But it\u2019s not helpful to pour heaps of unpleasant emotion onto somebody you\u2019re not even with. Learn how to establish healthy boundaries around the emotional stuff you\u2019re working on \u2014 but also how to heal it so that it doesn\u2019t continue bleeding all over your connections in the now.\n9. A lack of internal spark\nHere I\u2019m referring to the guys who seem estranged from their souls. Disconnected from any sense of meaningful purpose or joie de vivre. Like guys who have no real interests or passions and are driven only by money. Or guys who are entirely unwilling to invest in anything but status. Different strokes for different folks, and I grant that some women prefer money and status themselves \u2014 but if you\u2019re looking for a partner of substance, they will expect you to have passions and hobbies that light a fire within you intellectually or emotionally, and they\u2019ll want you to value experiences over things.\nWhy are people with an internal spark more appealing? They\u2019re way easier to have meaningful conversations with, for one. But just as importantly, people who are in touch with their souls (define \u201csoul\u201d however you please) are the ones who can create \u201cfun\u201d from nothing, appreciate the little things, and sow joy in the quiet hours. Those are the best people to be around.\nSo if you want to light someone\u2019s fire, embrace your spark.\nNew to Medium? Sign up here!

Tell It Where to Meet You.\nSometimes, while we\u2019re waiting for a sign, life\u2019s waiting for us to decide.\nPhoto by Isaque Pereira from Pexels\nSix years ago, I was stuck. Hard. For the previous two-and-a-half years, I\u2019d tried out some international moves, never ultimately wrangling the job prospects, visas, income, or general fulfillment I\u2019d been aiming for. Now I was broke, in my early-30s, exhausted from all the fruitless effort \u2014 and resigned to the role of unwilling hermit\u2026 at my parents\u2019 house\u2026 with no car\u2026 in a rural town where I didn\u2019t know a soul.\nI saw no way out. Getting unstuck, going ANYWHERE else, would require resources I didn\u2019t have and therefore felt like a colossal risk.\nIn the past, \u201csigns\u201d from the cosmos had always helped me make big life decisions when I felt lost, and I desperately wanted some signs now. An inner voice was telling me to go back and give Berlin another try, but this felt preposterous to me, since Berlin had already not worked out before, and I was too clouded by fear and pessimism from previous failures to take big, self-directed chances anymore. Divine guidance would\u2019ve been mighty nice\u2026. but it wasn\u2019t forthcoming.\nInstead? After I quit hoping for signs and just decided to buy a ticket\u2026 that\u2019s when the signs commenced.\nAnd not just trite, generic ones, like the book titled Berlin Now that an aunt left for me in her guest bedroom one day (without her even knowing my plan). But also a surprise gift so loaded with symbolic validation of my ties to Berlin that it left me crying in wonder.\nI was still scared. I was still far from sure I was making the right choice. Where were these \u201csigns\u201d before I re-committed to Berlin? Were they just wishful thinking? I don\u2019t know. But here I am, still in Berlin, over five years later: despite all my reasons for having expected things to fail, they worked out. I have a coveted visa. A self-created job. An apartment in a neighborhood I love. Basically, I have the things that my prior efforts at making a life for myself abroad \u2014 yes, even my first move to Berlin \u2014 had refused to yield. Fate is funny; there really is such a thing as \u201cright opportunity, wrong time.\u201d\nYet if I\u2019d waited for cosmic hints and validations before following my shaky, trepidatious instincts\u2026 if I hadn\u2019t decided, \u201cScrew signs, I\u2019m giving it a try anyway\u201d \u2014 would I have any of this at all?\nSometimes we need to reach for the stars we hope to align.\nIt\u2019s a common saying that fortune favors the brave. For some people, \u201cfortune\u201d brings to mind thoughts of wealth and material security, but it always reminds me of the tarot deck: #10, the Wheel of Fortune, card of synchronicity and divine timing, of plot twists and the inevitable (\u2026which are sometimes one and the same).\nThe card speaks to destiny, in other words.\nDestiny isn\u2019t strictly a thing that happens to us. It\u2019s a current we often help direct through our choices. Unfortunately, though, sometimes we forget our role in that equation, so we end up stalling on the road of life, waiting forever to glimpse signposts and green lights that we can\u2019t possibly see unless and until we start moving.\nBack when I used to run a New Age advice blog, one of the most popular topics for questions from my audience was \u201csigns.\u201d People were forever asking me how to read things like strange coincidences, recurring imagery, dreams, and subtle-energy sensations. As a former literature major, I loved helping people decipher symbols from spirit. But while I\u2019m very much a believer in signs, I\u2019ve also seen that signs shouldn\u2019t be relied on blindly or waited for idly.\nFor instance, sometimes life sends you a shockingly inauspicious \u201csign\u201d regarding something that matters to you profoundly. If you just took that at face value, threw up your hands, and concluded, \u201cWell, I guess pain\u2019s my fate now\u201d \u2014 you\u2019d have a miserable life. You\u2019re not supposed to just throw in the towel on the deepest desires of your heart; you\u2019re supposed to figure out how very much you care about those things and be inspired take real action, so that the gut-wrenching disappointment of your \u201canti-sign\u201d doesn\u2019t need to become your reality. It\u2019s up to you to be brave and take that step, especially if the universe has so magnanimously warned you of the stakes.\nAlternatively, sometimes we\u2019ve gotten so many validating signs that we finally feel inspired and confident enough to act\u2026 but that\u2019s when we notice something disheartening: now that we\u2019ve all but taken the leap, the signs have stopped. Does the end of the signs mean we\u2019re too late? NO. It means they served their purpose; they guided us to the point where we finally decided we were ready to try. Kind of like how your GPS won\u2019t keep barking directions once you arrive at your destination, because why would it? Signs sometimes go quiet not because they\u2019ve grown irrelevant, but because they\u2019ve already successfully awoken us to the choice we want to make. So if this is you, don\u2019t say, \u201cWhen I see the next sign, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d Don\u2019t keep waiting for positive reinforcement. You\u2019ve already seen tons of signs. Shoot your shot. Find out.\nUltimately, regardless of whatever the signs are saying (or not), you can sometimes only know the real outcome by leaning into it.\nWouldn\u2019t you rather really put yourself out there and live your way into the result than wait forever for a green light to go seek your treasure? Living is the green light. And don\u2019t worry about stepping on the toes of fate, because here\u2019s the thing: even if you do choose the wrong time, or even if you choose the wrong \u201cdirection\u201d \u2014 you\u2019re not going to piss off the cosmos for having dared to take responsibility for your hopes, dreams, and wellbeing. As long as your heart\u2019s in the right place, something good will come of your effort, even if the outcome isn\u2019t exactly what you\u2019d hoped.\nThis is why you don\u2019t always need a plan, or even confidence. It truly can be enough (like with my Berlin 2.0 move) simply to say:\n\u201cI\u2019m super-lost right now, but I do know the last \u2018place\u2019 where I felt deeply inspired / safe / nurtured / valuable / loved / MYSELF\u2026 so I think I\u2019ll just head in that direction.\u201d\nYes. Choose inspired. Choose healthy. Choose peaceful. Choose loving and being loved. Choose being wholly, radiantly you. The universe loves that.\nMaybe there\u2019s an inevitability to certain things in our worlds, and that even if we don\u2019t act on them, life will eventually \u2014 no matter how dense we are about pursuing them \u2014 shove us in their direction. But time is precious. Would you rather, say, squander another six months waiting for a sign that you should move to that new city, or would you rather just go there and have those extra months for enjoying the place? Would you rather wait 20 years for life to reconnect you with that person you can\u2019t stop thinking about, or would you rather take a chance now, see if it works, and live those extra 20 years happier than any daydream? Would you rather \u2014 okay, you get the picture.\nYour wildest hopes are worth more than superstition. Are they, or are they not? They are. So stop watching idly for signs from the backseat; get up front and drive, and rest assured that in any possible scenario:\nthe signs are saying yes (and your heart is aligned with that message)\nthe signs are saying no (and you feel crushed, rather than empowered, by that message)\nor the signs are saying, weirdly, nothing at all\u2026\nthen the appropriate action is \u2014 all the same \u2014 to act on your heart. To move in the direction of your dreams.\nTo declare to the universe:\n\u201cEnough sitting still. I\u2019ve decided this is too important for me to keep waiting for a cosmic nudge or some kind of green light that might never appear, or might appear too late. Maybe the choice I\u2019m contemplating doesn\u2019t make much sense, or maybe the conditions aren\u2019t aligned, or maybe I\u2019m not actually ready for it, or maybe it wasn\u2019t meant for me anyway, and if it all crashes and burns, well, then it does\u2026 But I take seriously the gift of living. I take seriously my responsibility to build the kind of life I most want to have. And I take very seriously the chance to live this particular blessing. So I am going to try. At least I\u2019ll never have to look back and wonder \u2018what if only.\u2019 I\u2019ll be off now to make it happen. Care to join me, Universe? Then show up.\u201d\nBecause sometimes, life waits to give us what we want until the moment we\u2019ve grown enough to gather the courage and the willpower to reach for it. Until we\u2019ve grown enough to say all of this.\nSigns or no signs. Lucky stars or none at all.\nAnd that\u2019s when fortune turns her smile our way, the magic can finally commence, and the universe responds, with pride:\n\u201cAt. long. last.\u201d\nJoin Medium with my referral link - Laura Rosell\nAs a Medium member, a portion of your membership fee goes to writers you read, and you get full access to every story\u2026lmrosell.medium.com", "comment_count": 2, "like_count": 129, "created_time": 1649583765529, "comment": [{"user_id": "e6c074813ec1", "comment_time": 1649583765529, "comment": "Thank you for sharing!"}, {"user_id": "ccb86a0c63b1", "comment_time": 1649617960617, "comment": "If your heart is in the right place, you don't have to worry about which direction your feet are pointing."}, {"user_id": "26e61612d04", "comment_time": 1649664119402, "comment": "nailed it"}], "post_tag": ["Self", "Spirituality", "This Happened To Me", "Mindfulness", "Advice"]}, {"author": "Laura Rosell", "post_id": "61a7c6c6e023", "user_id": "e6c074813ec1", "title": "Here\u2019s How to Trust in Love Again After Abuse", "content": "Here\u2019s How to Trust in Love Again After Abuse\nThe secret? It\u2019s not actually about trusting love at all.\nPhoto by Ketut Subiyanto from Pexels\nA couple weeks ago, a friend asked me a profound question about relationships. He\u2019d been enamored for years of a guy who was stringing him along, playing mindgames, and just generally going out of his way to make him feel worthless\u2026 only then to make threats whenever my heartbroken friend said he needed to move on. FINALLY, my friend saw the truth: that his love interest was emotionally and psychologically abusive.\nWith the spell broken, now he was free to find genuinely good love. But he had a new problem: terror at the future possibility of spending years pining over yet another abusive guy.\n\u201cIt\u2019s so hard not to get bitter. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to think all men are shit now and close myself off from relationships. How did you ever trust in love again after abuse?\u201d he asked.\nHe knows my story. He knows I used to research abuse years ago in the ivory tower and that, while I haven\u2019t been with an abusive partner in well over a decade, the first 7 years of my relationship history were traumatizing. He also knows that I never lost faith in men \u2014 or love \u2014 at large. In other words, I\u2019ve remained safe even while keeping my heart open. What was the secret? How could he heal like that too?\n\u201cIf you really want to be safe,\u201d I told him, \u201cyou need to ask yourself why you put up with the abuse in the first place. Until you know that, you will always be vulnerable to it. But once you know? You never have to be afraid of getting sucked into an abusive relationship again.\u201d\nI\u2019ll explain.\nPeople who\u2019ve never been abused are often bewildered by how these relationships start. \u201cIf somebody was so horrible, why wouldn\u2019t you just leave them?\u201d The reality though is that the vast majority of abuse doesn\u2019t start with criminal-level misconduct. Not with assault, rape, theft, property damage, etc. (*Yes, a relationship \u2014 more like a hostage situation \u2014 can start like this, but it\u2019s far from the norm and not what we\u2019re talking about here.)\nMost relationship abuse instead starts subtle, with mindgames, negging, gaslighting, histrionic tantrums, stonewalling, silent treatment, etc. Thus, a victim is gradually goose-stepped through the emotional and psychological wringer into a dance of appeasement with their abuser \u2014 becoming desensitized to increasingly egregious behavior.\n\u2026 But this means that there are red flags all along.\nHence, the painful truth\u2026 Are you ready to face it?\nHere it is:\nWhile an abusive relationship might not start with someone doing something absolutely terrible to you, it does start by someone doing something plain-old bad to you \u2014 and you deciding to accept it. You can only avoid falling for an abuser if you are able and willing to see a red flag as a dealbreaker \u2014 and, accordingly, cut ties before your connection gains momentum.\nIf, however, you choose to be forgiving and patient with a person who tramples the boundaries of basic respect\u2026 then you effectively tell them their conduct is not a dealbreaker\u2026 and eventually (since abuse tends to escalate over time) the dynamic gets out of your control and crushes your self-worth so much that it\u2019s hard to leave.\nSo if you want to stop abuse in its tracks before your heart\u2019s invested, then you need to analyze why those early red flags didn\u2019t look like dealbreakers to you. Conveniently enough, there are really only two answers to this:\nYou thought it was justified (e.g., thought you deserved it)\u2026 or\nYou thought it was normal.\nThis is NOT to say you caused the abuse. Your abuser has full responsibility for their hurtful actions. But if you genuinely hope to stay safe going forward, you must compassionately acknowledge the part of you that saw any early red flags and decided to keep dating the person who waved them.\nGet curious about that part of yourself; it deserves extra self-love and attention \u2014 and once you heal it, it\u2019s going to be your ticket to real happiness\u2026 and safety.\nNeed a roadmap for this process? Start by searching your earliest memories of the abusive relationship(s) you\u2019ve had. Make a list of early incidents of this person exploding at you, insulting you, letting you down, or freezing you out. Because every one of those times, a part of you apparently decided that this was not a dealbreaker \u2014 and chose to continue the connection.\nNext, contemplate why you felt this way. Did you think you caused or earned that person\u2019s behavior, or that some other circumstance ought to excuse them for it? (Reason #1 above.) Or maybe you didn\u2019t even realize their behavior was a bad sign? (Reason #2.) Answer these questions honestly. Then chase each answer with \u201cwhy? why? why?\u201d until you\u2019ve hit your primordial \u201cwhy\u201d. (You might have several primordial \u201cwhy\u201ds.)\nHere\u2019s a real-life example: in my last abusive relationship, the very first red flag I remember from my ex Gonzalo (*name changed) was the time he exploded and then gave me the silent treatment without explanation, after which he told me that physical aggression had helped him deal with the anger I\u2019d inspired. In hindsight, this was a MAJOR clue that he was volatile, had toxic communication habits, and might even be dangerous. Yet I opted to apologize to him (what even for?) and try to reconcile. Thus our implicit terms were already drawn: that he was authorized to randomly explode, explain nothing, and even hint at violence, while it was my job to apologize and try harder to make him happy.\nIn hindsight, there were tons of red flags from the start; that much is painfully obvious now. But I either disregarded them or missed them altogether back then, for both of the above core reasons.\nOn the one hand (Reason #1), he was great at making me feel like all his anger was my fault \u2014 so I figured I must\u2019ve \u201cearned\u201d or \u201cdeserved\u201d it. Rather than see it as a dealbreaker, I saw him as gracious for the fact that he \u201cforgave\u201d me every time he got mad. On the other hand (Reason #2), I didn\u2019t see his conduct as too unusual: I\u2019d known lots of people through my early life who were prone to histrionics and/or stonewalling. Since none of those people were violent, I grew up believing such antics were \u201cnormal.\u201d In fact, I was so used to getting blamed for people feeling triggered out of the blue that I assumed this was just the effect I had on others. Hence, I was extremely unequipped to recognize Gonzalo\u2019s behaviors as toxic at all.\nThat\u2019s just my example. Everybody\u2019s specifics are different.\nThe bottom line is, people who think of red flags as justified or normal might very well fall for an abuser \u2014 but people with healthy self-concepts and healthy models of relating will be quickly turned off.\nSelf-limiting beliefs, whatever their cause, are what leave us vulnerable to abuse.\nLuckily, now you know how to find and fix yours.\nThe point in examining how you might\u2019ve enabled your own worst relationships is not to berate yourself or lose your tender heart. The point is to pinpoint your vulnerabilities so that you can tend to them compassionately and move forward with the full sense of your dignity and worth. If you can identify and heal the part of you that believed you should tolerate abuse, then you will value your own self-love more than the cheap facsimile of \u201clove\u201d that an abusive person proffers.\nAs you go through your healing process, you might be embarrassed about all the red flags you didn\u2019t catch. But don\u2019t feel ashamed for what you didn\u2019t recognize or know how to handle. It happens to the best of us. You weren\u2019t being a fool; you were just being sweet, good-natured, forgiving, and optimistic about love \u2014 and those are beautiful qualities. Never lose them. Instead, be proud of having kept your heart so open to love even amidst all that pain, and feel heartened by the fact that this older, wiser, stronger you can recognize and reject such people next time they come courting.\nSo. Next time a person puts out feelers for an abusive relationship by bringing you a red flag, don\u2019t let them bring it in your house. Because then they\u2019ll just bring you more and more until your house is brimming with them. Instead, just say, No thanks, I\u2019m not into red flags, bye \u2014 and an entirely different future will open up. Your house will remain red-flag free. And you\u2019ll never have to panic that the next love interest, or the next, or the next, will clutter your world with red flags.\nIt doesn\u2019t matter HOW many people bring those: you can send every one of them packing, while your heart remains entirely available for the kinds of people who don\u2019t bring red flags.\nAnd there are lots of people like that in this world. There are countless good ones.\nThis is why the moment(s) when you first allowed your basic self-respect to be challenged are your key to learning how to trust again. Because trusting in love is actually about trusting in you. Like the saying about the bird on the branch: the bird isn\u2019t scared because it trusts the branch. It isn\u2019t scared because it trusts its wings.\nThat\u2019s what it means to trust love. It doesn\u2019t mean you must trust that everyone who comes your way will treat you right. It means you trust your ability to screen out the ones who don\u2019t \u2014 so that only the good ones, who genuinely appreciate you and treat you like a treasure, get to stay.", "comment_count": 5, "like_count": 258, "created_time": 1648808427253, "comment": [{"user_id": "e6c074813ec1", "comment_time": 1648808427253, "comment": "Thank you for sharing!"}, {"user_id": "ccb86a0c63b1", "comment_time": 1649010078830, "comment": "Fabulous article!

How do you set the scene for the unseen? Does it begin when you\u2019re 23, and the \u201cghost\u201d starts coming to your room, filling the space with the warm spice of his cologne, and something in your gut tells you this is actually a living person \u2014 a man you\u2019ll meet someday, and that he\u2019ll be your love?\nOr does it begin two years later, when you proposition a practical stranger for a one-night stand on the eve of his move across the world\u2026 and you lay your lips on his neck, and breathe him in for the first time\u2026 and you\u2019re blindsided to realize you know his scent?\nI don\u2019t know. This story starts in a time outside of time, I guess. In the realm of the limitless. Or maybe it hasn\u2019t even \u201cstarted\u201d at all; maybe everything until now was just an epic, surrealist teaser.\nThis is why I struggle to tell it. Sure, I\u2019ve already told it the \u201cnormal\u201d way: I\u2019ve written about the feelings. Everybody understands those. But what I haven\u2019t shared fully yet \u2014 because who could possibly understand? \u2014 is the magic.\nThe magic, though, is the story.\nThe magic is the truth.\nI was 25 when I took him to bed. When I first caught the fragrance on his neck \u2014 once my mouth was on his skin, mid-hookup \u2014 I was in denial. I\u2019d handpicked the guy partly because his impending move to the other side of the planet seemed the perfect safeguard against romantic complication.\nBut of course I fell in love. Was there ever any other possibility?\nIt wasn\u2019t the cologne that did it. Despite all this talk of \u201cmagic,\u201d I\u2019m not that superstitious. I was a Ph.D. student then, entrenched in logic and reason. I wasn\u2019t given to romanticizing strangers. Still, all night in his presence, a resonance unlike anything I\u2019d ever known was subtly but inexorably imprinting itself on my heart. I remember the sense that I saw my own soul in his eyes. I remember the sense that I saw his soul within me. I remember a hundred other feelings nobody ever told me existed. There was a moment afterwards while we lay in one another\u2019s arms, face to face, that I think I suddenly knew it. I couldn\u2019t have put it into words; I didn\u2019t know what I knew yet. But I knew.\nBy the time I realized the word was \u201clove,\u201d he was already far away.\nExcept\u2026 on quiet nights alone in my room\u2026\u2026 he didn\u2019t always feel far. I\u2019d sense his spirit shimmer into the silence next to me, unmistakable. Usually right there on my bed, where our souls had worked their strange alchemy. Sometimes he lingered just a few moments. Other times, it felt like he stayed the whole evening. The essence of his spirit felt so real that I almost imagined I could reach out and touch him. Like if I closed my eyes, I\u2019d re-open them to find he returned, or that he\u2019d never left at all: that our moment never truly ended, and if I glanced over to where I felt the warmth of his soul, I\u2019d see him grinning, like a king against my mountain of pillows, and all the time that lapsed since our parting would dissolve like a crazy dream\u2026 and now that I knew who he was to me, I could do what I should\u2019ve done that first night. I could tell him:\n\u201cI love you.\u201d\nOr:\n\u201cStay.\u201d\nOr, better still:\n\u201cLet\u2019s go together. I want this adventure with you.\u201d\nBut I couldn\u2019t.\nBecause I, from the moment he walked out my door\u2026 had been ghosted. (Ah, what a word\u2026)\nSo on those nights, I\u2019d simply offer a prayer of gratitude for the strange chance to rest again in his light. And I\u2019d smile, curl up in the invisible embrace\u2026 and drift into dreams.\nIn the research world, there\u2019s a term called \u201cstatistical significance.\u201d It basically refers to the question:\n\u201cHow likely is what I\u2019m perceiving all just a coincidence?\u201d\nAs a fledgling academic, I was well acquainted with this question, and I applied it ruthlessly to my life in the early days after he left; fairly immediately, my world had exploded with uncanny coincidences too numerous to ignore. I tried chalking them up to selective attention, and the \u201cvisitations\u201d to wish fulfillment. Yet even while my demographer friends and my therapist marveled that these weren\u2019t garden-variety \u201ccoincidences\u201d and that I was indeed sane, NOBODY I knew \u2014 not even the long-term, happily-married couples \u2014 could relate to this sense of sharing a soul with someone. Feeling their presence when they\u2019re many miles away. Watching the cosmos throw an endless festival of synchronicity in their name. The only remotely-relatable framework I found to help make sense of my new reality was, thus \u2014 weirdly \u2014 mystic poetry and (weirder still) Christian love songs.\nOdes to divine love, in other words.\nAnd when you\u2019re dealing with the divine, the barriers of space, time, logic, and causality\u2026 are moot.\nSuch as\u2026 the time I was visiting a qi gong healer in Manhattan: I felt his soul show up SO unexpectedly mid-appointment that I got startled \u2014 and then the healer suddenly opened her mouth and incanted his name, like a prayer.\nOr that time years later, now in Shanghai: at the blissed-out end of a reiki session, I fell into such a vivid vision of our night together that I felt I was practically reliving it\u2026 until he abruptly deviated from script by opening his mouth to say \u2014 sweetly, metaphorically \u2014 \u201cI gave you a map.\u201d I dismissed this as a daydream until, hours later, back at the healer\u2019s villa for a mixer, some random woman turned to me and thrust into my hands\u2026 a print of an antique map.\nThe surreal became the norm with respect to him, as if the universe were forever assuring me:\nWhen you feel him, he\u2019s really there.\nI didn\u2019t want to cling to his memory. But at the same time, these \u201chello\u201ds from his spirit felt so pure and loving that I didn\u2019t mind. So when I noticed that his energy seemed especially likely to show up when I played a particular instrumental track, I made a point of meditating to it on occasion.\nThe song \u2014 remember this \u2014 was called \u201cLotus.\u201d\nThe larger story of this connection spans more than a decade. (Frankly, I sense, more than this life.) After years of ghosting me, he did break his silence \u2014 thanks to an insane \u201ccoincidence\u201d that linked us again from thousands of miles apart \u2014 and we became something like friendly acquaintances. We even had brief, friendly chats in person, when chance ordained and geography allowed.\nBut we never talked about us. I never asked him why he\u2019d stood me up and ghosted me after that very first night, and I, meanwhile, felt too self-conscious about the mystic that life had made of me in his wake to tell him about the trippy things. If I shared all the magic that marked our bond from the start, would he be unsettled? I didn\u2019t want to scare him. I didn\u2019t want, either, for him to misunderstand and think I was obsessed. Much less \u2014 if he did believe me \u2014 for him to conclude that he had to love me, by divine mandate.\nI held his free will as sacrosanct. I respected his choice not to choose me.\nSo I locked down the vault of stories. Of every time his memory helped to fortify, heal, or save me. Every time his essence lit up my soul\u2019s darkest nights. Every life-affirming truth this love taught me about anything worth knowing. I treated all the magic as if it were some contagious affliction \u2014 a thing I \u201ccaught\u201d by falling in love \u2014 and it were my responsibility to keep it politely contained, lest it break TOTALLY loose and disrupt his world with too much cosmic exuberance.\nWhich is why, even when he came to me once to ask about a dream he\u2019d had \u2014 a sex dream that felt more like a memory, uncannily vivid, as if he\u2019d stepped back in time and actually been with this partner again \u2014 the most I dared tell him about the magic between souls was:\nSometimes souls can visit each other.\nBut I didn\u2019t tell him his soul taught me this.\nEven a long time later, when he confided that his hyper-real dream had been of me (I was unsurprised, since I\u2019d dreamed of him that night too \u2014 and awoken on the brink of climax)\u2026 I didn\u2019t tell him his soul was always visiting my bed.\n(How do you explain what you don\u2019t understand?)\nI did tell him, once, that I fell in love with him. And he responded that he\u2019d wished many times along the years that we could be together again\u2026 but now he was with someone else.\nAnd the years passed. And we fell largely out of touch. And I did my best to put the memory of all that strange magic behind me. Live a normal life. Find a normal love.\nEven if I did still feel him once in a while. Did still have dreams that felt too real to be dreams. Did still, occasionally, catch the cosmos whispering to me of him, anywhere in the world I went.\nI don\u2019t know where along the years I stopped listening to \u201cLotus.\u201d\nA couple weeks ago, here in Berlin, I got sucked into a clusterfuck of a group chat. I was excited: my friends were trying to arrange a spontaneous dinner, and one of the invitees was a guy I wanted to get to know. I was feeling tons of creative life force energy that week. I\u2019d just frozen some eggs. I\u2019d just completed a major milestone in the writing of my memoir. It felt like a fertile time for something new.\nWhile my friends struggled to make up their minds \u2014 should we get dinner, shouldn\u2019t we, where should we, but what about covid, let\u2019s do Indian food \u2014 eventually, one of them tossed out the very first concrete restaurant suggestion of the whole debacle. With needlessly over-enthusiastic punctuation. At 5:39pm:\n\u201cLotus?!?\u201d\nAnd then.\nPromptly.\nAt 5:40.\nOut of nowhere.\nFor the first time in over half a decade\u2026\nTHE guy initiated a conversation with me.\nI stared at my screen dumbstruck.\nWhere in the world am I, how am I doing, he\u2019d love to hear more about the book I\u2019m writing (ohhhh, but would you now?\u2026)\u2026 and by the way, he had another dream of us. Again, back in our moment. Again, on my old bed. But this latest dream also abruptly segued to a different memory: the two of us chatting at a Starbucks years ago.\nLittle did he know, I had just written the Starbucks scene not long before.\nSo when our chat ended, I was curious to review my latest memoir chapters. Specifically, I wanted to see how I\u2019d ended them. What I\u2019d said about him. But when I opened the file, it didn\u2019t open to the last chapter. It opened to a passage that began, right beneath the cursor:\nOne day, I receive a message from him:\n\u201cHey, I wanna ask you about dreams.\u201d\nOnly at the end of the night did I realize his strange, unwitting timing with mere mention of the word \u201cLotus.\u201d\nIn conversations years apart, he inevitably references the trippiness of Murakami novels when he describes these dreams where we connect. As if only the world of the surreal could explain what he\u2019s lived. Most people don\u2019t read Murakami and think, Hm, yes, sounds relatable.\nBut I do. Because of him.\nSo I decided to tell him some of the trippy stuff. For the very first time.\nIn some ways, the \u201cBig Bang\u201d of my universe has never ended. I could never say all my life\u2019s magic or even all of its magical soul connections have been limited to this man. There\u2019s so much more to my story. But does it somehow all link back to him? To that night and whatever our souls happen to be to one another?\nWithout a doubt. Yes.\nWho in the invisible designs a connection like this? What is it for? What does it mean when two souls, across so many years, keep finding their way back to the moment when they fused? When the sense of actually being there with each other, even from afar, feels almost palpable? When they both, in searching for words to describe this strange bond, inevitably invoke surrealist literature, as if the only template for whatever they are exists in the realm of make-believe?\nFor that matter, what\u2019s the direction of causality here? Did I feel him along the years because he was actually there, or was he there because I felt him? Is it all the magic that created all the love, or is it the love that created all this magic?\nBetween love and magic, is there really a difference at all?\nAnd what do you do \u2014 the artist in me begs to know \u2014 with a magic you don\u2019t understand? Do you lock it up until you can figure it all out, because you\u2019ve learned from experience that it\u2019s potent enough to rewrite your whole world? Or do you just give it free roam and let it show you where it wants to go, teach you what you need to know?\nWhat do you do when your muse is a practical stranger, but you feel like your souls have known each other since a time outside of time?\nMaybe\u2026 you just stop waiting for it to make sense. You stop worrying about sounding crazy. Maybe silencing your life\u2019s holiest mysteries is not the point of living them. It\u2019s taken me years, but I\u2019ve finally come to suspect that the things we hold most sacred are the only truly sustainable things in this life, and until we take them out of their tabernacle and hold them up in the light of day for everyone to be fed by\u2026 we will all go hungry.\nSo maybe you lean in, at last, to all the magic. Even if you can\u2019t understand where it comes from, or where it\u2019s going, or why it chose you, or what it means, or what it\u2019s for, or whether your words could ever possibly do justice to something so sacred\u2026 and you just write it down.\nJoin Medium with my referral link - Laura Rosell\nAs a Medium member, a portion of your membership fee goes to writers you read, and you get full access to every story\u2026lmrosell.medium.com", "comment_count": 4, "like_count": 282, "created_time": 1647471531845, "comment": [{"user_id": "e6c074813ec1", "comment_time": 1647471531845, "comment": "Thank you for sharing!"}, {"user_id": "ef5c37962be8", "comment_time": 1647771660771, "comment": "I know who this is \u2026 this is your TwinFlame.

It\u2019s likely it was done to inspire another round of articles and responses, like this one. Most of the segment just saw him quoting his critics and calling them fat nerds who don\u2019t get laid. Not found in this editorial, unlike the few that make decent arguments, is any kind of real argument. He thinks comics are for kids and fuck you if you think otherwise. He does make one attempt to cite some kind of evidence to support his claim, but it\u2019s just factually incorrect. He also doesn\u2019t realize that rather than kids\u2019 stuff, comic books are the best thing on the market to compete with the thing he hates most: religion.\nIn the segment (video embedded below), Maher reads the response to his original comments from Stan Lee\u2019s POW! Entertainment. In the polite missive, the writers point out that Maher did, in fact, insult Stan Lee. They also make the case that comic books are literature. Then they wrote:\n\u201c\u2026[Y]ou have a right to your opinion that comics are childish and unsophisticated. Many said the same about Dickens, Steinbeck, Melville and even Shakespeare.\u201d\nMaher\u2019s response to this was to mock them for being so hilariously wrong, which they would know if they \u201cever read a book without pictures.\u201d Of course, Maher is the one who couldn\u2019t be more wrong. Melville faced heavy criticism throughout his career. His contemporary critics called his work \u201chodgepodge,\u201d \u201cmonstrous,\u201d \u201cbizarre,\u201d \u201cfanciful,\u201d and all other era-appropriate terms for both \u201cchildish\u201d and \u201cunsophisticated.\u201d Dickens also faced such criticisms. Some of his peers, like Thackeray, loved his work. Many others hated it. They suggested his themes were simplistic, his style was clunky, and that he was a sellout. Shakespeare also caught some of this heat from his fellows and even after. He wasn\u2019t even really appreciated until about the 17th Century. (There\u2019s also a fringe collection of academics who think Shakespeare didn\u2019t write his plays.) He caught flak both from his contemporaries, like Robert Green, and from objectively great writers throughout the subsequent centuries.\nWhat all three of those writers share, and Stan Lee as well, is that their work was loved and consumed by the \u201cmasses.\u201d Maher, who famously called the majority of Americans \u201cstupid\u201d ten years ago, doesn\u2019t even bother to do any criticial thinking here. If a lot of people love comic books and movies based on them, then it must be for dumb-dumbs and toddlers. He clumsily makes this connection by showing a few social media posts tagged with \u201c#adulting.\u201d These are meant to serve as examples that the younger generation is just a bunch of widdle babies. To do a pun bit from his rant better than he did: Apparently when Baby Boomer comedians get into their 60s, they are at an increased risk of irony deficiency. Maybe some people use that word/hashtag unironically, but the posts he showcased were obviously not sincere.\nThroughout the rest of the bit, Maher inflicts relentless immaturity jokes on his audience. Yet, if Maher could resist his urge to pounce with rage and cruelty at his critics (like a certain President), he might have realized something important. For much of the past 20 years, Maher\u2019s biggest cause celebre has been how damaging organized religion is to society. Perhaps if Maher read a book with pictures in it (specifically the works of Joseph Campbell), he\u2019d realize that myth and religion are as human a need as cohabitation, laws, and everything else related to how society and culture is born. Religion isn\u2019t going anywhere, because human beings need fantastical morality tales that give them something to believe in and be passionate about.\nThe world of superheroes and villains is no different than religion in that respect. These are tales of \u201cgods\u201d and \u201cmonsters\u201d who have conflict, and that conflict is usually an allegory for some higher truth. You would think that someone who thinks America is full of, like, 329 million dipshits would appreciate a medium that reinforces the simple values we might forget.\nJust to name a few:\nBeing different doesn\u2019t make someone bad.\nHelp others when they need it.\nTeamwork is good.\nAvoid killing people.\nThese are simple, important concepts. Comics can be a kid\u2019s first exposure to these ideas (outside of their parents\u2019 influence). They also can be like a booster shot for those values when the audience is adults. The stories can also start new discussions about things like the balance between liberty and security. The figures in these films can serve as cautionary examples, especially when it comes to how a seemingly \u201cgood\u201d person can actually be quite evil.\nMarvel\u2019s Black Panther presented their most fully-realized movie villain in Killmonger, played by Michael B. Jordan. His motivations were complex and compelling, leading some fans to take to social media using another dreaded hashtag: #KillmongerWasRight. Only, it never failed that some fans (including your humble correspondent) would challenge that idea. In the film, Killmonger gains the same powers as the titular hero. He says his goal is liberate Black America from the yoke of White Supremacy. Even though he\u2019s a thief and a murderer, the audience can empathize with his point-of-view. Yet, instead of creating a \u201cBlack Panther\u201d for every neighborhood, he destroys the source of that power, so no one can challenge his authority. Not only did this bit of Spring-movie fluff offer an allegory for populist authoritarianism, it got people talking and thinking about it. Not bad for kids\u2019 stuff, and it\u2019s a very relevant tale to both the left and right in America today.\nAll of these movies offer the kind of values and morality one finds in religious stories, as well as warnings about hubris, carelessness, and even lessons about conflict resolution among friends. Yet, unlike religion, they don\u2019t pretend that it\u2019s a documentary. People go into these stories knowing that they are fiction, but the effect they have is the same. They can look to these movies for inspiration or comfort when the real world fails them (again). These stories can move us in any number of ways. For Maher, third lead in the film Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death, that\u2019s not enough. No, for it to be the kind of art or literature that\u2019s \u201cworthy\u201d it can\u2019t be something that\u2019s both easily accessible and makes people feel good.\nWe are in a strange time for media. As a former political correspondent myself, I know that to survive in this media landscape, you have to keep your audience outraged to keep them coming back. Maher doesn\u2019t care if they are outraged with him or at him, only that they are talking about him. This seems to be his focus, at least since Ben Affleck lost his shit on Maher and Sam Harris some years ago. Since then, he\u2019s gotten lazy. It\u2019s easy to get people angry at you or someone else. It\u2019s much more difficult to think about something in a new way, including considering that his point-of-view isn\u2019t exactly correct. Ironically, the very modern myths he\u2019s deriding could perhaps help him understand that a bit better. Comic book stories offer people the kind of tales we\u2019ve loved for millennia. If our reckless, wonderful, ridiculous species survives even another few centuries, there is no question that Spider-Man, Superman, and many others will adorn the ancient literature shelves with Tolkien, Homer, and Milton.\nWatch the rant for yourself below:\n", "comment_count": 9, "like_count": 420, "created_time": 1548484592432, "comment": [{"user_id": "3c3b93e75ed6", "comment_time": 1548484592432, "comment": "Thank you for sharing!"}, {"user_id": "57a36d36016d", "comment_time": 1548866905202, "comment": "Maher\u2019s argument is fatally grounded in ignorance, but I do understand his reasoning."}, {"user_id": "555491e1e445", "comment_time": 1549310481741, "comment": "My guess is his mommy didn\u2019t let him have comics as a kid so he\u2019s angry."}, {"user_id": "75e78d166b50", "comment_time": 1549575529408, "comment": "Greek myths, 2.0"}, {"user_id": "d755f6beb6ca", "comment_time": 1548897526866, "comment": "Attacking Stan Lee the man is weak.

Instead, it\u2019s the start of the most ambitious serial cinema storytelling endeavor of all time.\nImage via Marvel Studios\nSome years ago, when I was revisiting the Marvel Studios films in advance of Avengers: Endgame, I wrote about how 2012\u2019s Avengers defied all of my expectations. On the 10th anniversary of this film\u2019s release, the mythos around this film has changed (mostly because of behind-the-scenes revelations) but its impact remains the same. This was the movie that proved beyond all shadow of a doubt that the newly minted Marvel Studios was able to bring to the big screen the formula that worked so long for them in the comics. No, I\u2019m not talking about telling stories about superhumans that bring them down-to-Earth with relatable problems but rather making the large world of Marvel heroes feel real and lived in. Even more so, it showed that the studio could successfully sell this shared universe idea to audiences without sacrificing big box office returns. If the cameos at the end Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk were the proof-of-concept, Avengers was the prototype for the modern MCU.\nIn the past 10 years, Marvel Studios has gone from a risky proposition for a constantly struggling comic book company to one of the surest bets for blockbuster success. They have had massive hits and ambitious disappointments (read: Eternals) that still are bold and dynamic films. Their next film, due out this weekend, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is another big, weird comic book movie that requires audiences to not just understand 20 years of Marvel movie history but also how the rights in the film business work. (Specifically, the inclusion of Patrick Stewart\u2019s Charles Xavier from the X-Men films which casual moviegoers may not understand is a different \u201creality\u201d from the main MCU.) However, when looking specifically at the legacy of Avengers there is no way to discuss it without at least mentioning the writer and director\u2019s fall from grace.\nJoss Whedon, who left Marvel to helm the most reviled DC film perhaps of all time Justice League, is no longer the massive franchise builder he once was. Reports of his mistreatment of actors on sets from Justice League dating all the way back to Buffy, forced all genre fans who enjoyed his work to do some reevaluating. Is he the wonderkid (all due respect to Ted Lasso\u2019s Nate) that we all thought? The answer is: not really. Yet, for me, the realization that Whedon is something of a one-trick pony crystalized for me when I watched Zack Snyder\u2019s Justice League for the first time. I had been able to correctly identify every addition made by Whedon in the theatrical cut. The line between \u201cauthorial voice\u201d and \u201chack\u201d became very blurry. (Though, in fairness, my favorite moment in both versions of the Justice League movie was Whedon\u2019s: Batman\u2019s \u201cjust save one\u201d speech to the Flash was peak comic book goodness.)\nStill, to keep the focus on the subject at hand, the distinct style of Whedon as a writer and director is as evident in this movie as any other project of his. Yet, save for perhaps Firefly, the Whedon style never worked better than it did in Avengers. His no-frills shorthand for establishing character relationships through dialogue, capability of handling conceptual sci-fi, and talent for inserting comedic beats during high-stakes moments all contributed to making this film work. This movie had to do a lot of \u201cwork\u201d to get the characters together and believably create the circumstances for their team-up. Maybe the film succeeded in spite of Whedon, especially when comparing this one to Avengers: Age of Ultron. While he sounds like a nightmare of a man to work for, Whedon was able to assemble a cast and crew of creatives who all delivered on what they were supposed to do.\nFor me, this film is inseparable from when it came out and what it signified for the larger MCU. The love I have for it is as much about that moment in the theater when it was over that I first knew Marvel Studios was going to succeed in their endeavor. When they first began, the Marvel film operation seemed like a desperate last-ditch gamble by a company that optioned away the rights to its biggest characters to use the B-Team to catch the dying wave of superhero blockbusters in cinema. By the time audiences saw the Avengers wordlessly eating \u201cthe best Schwarma in New York City,\u201d they were the studio who would keep superheroes in pop culture forever. Avengers marked the moment that Stan Lee\u2019s legion of True Believers recognized that their faith was not in vain.\nThe law of averages suggests that Marvel Studios will eventually fall from grace leading to what will inevitably result in a reboot of the entire MCU. Maybe they will again defy the odds, maybe they won\u2019t. No matter what happens going forward, the achievement that started with Avengers and culminated in Avengers: Endgame is one that transcends simple storytelling or box office earnings. The new American mythology born in the pages of comic books throughout the past 50 years was brought to life. Just 20 years before the debut of this film, comic book fans often had to keep their fandom to themselves. Comic book stories were not for popular folks nor a respected artistic medium. Today, they are the cornerstone of pop culture and, as the box office returns for Spider-Man: No Way Home and The Batman show, potentially the savior of the movie theater industry. There are countless places where the modern comic book movie revolution began, but Avengers was the final beginning. They\u2019d arrived and they were burdened with glorious purpose.\nWhether or not the movie as a story \u201cholds up\u201d is a matter of taste, and one that the kids who find it on Disney+ buried in the rest of the Marvel offerings to decide. But for those of us who were there, Avengers was special. The story worked, the movie did too, and the rest is history.", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 0, "created_time": 1651687230306, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Avengers", "Marvel Studios", "Mcu", "Movies", "Marvel"]}, {"author": "Joshua M.

It had been a few years since the last of the \u201cNext Generation\u201d series went off the air. (The criminally underrated Enterprise, or the one with that theme song.) Since then, we\u2019ve gotten a lot of Star Treks: Discovery, Picard, Lower Decks, Prodigy, and Short Treks. These series tell different sorts of stories, strike different tones, and have made Star Trek a fresher and more diverse franchise than ever. Yet, with Star Trek: Strange New Worlds, we are all finally getting the show we wanted. A bunch of pretty people on the USS Enterprise exploring space week to week, getting into scrapes, being brave, and giving speeches. Looking to the stars and making the folks at home feel like the future is bright and exciting.\nAkiva Goldsman and company have finally cracked the code to how to do that given the tumultuous state of Trek fandom at the moment. Fans of things with \u201cStar\u201d in the name usually can always find something to complain about. That said, Strange New Worlds feels like it could be a phenomenon from back in the 1990s glory days. While this could be said about all of the new Trek installments, this is a series that truly is for the hardcore fans and someone who\u2019s never seen a Star anything before.\nBoth Picard and Discovery are heavily serialized shows. Sure, they have a \u201cmission of the week\u201d in each episode, but almost all of it is tied to a larger story arc. Strange New Worlds has these elements, but they are tied to characters. Like the animated series over at Star Wars, longtime fans enter this story knowing everyone\u2019s fate. Even the new characters. Well, at least, we know where they weren\u2019t once James T. Kirk captained the Enterprise. What happened is already foretold, right? So, how or why it happened becomes the more interesting story to the audience.\nCelia Gooding as Uhura of the Paramount+ original series STAR TREK: STRANGE NEW WORLDS.

Taking the baton from Zoe Saladana, she plays Nyota Uhura, at this point a cadet assigned to the Enterprise. She also has the daunting task of acting in the shadow of Nichelle Nichols, who was so important to Star Trek, even Martin Luther King, Jr. noticed. Gooding\u2019s Uhura is closer to Saldana\u2019s in that we meet her before she is the competent communications officer that she is in Star Trek: The Original Series. Yet, this Uhura is still facing a crisis of faith that we\u2019ve not seen in the character before. Again, we know where she ends up. How she gets there is what interests me as a longtime fan. Yet, the show is also perfectly acceptable to viewers who might say something like: \u201cOh no, I sure hope Uhura stays on the Enterprise!\u201d\nEthan Peck is back as Spock, and the events of Star Trek: Discovery are not discounted. Yet, for folks who found themselves unable to connect with that story, the first few episodes tell you all you really need to know about it to enjoy Strange New Worlds. Arguably, he has the most difficult job of anyone on the cast. So much so that when Pittsburgh native Zachary Quinto took on the role, Abrams was kind enough to let Leonard Nimoy be an older version of the character in the movie. Peck not only had to navigate the inseparability of Nimoy with this character, but also the big canon addition that Sonequa Martin-Green\u2019s Michael Burnham was his foster sister. I admit to even sighing a little at that myself, just because it gives off \u201csmall world galaxy\u201d vibes. But, Peck and Martin-Green turned me into a believer. With this, Spock\u2019s desire to be more Vulcan than Human takes on a deeper, more tragic subtext.\nAnother character who appeared with Peck both on Discovery and in a Short Treks episode is Rebecca Romijn as Number One, Magel Barrett\u2019s character from the unaired Star Trek pilot (later repurposed as \u201cThe Cage\u201d). The original series we got does seem preferable to the first version. Yet, Barrett\u2019s relegation to Nurse Chapel rather than second-in-command feels like a loss. So, it\u2019s great that Romijn gets to give this character her due. (Also, I think they are somehow using the late Barrett\u2019s voice as the Enterprise computer, and while it may be ghoulish it warms this Trekkie\u2019s heart just to hear her again.)\nStill, Una \u2014 a very clever name for Number One \u2014 is a fascinating character. The series expands the Star Trek lore with her in a big way. While she looks like just another human member of the crew, her appearance may be deceiving. Yet, as established in Discovery, both Captain Pike and Spock are very loyal to her and she to them. In fact, the premise of the pilot episode involves Number One caught in a cage and needing rescued.\nJess Bush as Chapel and Babs Olusanmokun as M\u2019Benga of the Paramount+ original series STAR TREK: STRANGE NEW WORLDS.

All Rights Reserved.\nStrange New Worlds also brings back a Star Trek: The Original Series character in Dr. M\u2019benga, originally played by Booker Bradshaw. Perhaps most famously known for slapping the dog spit out of Spock in the second season episode \u201cA Private Little War,\u201d to snap him out of his \u201cVulcan healing state.\u201d The character appeared in other episodes, including an unproduced script that dove into his backstory as a man from Uganda with a brother serving as First Officer on another vessel. Babs Olusanmokun will take the baton from Bradshaw, bringing this character to life again as the Chief Medical Officer on the Enterprise. Now, some fans might wonder why Dr. M\u2019Benga would still be on the Enterprise after Leonard McCoy is named CMO under Kirk, but this series offers an interesting character detail that could explain that. Yet, in the timeline of the series, we\u2019re at least five years out from Kirk\u2019s command, so it will take some time for this particular issue to be resolved.\nAnson Mount, who\u2019s last attempt at the world of franchises was the ill-fated Inhumans TV series Marvel Studios would rather we forget. While that show did have its issues, Mount was not one of them. In fact, he faced the added challenge of having to play a leader who could not speak. When he showed up on Discovery as Pike, it was just the energy that show needed. One thing some Trek die-hards might say is that he\u2019s a bit too much like Kirk. Yet, the differences are as plentiful as the similarities, and Pike\u2019s role in the now-expanded Star Trek franchise is to serve as a kind of proto-Kirk.\nPike is a fantastic Captain, but he doesn\u2019t really seem to do much other than care a great deal about his crew. There are a lot of strong characters, all who get their moments in the sun (sometimes literally). Also, Pike was very heroic in Discovery, as Burnham\u2019s ally in trying to save Spock that season. Lastly, the idea that Pike is a hero is not ever in question. A big part of his arc relies on it, in fact. Still, I\u2019d like to see the Captain come to the rescue of his crew, just because it sells the notion that these people are loyal enough to him to face certain death. Yet, in these first episodes the storytellers want to give the rest of the crew time to shine.\nMount\u2019s performance is such that, even as a die-hard who respects the idea of \u201ccanon\u201d story events, I hope this version of him gets to cheat the fate that awaits him in \u201cThe Cage.\u201d Yet, even if it doesn\u2019t, it means we could have (at least) 10 or so seasons of this series, and I\u2019d take every second of it. That both we (and the character himself) knows his ultimate fate obviously adds a new layer of pathos. In fact, one might expect that like the other Paramount+ Star Trek series, Strange New Worlds would lean into that heavy drama. Instead, it enriches our understanding of the character when he seems to be having fun in very not-fun situations. Shore leave or meetings, life-or-death battle or sci-fi hijinks, Pike gets exhilaration from feeling alive. Kirk and the other Captains were hopeful because, well, they are Star Trek captains. Pike is hopeful and inspiring in spite of, technically, having no real hope. This show takes the classic Star Trek formula, and upgrades it from all sides.\nRebecca Romijn as Una, Anson Mount as Pike and Ethan Peck as Spock of the Paramount+ original series STAR TREK: STRANGE NEW WORLDS.

All Rights Reserved.\nThe show Ted Lasso surprised me in a lot of ways, but mostly because it challenged a long-held belief I had about fiction and drama. Basically, that if you have a bunch of characters who are all just nice to each other, there is very little interesting drama. Strange New Worlds has that same quality, just in an action-adventure space exploration show. There is interpersonal tension in the crew and constant threats from boldly going where no one has gone before. Yet, this crew feels like a real crew. There is one exchange during a very fierce conflict episode between Pike and Spock that does more to establish their mutual respect and friendship than the entirety of Star Trek (2009). It\u2019s a truly classic exchange up there with \u201cThe needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.\u201d & \u201cOr the one.\u201d It doesn\u2019t just feel like Star Trek, Strange New Worlds is unmistakably what people think of when they think of this franchise.\nTo be completely clear, Star Trek: Discovery and Star Trek: Picard are also hopeful and satisfying shows. They tell ambitious, complicated stories with sci-fi and metaphysical concepts used as allegory to directly reflect real-world sociopolitical issues. They are also stories focused intensely on the characters and their growth, meaning they constantly change. Where you could probably watch Star Trek: The Original Series in any order and still understand it, these new series aren\u2019t that. And that\u2019s good. Telling epic stories like this are exactly what Star Trek is for, and a service like Paramount+ is the perfect place to do it. They don\u2019t have to fight for ratings week-by-week nor deal with the tight production times (or budgets) of the Trek shows of old. When Strange New Worlds finishes its third season, all of a sudden, you\u2019ll be seeing Trekkies and critics circle back around and realize what a dynamic gift these shows have been. They are hopeful stories, and in them the characters must fight and suffer to find it.\nThe thing that makes Strange New Worlds different and a bit of a relief is that neither character nor viewer has to fight too hard to find the hope in it. They wear it on their sleeves like the Trek shows of old. This is an easy show to watch, and it wants to make you feel good. The only thing that separates this series from the ideals of the first one, is that Strange New Worlds isn\u2019t nearly as horny as the 1966 series. It\u2019s hornier than its modern contemporaries that\u2019s for sure, but it lacks the near-constant flirtations from The Original Series, which ultimately is a good thing. Still, horniness is as much a part of Star Trek\u2019s DNA as are warp drive and phasers.\nWhile there are going to be clearly inter-connected character stories and arcs for the season, much of Strange New Worlds is episodic. Each week, the Enterprise crew encounters a new problem in a new place, and they have to do their best to solve it. It\u2019s what made every iteration of Star Trek from the Original Series to Enterprise so much fun to watch. You get to know the characters, understand them and even watch them grow. But you can still just jump in once a week for an hour for an uplifting adventure with some space pals. While I personally love everything that has been done with Star Trek in the past dozen or so years (except the Khan fake out, that was wack), Strange New Worlds is like the payoff of that emotional investment. Discovery, Picard, Lower Decks, and Prodigy all have proven that Star Trek is a franchise capable of telling stories with a different tone than what came before. Strange New Worlds is a return to form, and allows us to get the kind of Star Trek stories we\u2019ve missed for more than a decade with big, cinematic VFX.\n\nStar Trek: Strange New Worlds debuts May 5 on Paramount+.", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 0, "created_time": 1649544742060, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Star Trek", "Television", "Review", "Strange New Worlds", "Paramount Plus"]}, {"author": "Joshua M.

Starring The Sopranos alum and E Street Band legend Stevie Van Zandt as a kind of carbon copy of his Silvio Dante character, Lillyhammer was a show made for Norwegian television that Netflix co-funded in order to bring it to the rest of the world. In the years that followed the DVD-by-mail turned streaming service debuted a number of hits that captured the zeitgeist. House of Cards, Orange is the New Black, and the failed Marco Polo were all signs that the era of Prestige TV was about to be led by streaming services. Yet, with the recent announcement that the service lost subscribers for the first time in a decade, investors and (likely) executives in the company are panicked about its future. Yet, since the \u201cStreaming Wars\u201d became a thing, this was always the inevitable result for Netflix. Which begs the question: how were they not prepared for every studio starting its own \u201cNetflix?\u201d\nWhile it feels like a relatively new phenomenon, we\u2019re actually celebrating the 15th anniversary of streaming this year. In 2007, both Netflix and Hulu launched their streaming services, which allowed audiences to view a movie or series without paying individually for it. A year earlier, Amazon entered the video-on-demand game with Prime Video\u2019s ancestor, Amazon Unbox. The videos were available for purchase and there were a lot of limitations. When Netflix, then a company known for mail-order DVDs, introduced their video on demand service it didn\u2019t feel like the seismic shift in the entertainment marketplace that it was. Over the next five years, Netflix proved they could make dynamic original content, and that they had a lot of money to spend. The past 10 years the streaming giant built out its library of exclusive content from developing licensed IPs like The Witcher to originals like The Irishman, an epically long Martin Scorsese movie. This DVD-by-mail website seriously threatened the bottom-line of every major player in both the film and television industries. Begun, the Streaming War had.\nBecause of big media mergers, there was money to spend and deep libraries of film and TV shows to mine. AT&T and Warner Bros., Viacom and Paramount (more of a re-merger) and Disney and 20th Century Fox all are able to build in a few years what it took Netflix a decade to create, with just the things they had lying around the house. In 2019, at my old job, I worked with our TV and Movies Editor Meghan Hale, covering the early days of what we called the Streaming Wars. Even back then it was evident to both of us that in this fight only Netflix had everything to lose. If any of these major studios created a streaming network that failed to turn a profit, they\u2019d just scrap it and license their wares to their former competitors. Universal and Disney both have theme parks, TV networks, movie studios, and all sorts of other revenue streams. Netflix does not.\nIt\u2019s clear that the folks at Netflix realized this early, likely even earlier than the rest of us who pay attention to this stuff. This is why they\u2019ve undergone a massive spending spree to build out their in-house studios and create more original content than any one subscriber could watch. They put out hundreds of shows and movies each year. Yet not one of them captured the national attention like The Mandalorian, the first marquee series from Disney+. When Netflix only had a few shows, like House of Cards or Orange is the New Black or some of the other early hits, they did create genuine buzz. Now, unless it\u2019s one of their IPs like Masters of the Universe: Revelation or The Umbrella Academy, many new Netflix movies and shows are barely a blip on the radar.\nUntil this month, however, it was all academic. Yet, last week Netflix revealed it lost 200,000 subscribers in the first quarter of 2022 and expected to lose 2 million more by the end of the next one. This is the first time since the explosion of streaming that Netflix did continue its growth. Even as the marketplace expanded in 2019 and 2020, the Big Red N was still the top dog. Perhaps, as some corporations do, they bought into their own hype. Even though studios with beloved franchises had their own hubs on the streaming space, Netflix was the pioneer who couldn\u2019t be beaten. Growth would continue forever. Yet, with the post-COVID push to take the movie-going experience back to the theaters, it seems that Netflix has lost its faith. In the question-and-answer session involved with the Q1 earnings report, the Netflix management seemed, in the words of one Variety reporter, \u201creactionary, scattered and just plain scared.\u201d\nOne thing Netflix was very successful at doing was selling itself as an indispensable part of life. \u201cNetflix and chill,\u201d was not merely a 2010s euphemism for hooking up, but a reflection of the ubiquity of the product. The harder sell for Netflix was that it was the future of blockbuster entertainment. When they nabbed the Marvel Television series \u2014 now at home on Disney+ \u2014 at the height of the success of Avengers 2012, Marvel Television delivered something great. Yet, what made it so special was that it was not the blockbuster storytelling fans associated with the Marvel Studios films. These were what TV allows for, lengthy character studies where things can get dark and violent. Later efforts like the Chris Hemsworth-led Extraction and even the Charlize Theron comic book property The Old Guard were a lot of fun but did not feel the same as seeing these big action spectacles in a theater.\nPerhaps this \u2014 and the impending churn of subscribers \u2014 is why Netflix is going off-brand for the release of Bardo (or False Chronicle of a Handful of Truths), the new film from Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu. Netflix has done limited theatrical releases for the films before, usually to qualify for awards. However, the Bardo announcement comes well before the movie, and Netflix seems poised to do a full court press theatrical release. Is Netflix shifting its sights from being the streaming, digital entertainment company of the future to trying to reverse-engineer themselves into a traditional studio? No one can say, because since Netflix lost Ted Sarandos, the company feels as though it lacks the kind of daring and vision it needs from executives to continue to establish itself as a permanent fixture in global entertainment.\nOf course, it\u2019s also entirely possible that all of this is blown out of proportion. Part of the reason Netflix is going to have such a bad second quarter is because they cut off service to Russia as result of their unprovoked war in Ukraine. As the world tries to recover from the COVID pandemic, some folks may just be plan sick and tired of Netflix (and all streaming services). Add to that the Great Resignation of 2021, and folks may need to tighten their wallets as inflation rages mostly unchecked. Perhaps Netflix doesn\u2019t need a visionary to shake things up, perhaps they need a leader who is strong enough to know that whatever is happening to the company right now is the result of something larger than what shows are canceled and which are renewed. Still, the corporate axe has fallen at Netflix. They\u2019ve been laying off employees from content development to marketing.\nNetflix is almost certainly not doomed. Yet, for a company that has only the streaming services it offers to give it value, surviving is not enough. In the eyes of the company\u2019s shareholders, they need to be the top name in streaming or they\u2019re nothing. The only thing that can truly \u201ckill\u201d Netflix is if panicky \u201cnumbers people\u201d fundamentally change the company in ways that destroy what it spent 10 years building. This will be especially disastrous if these first quarters of 2022 are simple outliers as the marketplace, and the world, tries to find its footing again after a mad three years.", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 0, "created_time": 1650995777500, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Netflix", "Streaming", "Streaming War"]}, {"author": "Kelly Liu", "post_id": "18a7873b7f15", "user_id": "13189954d4e7", "title": "Navigating Your Sabbatical in 7 Practical (and Actionable) Steps", "content": "Navigating Your Sabbatical in 7 Practical (and Actionable) Steps\n\nPeople have all sorts of reasons for taking a personal sabbatical\u00b9. Maybe you\u2019re burnt out and want to rest.\nOr maybe you say you want to rest, but you\u2019re really bad at resting, and you just really want to use this time to figure out what you care about and what the heck you want to do with the rest of your life.\nThat was me.\nI wrote this article because while there is tons of general advice out there about how to do a sabbatical, none of it really stuck. In the end I had to make up my own process and see what worked. This meant that I had stretches of great momentum and also weeks of immense frustration and stagnation. To spare you the struggle of inventing a process from scratch, I\u2019ve put together 7 practical and actionable steps to help you get started.\nNote: This is for those people who want to take time off to gain a better understanding of who they are and what they care about. This is not for those taking a break solely to relax or for professors who are on real sabbaticals \u2014 though you\u2019re welcome to read it and see if anything applies.\n1) Make sure you have the resources to take a sabbatical.\nI know I\u2019ve said this before, but I think it is so crucial to having a positive sabbatical that I\u2019m going to say it again. It sucks to spend your time off stressing about your financial runway or health insurance.\nMoney is the most important thing you need to work out. If you\u2019re not sure how much money you\u2019ll need, I\u2019ve made this flow chart I made to help you figure that out:\nNote: this is not approved by a financial institution or advisor \u2014 these are my thoughts only.\nWe often underestimate how much time things take, so it\u2019s very important that you have a comfortable amount of money in the bank\u00b2.\nHere\u2019s a list of some other things you should seriously think about:\nHow will you get health insurance? (Can you get added to a partner\u2019s insurance? Your parents\u2019 plan if you\u2019re under 26?)\nDo you have dependents to care for? If so, how will you care for them during this time?\nAre there any work or life obligations that you must carry out, and will it impact potential time off?\nOnce you feel like you have the resources to be able to take time off and fully enjoy it, then you\u2019re ready to explore the next step.\n2) Give yourself that first month to have fun.\nIf you want to spend your sabbatical doing some serious self re-evaluation, then you need to have the mental and emotional capacity to do so. The best way to get there? Stop thinking so hard and take a real break.\nGo travel. Visit family. Take a staycation. Do something solely for your enjoyment and not for productivity. By immersing yourself in a new and fun experience, you will create some distance between you and your past job. You need space to recuperate emotionally, mentally, and physically. Only when you feel rested and refreshed will you be ready to dive into the rest of your sabbatical.\nHiking 300 miles of the PCT was that \u201csomething new and fun\u201d for me. Backpacking day in and day out forced me to forget about work and slow down. Life became simpler. Job titles, promotions, and publications didn\u2019t matter. I had to learn who I was without my job title or fancy college degree and how to be content with that. It was a powerful experience, and it put me in a good mind space to tackle the rest of my sabbatical.\n3) Ditch the goals and metrics. Let curiosity be your guide.\nIf you had told me that during this time, I should stay away from setting goals, I would have laughed. Goals are great! They help you focus and make progress and get shit done. Goals are a tool \u2014 not a detriment!\nThe thing is, goals and metrics are only helpful if you know where you want to go. They are not helpful if you have no idea where that end destination is or what success should even look like. If you\u2019re not careful, goals can lead you down a path that you follow purely for the sake of completion. They can blind you from recognizing other signs of success. If you\u2019re trying to figure out which path you want to take and what you want to get out of it, then you need a completely different tool.\nYou need curiosity.\nWhen I first decided that I wanted to talk to strangers in Redwood City, I did what people do and I set a goal. I would try to talk to 50 people in my first month. That was 2 people a day \u2014 it seemed reasonable. But I couldn\u2019t do it. I could not get myself out there every day, and I didn\u2019t know why. I was falling behind, and that stressed me out so much that even when I got myself to talk to a stranger, I\u2019d still feel like I\u2019d fallen short even though I was growing more through this project than I ever had in the past year.\nI couldn\u2019t see my own growth because I was focusing on the wrong thing. I was taking my goal way too seriously, and it was hindering me from being able to recognize why I was doing this in the first place. When I finally let go of my goal, that was when I felt free to go at my own pace and experiment. That was when I had the capacity to observe (and actually celebrate!) my growth. And when this project led me to a new topic that was calling my name (learning about communities), I felt okay letting go and moving on to new things.\nWhen you\u2019re trying to figure out what you care about, you need to give yourself the space to explore. Those twenty different hobbies you\u2019ve always thought about but never had time for? Try one out! Dig into new schools of thought. Follow interesting tangents and see where they take you. You don\u2019t have to commit to an area forever \u2014 you\u2019re just here to explore\u00b3. Only when you get a better idea of what gives you energy can you begin to more carefully lay down a plan and set goals.\n4) Set aside time to process how you\u2019re feeling.\nWith so many paths to check out, it can feel overwhelming to keep trying new things. One way you can help guide your exploration is by taking the time to process the feelings that come up along the way. By observing your emotions, you gain better insight on what excites you, what you need, where you\u2019re getting stuck, and where you want to go next.\nIt\u2019s one thing to make time to reflect, it\u2019s another to get yourself to do it. Depending on who you are, this processing work can be pretty difficult to do on your own. I\u2019ve always loved journaling, but during my sabbatical, I realized it wasn\u2019t enough. What I really needed was good conversation.\nSo that\u2019s what I sought out. I tried life coaching\u2074, which helped me unpack a surprising number of mental blocks, from my moments of hesitation to my insecurities to why certain paths that I was scared of would keep popping up in my head. I stumbled upon a peer coaching platform, where engaging in an hour conversation with a stranger would leave me feeling motivated and supported. I pushed myself to reach out to my friends when I needed help working through a struggly day. These conversations gave me the space to make sense of my emotions so that I could get myself to explore the areas that I really wanted. It was through these conversations that I gained the courage to write, to experiment with art, and to get really into communities.\nIt may feel counterintuitive, but stopping and letting yourself process may be just the thing you need to keep moving forward.\n5) Add some structure to your day.\nExploring new things is great, but when you\u2019re exploring on your own with no external goals, I have to admit \u2014 it\u2019s easy to get lost or lose momentum. Some days, I\u2019d find myself scrolling social media, sinking time into chores, and avoiding my projects. Now I\u2019m not saying you should go back to setting strict goals, but what you can do is add in some structure.\nNormally, your job provides you with structure and support to pursue some project. Now that you\u2019re on your own, you have to create this yourself.\nSo what do you need to feel good in your day? Do you need people to converse with? Morning exercise? Coffee shop vibes? An online group? Fellow sabbatical friends? No technology time? A platform to share your work? A (flexible and not self-worth defining) goal to work toward?\nI personally found that I needed daily exercise for my sanity, a writing buddy to keep me accountable, frequent location changes, and almost daily conversations with people in the community building space. By intentionally adding these elements into my day, I was better able to stay excited and motivated to learn about the topics that interested me.\nTest things out and observe how they make you feel. Figuring out what you need to feel good about your work is critical to making long-term progress.\n6) Be bold and ask for help.\nMaybe this isn\u2019t the case for you, but for me, I\u2019ve always struggled to ask for help (I don\u2019t like inconveniencing people, even if they\u2019re my friends). But during my sabbatical, I had to get over it. About halfway through my sabbatical, I got super interested in learning all about what it takes to build a strong community, and I didn\u2019t really know where to go. I had no connections in the field (was it even really considered a field?). I didn\u2019t really even know what to Google. I knew I\u2019d need to ask people \u2014 family, friends of friends, strangers \u2014 for help. To do so, though, I first had to change my relationship with rejection.\nI used to believe that if someone ignored my email or said no, then they probably thought I wasn\u2019t worth their time. After sending tons of cold emails each week during this time, I\u2019ve come to realize that rejections generally happen for two reasons. 1) People are super bad with email and forget to respond or 2) they have their own shit going on and don\u2019t have capacity. Basically, it\u2019s almost never about you.\nInstead of assuming someone was too well known or too busy to talk to me, I would assume a mindset of curiosity \u2014 I wonder if this person will talk to me? \u2014 and send an email. If they didn\u2019t respond, I\u2019d assume that they might have forgotten and would appreciate a reminder. So I\u2019d send it again. And again. And again.\nThrough this persistence, I was able to\nlisten and learn from those that had gone through sabbaticals/career pivots before.\nlearn more about a philanthropy, a job sector that I previously knew nothing about and knew no one in.\nfind interesting projects to join that allowed me to further explore community building.\ngain insight and perspective from interesting strangers in my neighborhood and people online.\nbuild stronger relationships with friends, family, and acquaintances in ways that I had before.\nAt a certain point, you won\u2019t learn anything more from another google search or reddit post. You need to talk to someone and learn from your conversation. So take the leap and reach out. You don\u2019t have to do it all on your own.\n7) Be nice to yourself and be patient.\nMost of us are not patient people. We regularly see people\u2019s latest feats on social media. Every few days, someone seems to have done something big, and we keep falling behind. We just can\u2019t move fast enough to get to where we want to be.\nEven though I knew the value of exploration, curiosity, and all that, I couldn\u2019t help but feel frustrated because I felt like I should be moving faster. I wasn\u2019t writing fast enough. I couldn\u2019t make enough headway in my research. I\u2019d spin my wheels for weeks and then still have no idea what I wanted my future job to be.\nWe forget that things take time. During my sabbatical, I would often look up people that I admired and learn their backstory to remind myself that most of the time, it takes people years to get to where they are. There will be some days that you get a ton done and others where you get lost in a really great kdrama. Some days you might chase a lead that goes absolutely nowhere, and on others, you find a fascinating peer in your space. One unexpected conversation could change everything. In one week I went from fretting about the type of job I should pursue to suddenly having a job offer at an interesting company that I\u2019d stumbled upon weeks earlier. The results of your efforts will not be linear, and we have to recognize that.\nSo be kind to yourself. Persevere. Be patient. And enjoy the process. You will find some clarity in due time.\n\u2014\nThoughts? Stories to share? I\u2019d love to hear how others out there are structuring their sabbaticals and what is working or isn\u2019t working. Don\u2019t be afraid to say hi :)\n\u2014\nNotes\n\u00b9 Time off, on leave, funemployment \u2014 these are all terms I\u2019ve heard people use when they quit their jobs to take a break. I\u2019ve chosen to use the word \u201csabbatical\u201d. While I know my time off wasn\u2019t technically a sabbatical (I\u2019m not a professor, and I\u2019m not writing a book), I think it better describes the work I was doing better than the other words out there. If you have a better word, I\u2019m all ears. I\u2019m not here to fight about terminology.\n\u00b2 What if you don\u2019t quite have that much money? Then consider the following:\nAre you willing to pull from any of your investments to help fund your sabbatical?\nAre you willing to ask any family or close relations to help you if you need it?\nAre you willing to spend some of your sabbatical working a part-time job to extend your time off?\nIf your answer is no to all of those options, then it might not be the right time for you to take a long break (honestly, you have to be pretty damn privileged to be able to do so). It may be worth exploring some alternatives instead.\nOne option is that you could look for a new job while still working at your original job, and then take time off between your two gigs. You\u2019ll need time and mental capacity to make this work, but it means you\u2019ll feel financially secure during your time off. Another option is to continue your job, but spend outside time working on whatever it is you\u2019d want to explore during your sabbatical. It may be hard to context switch between job mode and self exploration mode \u2014 but things like coaching, self reflection, and conversation may help.\n\u00b3 To give you a sense of what this exploration can look like, here\u2019s what I meandered through in my first 4 months:\nLife coaching\nStorytelling\nPeer coaching circles\nTalking to strangers for fun\nRunning a project based social media account\nBeing a group facilitator\nWalking through new neighborhoods in the Bay that I had never been to before\nBay Area census data\nMaking digital art\nJoining a filmmakers group\nA new pen art style\nWriting\nMeeting local officials and commission leaders\nPhilanthropic giving in the Bay Area\nDowntown Streets Team\nInteresting online communities\nSome I did for a few weeks, others I explored for a few days. Through all of this, I was able to gain a new appreciation of the arts, practicing creativity, and developing voice.\n\u2074 Coaching was initially a hard pill to swallow, especially because I\u2019d never spent money on my mental health before. I was lucky enough to have two very understanding coaches who gave me the opportunity to experience coaching at a discounted rate while I worked through that mental block. After many monthly coaching sessions, I can say with confidence that coaching was integral to my emotional growth. Thank you Amie and Anthony for the thought provoking conversations and great questions.", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 41, "created_time": 1646104198717, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Sabbatical", "Tech", "Funemployment", "Life Journey"]}, {"author": "Kelly Liu", "post_id": "4c53f86b8497", "user_id": "13189954d4e7", "title": "5 Things I Wish I Knew Before Going on Sabbatical", "content": "5 Things I Wish I Knew Before Going on Sabbatical\n\nI\u2019d originally planned to take off 3 months. I was tired and frustrated, and all I wanted was to get out of my job in tech and see what else was out there. I thought that by September 2021 I\u2019d have been able to take a break, figure out what matters to me, and pivot into a new job that felt more meaningful.\nWell here we are, in January 2022. It\u2019s taken me an extra 4 months, but I\u2019m finally at a point that I can bring my self-prescribed sabbatical to a close. It\u2019s been an unexpectedly trying journey \u2014 far from the travel-the-world, drinks-by-the-beach, \u201cfun\u201d-employment experience that people expect. I did learn a LOT about myself \u2014 though none of it was easy. I figured out what I\u2019m passionate about \u2014 after months of ambiguity, self-denial, and difficult conversation. And I found a new job \u2014 after much hesitation to commit to any path.\nThough I am completely and utterly grateful to have had this time to regroup, reflect, and reorient, I do think there are some things I could have known from the beginning that would have made this a lot easier. I\u2019d like to share these thoughts with you, in case one day you\u2019re considering jumping off the 9\u20135 work train and pivoting your career, so that you can be more informed before you take that plunge.\n1) You\u2019ll be on sabbatical longer than you think.\nI thought I would figure it all out in 3 months. But somehow I always needed more time. By September, I told my partner I needed until October. By October, I realized I needed until the end of the year. By the end of the year, I realized I might need up to 6 more months to secure a job. There was so much more to uncover than I realized \u2014 a spontaneous conversation would lead me to a new interesting organization, a phone call would reveal a whole new job field, a pointed question would force me to work through some tough realizations about myself. With so much to explore, I simply needed more time.\nThere\u2019s always more to work through than you think there is, and this might be the first time you\u2019ve ever gotten to fully explore! There\u2019s a reason most people I knew who took time off in the past had done so for a minimum of one full year. So do yourself a favor and double the amount of time you think you\u2019ll need. It\u2019ll save you the surprise of needing additional time off, and you\u2019ll likely use all that time anyways.\n2) Don\u2019t underestimate the importance of money.\nYes, this is probably obvious to a lot of people. But, as someone who grew up in an upper middle class family and then went straight into tech after college, I had never felt the need to pay close attention to my finances. I was privileged, and that made me blissfully unaware.\nMy sabbatical was the first time I faced true anxiety and stress around money. Taking off more time than I had originally planned for did not come without consequences. By month 4, I no longer felt like I could freely explore because every month, my bank account sank lower and lower to uncomfortable levels, with no money coming in. I began to watch how often I ate out and grew wary of grabbing food with my better off tech friends. My partner and I chose to stay local for his vacation. We had numerous stressful conversations about my job search progress as my partner fretted about having to cover our costs singlehandedly with his meager medical resident salary. When I tried to work some side jobs to support myself, I became acutely aware of how difficult it is to make money that you can live off of and how incredibly cushy it is to work in tech. With my diminishing savings, I felt like I couldn\u2019t afford to look for a job on my own terms, which meant that job searching became stressful as fuck.*\nWithout a solid financial plan, I constantly felt stressed about money in the latter half of my sabbatical, which meant that I had less energy to stay curious in my explorations. In the end, I was lucky to have parents who were willing and able to help me out, and by letting myself accept their support, I gained some room to breathe. With money comes stability and peace of mind, and that is not something to be underestimated.\n3) Dictating your own time is not all rainbows and butterflies.\nFor a long time, I didn\u2019t understand how people could be content with just working a standard 9\u20135 job and then going home. Instead, I looked up to startup founders and small business owners, people who were brave enough to create something of their own that they really cared about. I was excited to have a chance to try out that self-directed lifestyle, where I could make my own decisions and pursue my own path.\nWhen I told people I was taking time off, they typically saw this as something super awesome, saying things like, \u201cIt\u2019s so cool that you\u2019re just doing your own thing\u201d or \u201cYou\u2019re totally living the life!\u201d But after 7 months of sabbatical, I can tell you that being your own boss is not easy. It was exhilarating for sure to have complete control of your time and endless avenues to explore. But that amount of freedom was also terrifying. Because without the 9\u20135, you have no default structure. You have no guidance. No one depends on your work, so no one has to check up on your progress. All you have is your own steadfast belief in yourself, what you\u2019re doing, and why you are doing it. And if you can\u2019t commit to yourself firmly enough, you will struggle.\nSo there is something nice about a 9\u20135. Not only does it provide financial stability, but it also provides structure. And with that structure comes less mental load. At a traditional job, you don\u2019t necessarily have to come up with your own goals; the company gives it to you. You\u2019re given a regular schedule and teammates to talk to. You\u2019re given accountability because your work matters to your company. And when the work day ends, you can do whatever you want with the rest of your evening.\nBoth lifestyles have different forms of freedom. Just make sure you\u2019re prepared for the pros and cons of the one you choose.\n4) It will be an emotional rollercoaster.\nA sabbatical gives you space to slow down and think, with very little distraction in the way. I wanted to figure out what I cared about most and how to make that into a career, and for the first time in my life, I had the time and space to do that. Doing this work was incredibly hard. It required me to delve into my deepest fears and insecurities. I had to wrestle with my need for recognition and prestige vs. my desire to be true to my interests. I struggled with identifying my strengths, a situation that forced me to confront my relationship with myself. It was illuminating, exhausting, but also highly rewarding.\nEven if you don\u2019t choose to take a long, hard look at yourself during your sabbatical, each day can still be emotionally challenging. I struggled a lot with staying emotionally grounded. One day I\u2019d be ecstatic about a great conversation I had with an inspiring community leader, and on the very next day, I\u2019d feel like shit because I didn\u2019t get enough done. My emotional fluctuation was astounding \u2014 and I think it was because I never felt secure enough about the value of my explorations. As time goes on, I\u2019m learning to be more patient. I\u2019ve accepted that the things I\u2019m exploring might take a lifetime to understand. All I can do now is try to be kinder to myself and accept the highs and lows of this journey.\n5) You won\u2019t figure it all out.\nIf you were hoping, like me, that a sabbatical could magically help you identify your life purpose, then you\u2019re going to be in for a wake up call. The truth is, there are a bajillion different paths that you can take next. While you may wish for one obvious choice, you\u2019re probably not going to find it because in reality, none of those possible paths are going to be a bad choice.\nDuring my sabbatical, I discovered philanthropies, non-profit consulting, community management, business school, policy school, and tech as potential career next steps. The number of options I had was paralyzing. I was terrified of making the wrong choice, and so for a long time I didn\u2019t make any at all.\nBut at some point, you have to move forward. You have to choose a path. If that path is awesome, then great! If that path sucks, that\u2019s okay! You will have learned something, and now you can go try something else. There are still so many paths just waiting to be discovered, and if you can try even just one, then your sabbatical will have been a success.\n\u2014\nEven though there is a lot about a sabbatical that is daunting, if you asked me if I\u2019d do it again, I\u2019d say yes every single time. There will always be unexpected hurdles, but the personal growth was so rewarding. I learned more about myself in 7 months than I have in years. I finally admitted to myself that I love building relationships and creating warm fuzzy places of belonging, even though I had been trained in the objective world of hard science and tech. I realized that I wasn\u2019t ready to go after my own project or idea full-time, and that I currently want to learn from others at a company provides me some structure. And I\u2019ve accepted that I don\u2019t need to be a start-up founder or a super technical person to prove myself to others.\nThough my sabbatical has come to end, my commitment to exploration will continue onward. Specifically, I will continue to explore what strong communities look like in both physical and virtual spaces. Next month, I\u2019ll be joining Orbit to help community managers build stronger online communities. I\u2019ll be supporting Redwood City\u2019s Downtown Streets Team through work on the community advisory board. I\u2019m exploring what an ultimate frisbee team could look like if it was centered around community instead of around winning. I\u2019m grateful that my sabbatical gave me time to discover my passion for communities and build the right mindset for lifelong learning. I\u2019m super excited to tackle this next phase of my life with curiosity, intention, and a constant lookout for growth.\n\u2014\nNotes\n* I understand everyone has different thresholds for financial stress and so I want to be transparent about my financial situation. I was essentially \u201ccash-poor\u201d, meaning that I had low liquid assets (aka money that could be easily pulled from my bank account). I knew I comfortably had enough for 3\u20134 months off, but that 7 months off would be my upper limit. I had money set aside in some investments and my retirement account, but I made a conscious choice to try to not pull any money from these sources. When my liquid assets got tighter and I was seriously considering pulling money out of my investment account to help, my parents stepped in and decided they\u2019d rather provide me some money instead of having me cash out on my money in the market.\n\u2014\nHave opinions?

Redwall, The Chronicles of Narnia, Inkheart, Artemis Fowl \u2014 each book beckoned me to a far off magical place. Their words transported me alongside characters who bravely left home, faced countless obstacles, and found hidden strengths. I hoped that one day I could do the same and be just as courageous and resilient.\nAs I grew older, my childhood dream of embarking on a fantastical quest morphed into the young adult equivalent: doing something abroad. I was fascinated by the stories of people who left home to study turtles in the Mediterranean or to farm in the Himalayas. To be honest, I had no idea where I wanted to go or what I\u2019d want to do. I just longed to join that exclusive club of people who were brave enough to live far away and who came back more grounded than before.\nAnd so I looked across the sea for my own adventure. When I learned MIT offered a month long program to teach abroad, I immediately applied and participated three times, traveling to Israel, South Africa, and Italy. I refused to look for internships in Boston because going out-of-state seemed much more exciting.\nAt the time, these trips brought me so much joy. I was finally out there, exploring this wondrous world! But these didn\u2019t count as true adventure. No real bravery was required, no major hurdles had to be overcome. Each trip was prepackaged, perfectly designed by someone else to fit nicely into my college schedule. Even though I had long dreamed of journeying solo, I never did. Because deep down, the idea of stepping into the unknown alone scared me. It was far easier to stick with the options that were safe.\nIt was January of 2018. If I were still at MIT, I would have been flying out of Boston with a bunch of other undergrads, nervous but eager to teach science in another country. But this year, I\u2019d be doing what I had done ever since I left college \u2014 working in San Francisco as a software engineer.\nCode. Rummage through the snack baskets. Write tests. Share my progress. Repeat.\nIn comparison to my time teaching abroad, my day to day rhythm felt stuffy and stagnant. Not that my life was bad. In fact, my company let me work from home anytime, even if I was visiting family on the opposite coast. I just longed to do something different.\nA thought popped into my head. What if I worked remotely overseas? I started daydreaming about being anywhere but here \u2014 France, Italy, Switzerland, there were so many exciting places I could go! My imagination whirred, lifting me from the humdrum of everyday life.\nUntil one day, my boyfriend Justin decided that he had had enough. As I was excitedly describing to him yet another country that would be nice to work from, he interrupted.\n\u201cLook, you\u2019ve been talking about this idea for the past three months. But I know you\u2019re not going to do anything about it.\u201d\nI was taken aback. What was wrong with a little bit of dreaming? I wasn\u2019t trying to plan this trip for real yet, though I was sure I could if I wanted to!\nHe continued, unfazed by my accusatory expression. \u201cBut if you are planning to, then do it. Prove me wrong.\u201d\nCould I be scared to take the next step? Looking back, I can see that I was hesitating for fear of tackling a lofty idea and failing. But at the time, I convinced myself that this was not the case, that I\u2019d show him. Though I was too proud to acknowledge it then, Justin\u2019s challenge was the push I needed to start turning my dream into reality.\nSo I got to work, scrolling through immigration sites and travel blogs until my eyes were bloodshot. Several weeks and many pros and cons lists later, I settled on a destination \u2014 New Zealand. The time zones were ideal for remote work, the scenery was straight out of the Lord of the Rings, and the people were supposedly extraordinarily nice. And, to top things off, there were even women\u2019s ultimate frisbee teams there! This was it. This was going to be my first real adventure.\nii.\nHello Wellington!\nIn November later that year, I found myself in Wellington, a city that I had chosen purely because of a friend\u2019s one day visit, a stranger\u2019s blog, and the medal placement of the women\u2019s ultimate team at nationals.\n\u201cYay we\u2019re here!!\u201d my mom exclaimed, her face lit up with excitement.\nYep, my mom had flown over with me. She said she needed a short vacation, but we both knew that she was really here to make sure that I\u2019d be alright. As much as I would have liked to have carried out my vision of leaving the country alone, I was secretly happy that she was here with me.\nBecause even though I was excited, I was also nervous. This was the first time that I had moved somewhere not because I was supposed to, but because I chose to. If I disliked the place, I would only have myself to blame. And that scared me.\nOn the airport bus, I got my first glimpse of the city. Green rolling hills hugged the coastline, with cute, white and yellow houses nestled in the slopes. The scenery felt oddly familiar. It felt like \u2014 the Bay Area. My heart sank. Did I really travel halfway across the world only to end up in another San Francisco? When we arrived at our hotel, my disappointment only grew. We were right in the heart of another financial district, filled with the usual shiny tall buildings, high end storefronts, and deserted streets after hours.\nI wanted to flee, but there was one problem. I had confidently told so many people that I\u2019d be in Wellington. Some friends had even already bought plane tickets to visit. To change my mind this quickly would be embarrassing and inconvenient. Panic rose in my chest. I was stuck in this city, and I couldn\u2019t do anything about it.\nMy irritation ballooned, casting a gloom over not only me, but also my mom. After a few days, she had to say something.\n\u201cKelly?\u201d\nI looked up at her from the couch on which I was sprawled, too unmotivated to get up.\n\u201cDo you remember how hard it was for you when you first moved to San Francisco for your job?\u201d She chuckled to herself. \u201cYou used to call me every day, complaining about the city.\u201d\nI grimaced. That was indeed a difficult adjustment.\n\u201cBut then look what happened. You started doing things, going on hiking trips and making new friends, and you became happy there! This trip isn\u2019t so different. It\u2019s just that this time no one told you to move here.\u201d\nMaybe that\u2019s why, instead of adapting to the situation, I kept second guessing myself. I just didn\u2019t know how to trust my own decisions.\nMy mom got up from her chair and sat by my side. \u201cLet\u2019s give this place a chance, like you would if you had to live here. And then you can decide in a week if you want to stay.\u201d\nI sighed and nodded. Okay. I would try.\niii.\nAfter my mom left, my life in Wellington was defined by three types of moments: moments of kindness, moments of loneliness, and moments of initiative.\nmoments of kindness\nIt was the end of my first frisbee scrimmage, and the time I dreaded was here \u2014 finding my way home. I slowly untied my cleats, trying to look occupied while I thought through my options. There was no bus back, and I didn\u2019t want to inconvenience anyone by asking for a ride. I picked myself up and walked with purpose towards the park exit, hoping there might be Ubers around. But before I reached the road, a beat-up, red car pulled up beside me.\n\u201cHey! Need a ride?\u201d\nThe driver was a woman on my team who had showed up late to our game. She smiled at me as I climbed in the car.\n\u201cSo, where are we going? I can go anywhere in the city.\u201d\nThough, as I\u2019d later learn, she didn\u2019t live anywhere near my hotel, she cheerfully drove me back. She seemed to know exactly what little things were hard for someone new to town, reminding me of her name without prompting and reassuring me over and over that someone would always be willing to give me a ride. When she dropped me off, she left with a friendly \u201cSee you next week!\u201d. I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll ever know just how grateful I was for her warmth and understanding. That small gesture of kindness gave me hope that I\u2019d be able to find a welcoming community.\nThere was one place in Wellington where I immediately felt comfortable, and surprisingly, I found it on my morning commute. I had expected that morning walk to be nothing special. But when I reached the edge of Central Park, I came to a halt. Instead of the fresh mulch and clean cut grass that normally define a city park, standing before me was a full on forest.\nOne of the many paths through Central Park\nWhen I set foot on the dirt path, the rumble of cars was replaced with birdsong, and the relentless tempo of the working world seemed to fall away. The trail meandered along a quiet trickling stream and over wooden footbridges. I walked past moss laden logs and one out of place eucalyptus tree. And with each step, the stress, tentativeness, and insecurity weighing on me was replaced with joy.\nI felt joy being among the trees, the ground, the birds, the sky. There was nothing to prove to the ferns. I didn\u2019t have to make conversation with the grass. I could stop and stare at the alien looking lichen hanging from a tree and there was nothing stopping me. In this place, my outside worries about work or life didn\u2019t matter. The forest welcomed me with open arms.\nmoments of loneliness\nThese moments of hospitality made up only a small part of my day. For the rest of it, I was acutely aware of how alone I was in this city.\nDuring the work day, while everyone else was chatting to their officemates, I asked for a table for one at a cafe and hid among the seats at the bar so that I stood out less while working by myself.\nBefore frisbee scrimmages, I took my sweet time lacing up my cleats and warming up because I didn\u2019t want to look helpless while I nervously scanned the sidelines for an approachable person to throw with.\nOn a Friday afternoon, I would walk along the waterfront to enjoy the start of my weekend, only to drift past people laughing and lounging on beanbags under the sun, students diving off the pier with their friends, and parents strolling behind their wandering children.\n\nI tried to distract myself by marveling at the towering pinnacles in the east or the sparkling blue sounds in the south. I focused on recognizing the calls of native birds while walking around into the city. I wrote and rewrote schedules to impose structure on my life. But these actions could not mask my ever-present loneliness. I had always prided myself on being self-reliant, but now it seemed like a lie. I didn\u2019t actually know how to be alone. All I really wanted was to belong.\nmoments of initiative\nWhat better way to feel alone than to spend Thanksgiving in a foreign country away from family. Thanksgiving was still a week away, yet I couldn\u2019t help but think about what my family would be doing that day. My sister would be painstakingly shaping artsy pie crusts while my mom and cousin deftly chopped vegetables and chatted away. My dad would be rolling up his sleeves, readying himself to roast the perfect turkey. And I would be dusting off the board games that we pulled out just for this day and sneaking bites of each dish before dinner. But not this year. This would be the first year that I\u2019d spend it alone.\nI furiously tried to shake away my self-pity. I knew how to cook Thanksgiving foods \u2014 there was nothing stopping me from having my own feast. The image of me sitting at the dining table, happily surrounded by steaming plates of mashed potatoes and crispy stuffing crystallized in my mind. But just as quickly, the scene reappeared in a different light, and all I could see were the five chairs at the table beside me, blatantly empty.\nIt was pathetic. I had come all this way to participate in a new community, yet here I was, prepared to spend a holiday all about community on my own.\nMaybe I could invite my flatmates. But a doubting voice murmured in my ear. They have their own lives, own friends, own events \u2014 how do you know if they even want to join?\nI didn\u2019t.\nNormally, I would leave it at that. Taking initiative with people I didn\u2019t know well had never come naturally to me. I avoided networking events of all kinds. People I wanted to befriend remained strangers because they seemed too cool for me. Old friends fell out of touch, and I didn\u2019t try to reconnect.\nI used to play it off like this was my personal choice. But deep down, I think I was scared of rejection. My self worth was so intertwined with the opinions of others that when I did not receive outside validation, my confidence teetered. So I just chose to stick with people I knew. But in New Zealand, where I was alone and surrounded by strangers with their own communities, my reluctance to reach out would not do.\nI had to learn to be mentally strong enough to put myself out there without it threatening my self confidence. If I wanted a community, I had to do something about it. And at that moment I resolved to try.\nOne week later, and I was frantically scrambling around the kitchen, mixing mashed potatoes, and peeling apples, trying to do everything in parallel with utmost efficiency. Seb and Anneke offered to help, but I politely refused \u2014 if I was going to host them, I had to do it right! But somehow, they managed to gracefully weave themselves into the kitchen chaos, whisking food to the table and lighting candles for atmosphere.\n\u201cWow! I\u2019ve never celebrated Thanksgiving before!! This is amazing!\u201d said Diana as she eagerly sat herself at the table. With the table all set, Seb, Anneke, Diana, Hamid, and I began to feast. We stuffed our bellies with food and painted the air with stories of our lives. We speculated about the origin of stuffing, a dish that Diana and Hamid had never had before, and chuckled at Seb\u2019s proclamation that, though he had always disliked sweet potato, he somehow couldn\u2019t stop eating the sweet potato casserole. And as our conversation rolled along effortlessly, I couldn\u2019t help but smile. While this Thanksgiving wasn\u2019t spent with my own community, I was on the road to finding a new one.\niv.\nWhether it was a conscious decision or just the passing of time, I began to find my place in Wellington.\nat home\nIn 6 months, the flatmates that I found through Facebook became my very good friends. It was with these people that I attempted numerous cooking challenges, from making boba with what turned out to be sago to crafting improvised dumpling pancakes after losing half of the frozen dumpling skins to the microwave. These were the people that would, after missing the bus, walk 45 minutes with me up a huge hill to get home because there was no rush and it was a beautiful day anyways.\nWe had a comfortable rhythm in our cute, yellow house, one that was entirely different from the frenetic pace of the tech world. In fact, none of my flatmates were in tech. They were working towards dreams of designing fashion for the runway, owning a local business, practicing law and economics abroad, or teaching primary school students. They did not care about streamlining every aspect of their lives. Instead, they enjoyed cooking their own meals and actually hearing about each other\u2019s work days. Even if it was a weekday night, we\u2019d talk for hours in the kitchen about books, pottery design, or fascinating lawsuits.\nSpending time with my flatmates taught me that it was okay to slow down and not constantly be working towards a goal, career-based or otherwise. And with time, I learned that even a Sunday spent making pancakes and reading on the patio could count as a good one. In that house on McKinley, with its tiny feijoa tree, endless chocolate supply, and fresh lemon cakes, I found a warm and welcoming home.\nThe first of many flat dinners :D\non the field\nAfter that first going-home-from-frisbee fail, I quickly confirmed that the friendliness I had experienced that day was not a fluke. The women\u2019s ultimate community in Wellington was the most inclusive and spirited frisbee club that I had ever been a part of. Beginners and vets, high schoolers and working adults, natives and ex-pats, daughters and even their mothers, all played side by side in this wonderful jumble of a group. At tournaments, we ate lollies, chased bubbles, and cheered for each other even when we faced off in the finals. We exchanged stories about how we ended up in New Zealand during car rides to team events. And we hung out off the field as well, chucking frisbees in 30 mph winds and racing each other to see who could carry a potato the fastest from one line to another using only our legs. Over the course of the season, these 60 once-strangers became my teammates who I will forever remember.\nRepeat Offenders at Nationals\non my own\nAs for the hours I used to dread spending alone, I got used to it. After having to decide where to go and what to do just about every day, I realized that it was pointless to feverishly optimize every decision. What did it matter which sandwich I picked, or whether I went to watch the fireworks at the waterfront by myself. It was more important to just make a choice, go with it, and then see what happens.\nWith this change in my mindset, my alone time became empowering.\nIt was in New Zealand that I decided to try solo backpacking. On these trips, I tramped through pouring rain, across swinging bridges, and over gnarly tree roots, with the thoughtful narration of Robin Wall Kimmerer as my most reliable company. Time lost all urgency on my walks. Being alone meant that I could pay more attention to my surroundings, observing miniature alpine plants the size of a penny or the flax lilies changing with the season. I sat for ages on mountaintops, gazing at the lush green peaks that stretched to the ocean. The nights peacefully drifted by, as I swapped life stories with fellow hikers at the huts. And watching the sunrises the next morning was astounding. These trips were my time to think about nature, people, and my own mind. And being alone gave me the opportunity to do it.\nWatching the clouds at the Pinnacles\nv.\nI used to think people were supposed to come back from journeys like this filled with groundbreaking revelations and an unshakeable new sense of self. So when I returned, I looked inward to identify exactly how New Zealand had changed me. I felt like I had made major strides as a person in the past half year \u2014 I\u2019d had the guts to quit my software developer job to pursue product management, I cherished my family and friends to a new degree, and I felt more confident conversing with random people than I ever had before. I\u2019d even learned to take a break and enjoy solo time on the weekends. But as much as I tried to find the root cause for this growth, I could not say whether these changes were from living in New Zealand, or from just growing up.\nEven if New Zealand itself was not the reason for my personal growth, going there allowed me to experience a completely new community in which to play, learn, and grow. And I\u2019ll really miss it. I\u2019ll miss the funky cafes with their chocolate dusted cappuccinos. I\u2019ll miss my sunset walks to the Brooklyn Wind Turbine where I had a view of the entire city. And I\u2019ll deeply miss the Wellington ultimate community and my flatmates, who welcomed me into their lives.\nThe next time someone asks me, \u2018How was New Zealand\u2019, there\u2019s a reason I can\u2019t give a one word answer. Because it was so much more than one word. It was a journey of emotions, mental strength, friendship, and introspection. There were happy moments, and there were hard moments. And as more time passes, this experience feels more like what it had once started as \u2014 merely a dream.\n", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 25, "created_time": 1562082072008, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Travel", "New Zealand", "Living Abroad"]}, {"author": "Paul Mason", "post_id": "a37f9f1fe6e9", "user_id": "5cd6b1aab45f", "title": "Ukraine: The Politics of Dying", "content": "Ukraine: The Politics of Dying\nHow the West\u2019s political dynamics are changing\nDowning Street Demonstration: 24 Feb 2022\nIt\u2019s Day Two of the Ukraine invasion and so far we have only maps and episodes. The 13 Ukrainian defenders of Snake Island telling a Russian naval commander to \u201cgo fuck yourself\u201d before going heroically to their deaths. The Ukrainian aircraft shot down over Kiev. A bridge blown. Some captured Russian paratroopers claiming they thought they were on an exercise\u2026\nThis morning it looks like the Russian armoured and airmobile advances have made progress on all fronts. Toward Kyiv, through Sumy and in particluar north-west out of Crimea towards Odessa. A Ukrainian summary at 05:37 today suggests Ukraine has deployed elite units to stop two large armoured columns driving down the right bank of the Dnepr, between Dimer and Yankiv about 35km north of Kyiv.\n05:37 25 February, Source: Ukraine Ministry of Culture and Information Policy\nHowever, what we don\u2019t know are how many soldiers and vehicles the Russians have lost; what their supply status is; and importantly what their morale is, given large public demonstrations in many Russian cities, and mass arrests. Nor is it clear how badly the Ukrainian army is suffering. Nor is it clear what level of civil control the Rosgvardia units are exerting along the supply lines.\nNational security experts studying the intel believe this is a major Russian invasion attempt, along four axes. The speculative map of Russian intent drawn by Micheal Kofman last night (with the usual caveats) accords with what Ukrainian sources suggested in Kyiv on Monday.\nImputed Russian invasion plan. Source: @KofmanMichael\nBut lines on a map tell you nothing. War \u2014 especially wars of conquest \u2014 are social events, not just military ones. Russia could achieve freedom of movement along every red line on this map and yet still not \u201coccupy\u201d Ukraine \u2014 and indeed be left negotating with a Lviv-based government with no access to the Black Sea at the endgame.\nOvernight I\u2019ve had the official Ukrainian government account of the situation. It calls on its Western allies to break diplomatic contact with Russia (they haven\u2019t), to impose SWIFT sanctions (they haven\u2019t) and \u2014 as on yesterday\u2019s Downing Street demonstration \u2014 their underlying demand is for a no-fly zone, which the West will not impose.\nThe sanctions story, meanwhile, remains one of tough talking, targeted action but no Western agreement on the \u201cnuclear option\u201d of collapsing Russia\u2019s banks through exclusion from the SWIFT payment system.\nTo understand where this goes next we need to watch three dynamics: the politics of Ukrainian resistance, the Russian anti-war movement, and the depth of Western rethinking about global security and democracy.\nYesterday was the moment even sceptics finally understood that Russia and China have abandoned the rules-based global order for a mercurial chaos based on armed force. They understood that Putin and Xi are no longer issuing calls for a more equitable global arrangement, but imposing it by killing people. The rules based order has been replaced with systemic conflict.\nMost ordinary people have no idea that this will impact their lives \u2014 so the diplomatic grandstanding and the fireworks take on the aspect of a spectacle for now. But oil prices are above $100, the Russian stock market has collapsed (it\u2019ll go lower), Taiwan has pulled its chip exports to Russia and we should soon expect disruptions to the European gas supply.\nOnce they do understand they are going to face hardship, disruption, threats to their personal security and a permanently insecure world, where there are no universal concepts of truth and human rights, the battle is on between three political forces to shape their response\u2026.\nSocialist Action Twitter account\nThe first force is Russian and Chinese proxy ideologies: Fox News in America, Socialist Action in the UK, whose Twitter feed \u2014 three hours after Russia declared war on Ukraine \u2014 hailed the Russian troops as \u201cdefenders and peacekeepers\u201d, pluse the combined forces of the AfD and left-wing maverick Sara Wagenknecht in Germany.\nTheir message will be: American imperialism is as bad as Russia; the Russians felt justifiably threatened; the Ukrainians are all Nazis and \u2014 as the impact bites \u2014 it\u2019s not worth the cost to you in gas prices, food prices and cancelled holiday flights. For the really dedicated, like Kent academic Richard Sakwa, they will insist China\u2019s vision of the new order is actually better than the old one.\nThis is the classic appeasement agenda of the 1930s tailored to the TikTok generation. So far, Russia\u2019s sheer brutality and Putin\u2019s deranged narcissism is neutralising this ideology. But it will proliferate, especially among far-right inclined people already trapped in a mesh of conspiracy theories and chagrin at their own powerlessness.\nNYT 17 Feb 2022\nThe second force is \u201cliberalism\u201d \u2014 which should really be called neoliberal conservatism. David Brooks summarised the moral collapse of neoliberalism in the face of Xi and Putin well, in the New York Times (writing before Putin\u2019s attack). In the 1990s everything was going our way, now it\u2019s going to shit. The reason? The classic conservative view of human nature was forgotten. We presumed people were good, but they\u2019re basically evil and will follow dictators unless we teach them not to. The result:\nToday, across left and right, millions of Americans see U.S. efforts abroad as little more than imperialism, \u201cendless wars\u201d and domination. They don\u2019t believe in the postwar project and refuse to provide popular support for it.\nIn Brooks\u2019 account of the sudden collapse of consent for liberal democracy, social injustice plays no role: wage stagnation, perpetual humiliation, the shattered coherence of freemarket ideology, the gross and expanding inequalities arising from central bank money creation\u2026 not worth talking about. It\u2019s human nature that\u2019s the problem.\nBrooks\u2019 solution \u2014 laughably given what\u2019s just happened \u2014 is to teach people to \u201cavoid catastrophism, conspiracy and apocalyptic thinking\u201d. Strengthen institutions. The idea that US capitalism, to save itself from collapsing into a second American civil war, might deliver social, racial and climate justice to the people who are pissed off with it, never enters the debate.\nThe third force is what I\u2019ve called since 2015 revolutionary reformism, or radical social democracy. There is a clear agenda in the world, pre-existing this war crisis, that says: for the ecosystem to survive we have to decarbonise, redistribute wealth, take collective (state, common or mutual) control of the economy \u2014 and guarantee every citizen maximum individual freedom. We protect democracy by deepening it, clearing out our own oligarchs and not just the Russian and Chinese billionaires, putting the deep state under control and breaking up the tech monopolies.\nThe critical question, for the fate Western democratic culture, is how this third, progressive faction within society reacts. I place myself in this tradition, so I am well aware of its basic weakness: the liberal assumption that all people are good, and will take rational decisions if they are only informed and self-organised.\nIts\u2019 other weakness is to detest and distrust the state. To see Boris Johnson, the recipient of \u00a32m of Russian oligarchic cash, posing as some kind of David to Putin\u2019s Goliath is truly sick-making to all of us. How can we trust the state that launched the Gulf War \u2014 in defiance of international law \u2014 to combat Putin\u2019s attempt to destroy international law? How can we trust the nepotistic cabal in Downing Street that partied while we suffered?\nThe answer is, we\u2019re going to have to transform everything. The activists of Sotsialny Rukh in Kyiv, who I met earlier this week, understood this within hours of the Russian invasion of Donbas. Their statement read:\nOnly a socialist and democratic Ukraine can resist the oligarchic authoritarianism of the Russian Federation. Preserving the independence of our country depends on abandoning the model of oligarchic capitalism. These include the nationalization of the financial system and strategic enterprises, the confiscation of luxuries, and a ban on capital outflows. Without these measures, the burden of military spending will fall on the poor labor majority of Ukraine. Democratization and the unification of society require the rejection of scandalous decommunization laws.\nThis, in reality, is the call to turn Ukraine\u2019s war of resistance, triggered by the overreach and unreality of the Zelensky regime, into a people\u2019s war across Ukraine, Russia and Belarus.\nThis, of course, is the one outcome liberalism can\u2019t imagine. Johnson and Biden both stressed their proposed sanctions would \u201chobble the regime over time\u201d. But what we needed was sanctions that would collapse the Russian state overnight. Liberalism never wants to outline the end-point to sanctions \u2014 but it can only be either an oligarchic coup, staged by other mafiosi keen to keep their diamonds and furs, or the Russian people.\nHow much the executives of Citibank and BP would like a Russia under the control of its people \u2014 or indeed Ukraine \u2014 I leave you to guess.\nThe conflict that just broke out is not an extension of the 8-year Donbas war. It is the first phase of global, systemic conflict \u2014 between democracies and dictatorships, between the rule of law and anarchy, and between truth and disinformation.\nNo matter how much Western liberals and the left despise each other, it requires them to come together and defend the system in which they can operate.\nThat\u2019s what I think the Donbas miners meant when, on Tuesday, they were phoning the HQ of their independent union saying \u2014 we\u2019ve run away once, this time we\u2019re fighting. Deeply critical of the Zelensky government, and of the EU-backed privatisation agenda, and mainly Russian speakers, they understood from bitter experience there is no space for social justice or workers rights in Putin\u2019s world.\nFraming this as a systemic conflict allows us to calibrate the issues of democracy and social justice against the interests of working people, minorities and youth.\nWe should support Ukraine against Russia because it is fighting both a war of self-determination, and a systemic conflict between a flawed democracy and a militarist dictatorship.\nNATO cannot and should not fight Russia; nor should the USA seek military confrontation with China over Taiwan.\nWe need to turn NATO into a truly defensive alliance, capable of conventional deterrence, with its militaries democratised and its state machine under democratic control.\nThe US-EU bloc is still \u2014 if you want to use the term \u2014 an imperialism. Look at the armful of railway contracts Macron walked away with after his visit to Kyiv, even as Ukraine\u2019s railway managers are at war with their own unions. No working class or young person has an interest in fighting and dying for Alstom.\nBut the defence and deepening of democracy is different. To survive this systemic conflict, Western democracies will have to do something that people like David Brooks think is impossible: they will have to become socially just, transparently democratic and non-oligarchic.\nThis is going to be a long, people\u2019s war against dictatorship, militarism and oligarchic power. Count yourself lucky you are fighting it in London or Athens \u2014 not Dimer and Yankiv.\nI got out of Kyiv Tuesday night and am in London. Thanks for all the good wishes. On Saturday at 12 noon I\u2019ll be speaking at a demo outside the Russian Embassy.

No.\nThis was the week America took charge of the Russia-Ukraine war. It stated two war aims:\nthe weakening of Russia to the point where it can no longer threaten its European neighbours;\nand the defence of an armed, sovereign and democratic Ukraine (though indeterminate as to the territory it would exist on).\nAnd then it began to mobilise the means. It convened the Ukraine Defense Consultative Group of 40 countries, to co-ordinate the continous supply of heavy weapons and ammunition to Ukraine. And Biden asked Congress for a $33bn war chest: $20bn for arms, $8.5bn for economic assistance and $3bn for humanitarian aid. They even revived the Lend-Lease Act to authorise donation of arms to Ukraine.\nFor those like me, on the left, who\u2019ve supported Ukraine \u2014 including calling for sanctions, aid, debt relief and arms \u2014 it poses an obvious question: is this about to become a 1914-style conflict, in which the Ukrainian people are just pawns in a bigger game, with nothing progressive at stake for the working class?\nThat has been the line peddled by the pro-Russian left since the start, along with whole side-menu of slanders: that the entire 102,000 Ukrainian National Guard is fascist, that Zelensky\u2019s repression of various pro-Russian national bolshevik groups is unjust, and that the Donbas separatists are resisting genocide.\nBut because supporting Putin\u2019s war justifications largely bombed outside the dedicated circles of Neo-Stalinists, a softer argument was advanced through various front initiatives: ceasefire now, negotiations, no to arms supplies because they can \u201conly prolong the suffering\u201d, and in addition might trigger a nuclear war.\nThis came in different variations : the leadership of the old German peace movement, for example, demanding the surrender three Ukrainian cities to Russia which are not even under siege.\nStop The War in Britain even argued that they were supporting Zelensky by calling for a \u201cceasefire and neutrality\u201d \u2014 ignoring the fact that Zelensky\u2019s negotiating position called for an armed neutrality guaranteed by Western powers (ie a Nato-style defence pact).\nBiden\u2019s offer decoded\nBut that phase of the war is over. America\u2019s offer to Putin, decoded, is pretty clear: we don\u2019t want to overthrow you, we don\u2019t want to destabilise you; but the more of your army you throw into Ukraine, the more it\u2019s now going to get smashed by superior weapons and realtime intelligence supplied by Western allies, and an increasingly NATO-ised Ukrainian army.\nIt is without doubt that, during the phase when Kyiv and Kharkiv were at risk, there was a faction of the USA prepared to fund a trickle of arms into Ukraine, to keep Putin weakened and off balance, so they could get on with their primary obsession: confronting China.\nBut they seem for now to have lost the argument. The USA spies a bigger prize. If Putin refuses to disengage soon, it has the chance to do to Russia what Russia did to the West over Georgia \u2014 inflict geopolitical retreat and humiliation, strategically removing Putin\u2019s appetite for aggression, and his ability to deploy a serious land component in the near future.\nSince, on 4 February, Putin and Xi declared that the world is now composed of three power blocs, and the rules based global order is over, US strategists have seized the chance to make sure that the weakest of those power blocs becomes weaker.\nThere is, of course, the chance that the realisation of his predicament will trigger Putin to use nuclear weapons. But the risk of nuclear war lies in Putin\u2019s brain, not in any action the West might take (short of NATO actively seeking conflict with Russian forces).\nAs I wrote last week: when a totalitarian narcissist starts making nuclear threats, there are no good choices.\nIf Western civil society, and parts of the Western left, want to begin from the premise that \u201cnuclear war must be avoided at all costs\u201d, the logic is that, at the moment it becomes real \u2014 say Putin drops a small bomb on the battlefield in Ukraine \u2014 we have to surrender Ukraine plus see the half of Europe he wants demilitarised and neutralised. In addition we must accede to his demand (co-signed with Xi) for no more colour revolutions (aka no more capacity building for opposition parties and human rights groups by the West).\nIt\u2019s a logical position. You could even justify it in the same way the pro-appeasement wing of British imperialism did between 1937 and 1940: if we leave Hitler alone to destroy Europe he won\u2019t touch us. For genuine religious and ethical pacifists it\u2019s an understandable position to take.\nBut for the left it would be the wrong position. The Ukrainian left, human rights groups and trade unions are actively supporting the war of resistance because they know: there is no space for survival on the other side of the lines. Not for unions, not for the left, not for LGBTQ+ people, not for minorities \u2014 not even for the Ukrainian school curriculum and language, if we judge by the horrific antics of the Russians in Kherson.\nI\u2019ve argued, since the crisis started, that there are three aspects to the conflict:\nUkraine\u2019s justified struggle for sovereignty and self-determination, made doubly just by the genocidal actions and intent shown at Bucha, the forced population transfers, the linguistic imperialism and the organised sexual violence.\nInter-imperialist rivalry between a declining US superpower, allied to an emergent EU seeking \u201cstrategic autonomy\u201d; versus an imperialist Russian rentier state that knows it is doomed once the carbon age ends; backed (passively) by a rising Chinese imperialism, which sees the conflict as a chance to enlarge its own geostrategic space.\nA systemic conflict, declared on 4 February 2022 by Putin and Xi, in which the charter system inaugurated by the UN is to be replaced by great power politics, and in which the Western system based on bourgeois democracy and the rule of international law will be aggressively undermined by totalitarian and anti-modern ideologies, spread through greyzone warfare.\nThe question for the left is: which aspect is dominant; and what does this interplay of class, national and geostrategic forces mean for the working class?\nRichard Seymour, in his Patreon newsletter, engages more intelligently with this conundrum than most of the Leninist left, who cannot see beyond the 1914 parallel, and are blindly \u201capplying\u201d a 105 year old theory, seemingly oblivious to the intervening decades of theoretical debate and historical change. (I\u2019m writing something big on this\u2026)\nSeymour grants that Ukraine has the right to arm itself, and that it can only get such arms from the West. That\u2019s a commendable position for a leftist from the Cliff-ite tradition to take.\nBut, he says, the left should not try to \u201csupport, or radicalise, the policy of imperialist states who are planning for a long war in which Ukraine\u2019s defences are reinforced but there is no decisive military intervention\u201d. He also opposes the left demanding arms for Ukraine because of the danger of nuclear rhetoric.\nBut what\u2019s the alternative? When a group of British Labour activists bought a pile of kevlar jackets to send direct, in a van, to Ukrainian trade union militia members in the Donbas, there was no legal way of getting them across Europe other than in the British imperialist diplomatic bag. It\u2019s not even possible for civilians to legally buy a night-vision device in large parts of Europe, let alone get it into the right hands in Ukraine.\n(Here by the way, if we\u2019re using First World War parallels, is the exact same problem faced by both Roger Casement and Lenin, both of whom had to rely on German imperialism to aid their anti-imperialist efforts.)\nFor me, the decisive issue is the systemic character of the war. Seymour believes this is an impossible position for a Marxist to take \u2014 but it was the de facto position of the communist-led resistance movements in Axis occupied Europe and China. They saw the war not simply as just and defensive, but potentially transformative.\nJust as in the Second World War, there is no space for survival for the left, the workers\u2019 movement, feminism, human rights defenders \u2014 and I mean absolute zero space \u2014 either in the Chinese or the Russian totalitarian system.\nYes, the West \u2014 via UN-sanctioned NATO interventions and via direct and illegal intervention \u2014 has committed horror upon horror, from Yemen to Afghanistan and Iraq. Yes it is run by a rentier financial elite. And yes we should go on prosecuting the domestic class struggle \u2014 against everything from shit landlords to the Nationality and Borders bill.\nBut we need to support the new determination to arm Ukraine.\nOn Lenin\u2019s principle that \u201cthe truth is always concrete\u201d, look at it from the point of view of a worker in the militia in Kryvyi Rih, a proletarian stronghold lying right in the path of the advancing Russian army.\nThey\u2019re armed with AKs and molotovs and, if they\u2019re lucky, have something better than a 1944-issue Maxim gun. They\u2019re ready to fight because they\u2019re defending their national sovereignty, their linguistic existence, and their physical bodies from execution, torture and sexual violence.\nThey\u2019re defending a democracy that has, under the cover of EU orientation, tried to privatise their industries, cut their pay and conditions, and de-recognise their unions. But its systemically preferable to what\u2019s coming their way.\nFor them, the inter-imperialist character of the war is, if they are class conscious, something they will have to deal with later. Right now they need the professional army defending them to have tanks, artillery, anti-aircraft guns and a steady supply of ammunution.\nThe apparently separate qualities of the war \u2014 national, inter-imperialist, systemic \u2014 merge concretely into a single reality, whose immediate problem is: how to avoid the city being devastated and its inhabitants subjected to crimes against humanity.\nOffensive weapons?\nCritics of the arms supplies should forget the question of \u201coffensive versus defensive\u201d weapons. All weapons kill people. You could smuggle an NLAW into a Russian city and fire it at a busload of civilians if you wanted to.\nAnd forget the question of which territory weapons are allowed to fire on. Russia is claiming all occupied territory as Russian \u2014 it has just issued the first Russian birth certificate to a baby born in Mariupol. So forbidding attacks on Russian territory is a meaningless condition for arms supplies.\nThe social democratic, green and left parties in Europe and the Americas should go on voting for arms to Ukraine so long as the war remains just \u2014 which in Ukraine\u2019s case means strategically defensive of its territory and its people. (Any leftist who tells you there are no just wars hasn\u2019t read Marx, the Comintern or Che Guevara.)\nUnless the Putin regime collapses I can see zero chance of the Americans letting Ukraine trying to retake the L/DNR. And even Zelensky signalled a 15 year moratorium on the status of Crimea. So practically a Ukrainian victory means driving the Russians out of Kherson province, destroying them in the Donbas and forcing an ignominous pull out to save the rest, once the Switchblades get working. The USA has gone for this because, after two months of military incompetence on the Russian side, they and the Ukranian people believe it\u2019s possible.\nI don\u2019t know what Seymour means by \u201cradicalising\u201d the policy of arms supply. I am against euphemisms. The sanctions are a form of economic war; the arms supplies, in their new iteration, clearly carry the intent of proxy warfare on the American side. The question is, in all cases, is justice on the side of the defender?\nPost-war struggle\nHowever, the left \u2014 both in the West and Ukraine \u2014 should now be planning actively to place demands and conditions on the reconstruction effort. For example, at the reoccupied Chernobyl plant there is already a dispute with the workforce over contracts.\nWith left, right and centre now operating politically inside the Ukrainian armed forces, one point of vigilance should be to oppose any attempt to shut down the anarchist, left, trade union-dominated territorial units (while leaving the politicised far-right elements of Pravi Sector and Azov to operate freely).\nAnother point of vigilance should be against the predictable US/EU attempts to privatise and acquire infrastructure and real estate under cover of the reconstruction effort \u2014 and to build economic fiefdoms with the aid of Ukrainian oligarchs.\nAt a more strategic level, the whole Ukrainian civil society needs to understand that aid comes at an economic and political price. Lend-lease, let us remember, substantially stripped the British Empire of its power and possessions. The Ukrainian youth who dream of a Scandinavian liberalism as the result of national sovereignty may find they just get plain old American freemarket capitalism, as South Korea did.\nThe outcome will depend on the political struggle; whether, as the Ukrainian left group puts it, the war becomes a \u201cpeople\u2019s war\u201d. And on how much pressure social-democrats and progressives in Europe and America can put on their own governments.\nFinally, let\u2019s remeber that the America that piles in under Biden may pile straight back out again if Trump wins in 2024, leaving the under-armed and fractious EU powers to pick up the pieces, and Ukraine yet again without guarantees.\nThe coming dangers\nWith each fragmentary engagement in the Donbas battle, it becomes more likley that Russia cannot win it. It needs to double-encircle the Ukrainians \u2014 matching its advances from Iziyum with a broader circular thrust from Kharkiv. This analysis from Ian Matveev shows how unlikely that is.\nThere are signs that Putin will respond to these frustrations by declaring all out war on Ukraine on 9 May. But the US move has to give him pause. The ongoing revolution in military affairs is allowing drone-targeted artillery and shoulder launched missiles to inflict serious damage on the biggest armoured force in the world.\nThose who survive now sit at the end of precarious supply lines, with an increasingly active armed insurgency and effective special forces. If, by September, they are stuck there, and facing relentless attrition from NATO-standard artillery, there is a danger that Putin will \u201cescalate to de-escalate\u201d: drop a small nuclear bomb and rush to the negotiating table.\nEven if there\u2019s a 10% chance of that, then we are in a period more dangerous than at any time since 1945. Combined with the threat of the international far right, social networks awash with genocidal fantasies, and the ever present climate chaos it\u2019s easy to feel hopeless or helpless.\nBut the workers, youth and progressive sections of society have a weapon more powerful than nukes: revolt.\nThat\u2019s why for us, the outcome of the war can\u2019t be a weakened Putin, or a frozen conflict. It has to be the overthrow of Putin and Lukashenka, and the radical democratisation of a post-conflict Ukraine, sweeping away the persistent remnants of oligarchic power, strengthening the rule of law, and constructing a genuine social-democratic party to contest elections.\nAnd in the West, as I\u2019ve written elsewhere, the entry of Sweden and Finland into NATO, together with strong social-democratic and green influence in the governments of Germany, Portugal and Spain, allows us to redefine NATO as a defensive-only alliance, setting aside the \u201cout of area\u201d adventures and the British Tories mad vision of a \u201cglobal NATO\u201d.\nThe US intervention certainly generalises the conflict, raises the stakes and the dangers. But it doesn\u2019t change the concrete character of the war on the ground. Ukraine\u2019s cause is just and the global labour movement should go on supporting arms to Ukraine, sanctions against Russia and capacity building for a progressive movement that can deepen democracy and social justice in Ukraine itself.\nI\u2019ve unmetered this piece for maximum circulation.

Source: Nexta\nUkraine: Transnistria 101\nPutin\u2019s strategy of tension on the Dniestr. Where?\nIn the past two days, there\u2019ve been three explosions in the Russian-backed enclave of Transnistria, plus two missile strikes on a crucial Ukrainian rail bridge over the River Dniestr, causing the government of neighbouring Moldova to hold an emergency national security meeting.\nI last visited Transnistria in 2014, undercover, after Putin\u2019s seizure of Crimea. To understand why tension in two small countries to the West of Ukraine could spell big trouble, here\u2019s basic Q&A. You\u2019re going to need a map.\nSource: ISW\nWhat is Transnistria?\nIt\u2019s a heavily-armed breakaway republic from the country of Moldova, occupying a long, thin sliver of territory mostly the East bank of the river Dneistr, with a population of 475,000. It was formed after a short civil war in 1991, when the Soviet Union broke up and Moldova became independent. It\u2019s not recognised under international law and is run by a Russian-backed mafia.\nWhat\u2019s the source of tension?\nMoldava\u2019s population is 4.5m, 90% of whom speak Romanian. Transnistria is much more multi-ethnic, with about a third each of Russian, Ukrainian and Moldovan \u2014 but it\u2019s run by the Russian mafia, and supported with Russian money, and is effectively a heavily armed, repressive military base and ammo dump for Russia on Ukraine\u2019s Western border.\nHow did it get that way?\nAt the start of the Second World War, the USSR stuck together various Romanian-speaking territories into the Soviet Socialist Republic of Moldova. This was then conquered by the Nazis. At the end of the war, following the massacre of 200,000 Jews, massive civilian wartime casualties and a famine, it was repopulated by Russian and Ukrainian speaking workers, especially on the East bank of the Dnieper (now Transnistria). When the Soviet Union fell apart \u2014 and Moldova took a pro-Western orientation \u2014 the pro-Russian population fought a civil war to set up Transnistria.\nWhat is it like?\nI went there undercover in 2014, just after the seizure of Crimea. It\u2019s like a museum of the USSR, heavily armed, with a government that does not pick up the phone to journalists. Compared to Moldava it\u2019s clean, orderly and developed, with much of the private sector owned by a single oligarchic company. It\u2019s a mafia state and completely unviable without Russian money.\nHow does it fit in with the war in Ukraine?\n1,500 heavily armed Russian troops are based in Transnistria (about two battalions plus special forces). The enclave\u2019s own, Russian-backed army is four times the size of Moldova\u2019s. Moldova is a neutral country, with few effective armed forces and a military budget of 0.3% of GDP. If Transnistria attacked Moldova, it would fold quickly \u2014 despite its current pro-Western liberal government \u2014 giving Russia a bargaining chip in the wider international crisis. Moldova is currently run by the pro-Western liberal Maia Sandu. Her prime minister, Natalia Gavrili\u021ba, called an emergency national security meeting yesterday.\nGavrilita and Sandu meet German foreign minister Baerbock. Source gov.md\nWill Transnistria attack Moldova?\nHopefully not. But if Russian troops in Transnistria attack Ukraine they would pin down Ukrainian troops and, crucially, allow Russia to stage its long-awaited amphibious operation against the Ukrainian port of Odesa.\nWill Transnistria attack Ukraine?\nIt\u2019s been quiet until now. But in the past two days there have been three \u201cattacks\u201d in Transnistria. Two blew up an important TV tower, broadcasting Russian propaganda to Ukraine. One hit a public building. My hunch is these are \u201cfalse flags\u201d by Russia to provoke tension (because why would Ukraine want to open a new battle in its rear?). In addition Russia has twice struck the nearby railway bridge in Ukraine at Zatoka.\nSource: Liveuamap.ua\nWhy is the railway bridge important?\nTake a look at the next map (below). The river Dniestr estuary blocks access from southwest Ukraine, and NATO-member Romania, into the rest of Ukraine. There is a road through Moldava \u2014 and if the West uses it, it drags Moldava into the conflict. So the Zakota bridge is the only rail and road route from NATO territory into South-West Ukraine. Block it and you block a crucial route for arms, humanitarian supplies and Ukrainian exports. Yesterday\u2019s strike missed the railway track. Today\u2019s strike has closed the bridge.\nSource: Liveuamap.ua\nWill Russia attack Odesa?\nRussia has assembled an amphibious landing force within reach of Odesa. The sinking of the Moskva made an attack more risky. But last week a Russian commander stated that their aim was to capture the whole Ukrainian coastline from Kherson to Odesa. If they decide do so, a Russian attack out of Transnistria, combined with the seizure/destruction of the bridges over the Dniestr, would be likely.\nWhat\u2019s the big picture?\nMoldova itself is politically unstable. It has a 5% Turkic ethnic minority in the southern region of Gaugazia who generally support Russia, and a pro-Russian communist party with about 20% of the vote. In addition it has been run by oligarchs for decades, and is extremely poor by European standards. Between 2019 and 2021 pro-Western liberals led by Maia Sandu managed to gain control the parliament and the presidency, despite strong Russian interference. (This being a long-term oligarchic state, I use the word liberal here in a very broad sense). But with no serious armed forces, and a big pro-Russian opposition party, Moldova is vulnerable to Russian pressure \u2014 especially because it is reliant on Russian gas.\nWorst case scenario?\nA report by the Jamestown Foundation (a neocon US think-tank) warns:\nMoldova\u2019s total capitulation would have significant effects not only for itself, but for NATO as well. Given its proximity to NATO borders, and shared language and culture with EU and NATO member Romania, Moldova would likely become a highly effective operational hub for Russia\u2019s further strategic actions against the Euro-Atlantic alliance\u2019s southeastern front.\nBest case scenario?\nSandu\u2019s government maintains political stability in Moldova. Ukraine goes on deterring an amphibious operation against Odesa. Russia judges its forces in Transnistria are too weak and isolated to attack. The bridge gets mended.

They\u2019ve moved away from \u201ccrisis management\u201d, Sherr noted, and begun to supply heavy weapons, but had yet to come up with a strategic goal.\nYesterday, the USA came up with one. On his return from Kyiv Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin told reporters:\n\u201cWe want to see Russia weakened to the degree it cannot do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine.\u201d He added the aim was that \u201cUkraine remain a sovereign country, a democratic country, able to protect its sovereign territory.\u201d\nThat is a major turning point in the conflict.\nUp to now, as Sherr points out, the West has been concerned to offer Russia \u201coff-ramps\u201d from confrontation; it has promoted the idea of ceasefires and negotiations which, if successful, might have left Russian troops in place and \u2014 depending on how badly Ukraine was doing on the battlefield, forced it to accept disarmed neutrality.\nNot any more. Sherr complains that the West lacks strategists. That can\u2019t be said of Ausin, who is former commander of CENTCOM and a four star general. So his words in Poland have to be taken as a finely calibrated statement of strategic intent.\nThere is no talk of decapitation; nor of destabilising the Putin regime; or of direct military intervention against Russia. The German think tank SWP points out how simultaneously hegemonic, yet fragile, Putin\u2019s rule has become during the crisis:\nIf its pinnacle is destabilised the power vertical faces acute danger of collapse. And if the Russian political system implodes a major destabilisation must be expected. Regional secessionism, violence, even civil war would not be excluded.\nBut pouring heavy weapons into Ukraine \u2014 and more importantly guaranteeing a steady flow of ammunition, both of Soviet calibre and of the more sophisticated (and long-term sustainable) Western alternatives \u2014 America is signalling to Russia that it cannot achieve its own objective.\nThe only way Russia is going to end up so weak that it can never again invade another country is if it expends irreplaceable stores of Cold War weaponry in an attack on the Donbas, and suffers massive attrition.\nIf he doesn\u2019t attack now, says the logic of Austin\u2019s offer, Putin can reorganise his seriously depleted army and remain a global military power. He will be left clinging to an indefensible strip of land along Ukraine\u2019s Azov coastline, and the war, effectively, will be over.\nBy stating a clear, strategic aim ahead of today\u2019s meeting of at Ramstein, Germany, Austen also lays down a challenge \u2014 and indeed a set of choices \u2014 to America\u2019s allies.\nWhat will Europe\u2019s powers do?\nThey can declare the same aims: a decisively weakened Russia; plus a soveriegn, armed Ukraine. Or they can simply supply Ukraine. Or not. Either way, they now know what a US-led coalition of the willing is trying to achieve.\nThis has been \u201cbash Olof Scholz week\u201d, after the German chancellor expressed fears of nuclear retaliation, and the German press revealed the slow fulfilment of some arms pledges to Kyiv. But I am not so down on Scholz.\nHe declared the Zeitenwende and won a decisive part of the German political class to the concept; he committed \u20ac100bn to defence; initiated the the reform of the military; he unblocked the EU and European Council as actors in the crisis and stopped vetoing the use of certain assets owned by NATO.\nThe rational core of Scholz\u2019 reticence is clear: due to years of underspending the Bundeswehr have very little left to give without undermining Germany\u2019s own security; this could soon be true of some other players.\nHis red line is no NATO participation in Ukraine war. He expresses the worry that, by supplying arms, Germany makes itself a nuclear target. But all other states have the same risk to consider. Scholz, here, is simply reflecting the widespread pacifism and anti-militarism of his own society and party base. And there is not a single country, the US included, whose legislature would allow it to participate directly in the Ukraine war.\nMacron, likewise, does not have a free hand. His victory was delivered by left-wing switch voters from Melenchon and other left candidates. Melenchon is pressing for a left surge in the Assembly elections, which could be framed around \u201cNo Arms to Ukraine\u201d. Christian Rodriguez, of La France Insoumise, was a prominent participant at the Madrid peace conference I reported on last week, whose signature demand is the end of arms supplies to the beleaguered Ukrainians.\nMadrid Peace Conference 22 April 2022.\nI expect the Brits will sign up explicitly to Austin\u2019s stated aim, plus the Poles and the Baltic states. The others may be content to join an arms supply and training consortium at Ramstein, because Austin and Blinken have not only invited governments but national and transnational defence contractors, signalling there is an upside even for those who don\u2019t want to commit politically.\nBy the end of the day, the Ukrainain people won\u2019t just have a signal from the US: they should have a fairly certain pledge of arms, ammunition, training and money from a coalition of the willing.\nWho will guarantee Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty?\nWhat remains to be seen is: which countries are prepared to guarantee Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty as a democratic and armed state? And what is the territory on which that sovereignty will be exercised? If I was at today\u2019s press conference, that\u2019s the question I would ask.\nUnless it falls apart spectacularly this week, America\u2019s gambit at Ramstein could be a turning point in the crisis.\nThe US pledge to reduce Russia to a military power incapable of offensive land warfare is achievable only if Putin launches his second phase attack. His off ramp is to get out of Ukraine fast and let 40 million people get on with building a diverse, European democracy.\nTo support my work please follow me on Twitter and RT my stuff @paulmasonnews", "comment_count": 5, "like_count": 392, "created_time": 1650957477989, "comment": [{"user_id": "5cd6b1aab45f", "comment_time": 1650957477989, "comment": "Thank you for sharing!"}, {"user_id": "10db7d37b401", "comment_time": 1651130970591, "comment": "It is fool hardy and arrogant to broadcast your strategy.

He once lost our home, on the turn of a card. The poor man had a rather unhappy childhood. He married my mother, who came from a very large farming family, where boys were best and girls came second, if at all. The boys got the best cuts of meat, and the best educations. Despite working every bit as hard as the boys on their farm, the girls were just second rate. My mother\u2019s mother, judging by photographs of her deeply unhappy face at her children\u2019s weddings, had learned that life was a misery \u2014 she hadn\u2019t wanted all the children she had had, breast feeding until each child was two years old to try to prevent ovulation. No prizes for guessing that my mother had some issues as well. When my parents married it was a match made in \u2026certainly not heaven.\nI was sexually molested at age 4. At age 9, I was becoming my mother\u2019s scapegoat, told her \u201cYou don\u2019t love me\u201d, and got a thrashing for my trouble. I won\u2019t bore readers with further descriptions of my mother\u2019s scapegoating but they were many, and worse. By age 16 I was having sex with my first boyfriend and when we broke up, I kept having sex with my boyfriends, and a number of much older men, usually my bosses. Many years later, I realised that I had been giving sex in the hope of getting love and affection in return.\nAt 19, I married the first man who asked me and no prizes for guessing that he was abusive \u2014 physically, verbally, psychologically and emotionally abusive, but hey, I\u2019d been brought up to believe that abuse is just part and parcel of love. By my late twenties, I was having suicidal thoughts. We had a child when I was 31 and another when I was 34. Unsurprisingly, my husband was not a good father. By the time I was 35, I was suicidally ideated and had a plan to gas myself and my two babies in the car. (The judgers can call me a selfish bitch, but actually, there was no way I was going to leave my innocent babies behind to be raised by their nasty, abusive father. As for my family? That was another dead end.)\nWhat stopped me? I realized that, as my babies were so much smaller than me, they would die before me, and I would be alive knowing that my babies were dead and I had killed them. Worse, what if I was found before I died? That thought was more dreadful than the thought of staying alive, so I decided that plan was a no go.\nThen I met another man, whom I loved deeply. Of course, with my history it will come as no surprise that I was out of the frying pan into the fire. Finally, I went to my doctor (a woman) who diagnosed my depression, and prescribed anti-depressants which worked well until I again became suicidally ideated, when she put me on stronger anti-depressants.\nWhat about a holistic approach? I worked full time, volunteered at my children\u2019s school, exercised four times a week \u2014 swimming, power walking, step aerobics and karate \u2014 had hobbies, had friends and family, kept my home and garden spotless and beautiful, cooked wholesome meals seven days a week, including fruit and eggs. I read numerous self help books, I didn\u2019t smoke and I basically didn\u2019t drink. My children were at least as clean, tidy and well presented as their peers. What else would the \u201cholistics\u201d suggest?\nThe problem was: I was unloved, unsupported, and desperately in need of a person who had my back and would share my burdens. And, basically, that was my life story. You can\u2019t build strong foundations on sand.\nYou can\u2019t grow up feeling unloved, abused, scorned, humiliated, used, and not pay a heavy price somewhere along the line. You can only run on empty for a limited time until everything comes crashing down.\nAnd I\u2019m one of the lucky ones! I\u2019m still standing!\nI was financially exploited and left homeless by my second husband who claimed he loved me for twenty-two years whilst abusing me (and my children for some years).\nBut I struck back every, single, time! And how did I do that? Anti-depressants! Ultimately, I was taking double doses of two different anti-depressants for a few years (psychiatrist prescribed, thank you). I was able to cut back to just a double dose of one medication for some years, but currently I take a quadruple dose daily.\nI\u2019ve made it back to the surface, now, and I\u2019m treading water and getting my life back on track, at age 70, once again. Unable to practise in my profession due to a disability, I now do cleaning to supplement my government benefit.\nI have consulted with psychologists and counsellors over the years, I\u2019ve read many self-help books. Holistic approaches certainly have their role, but I\u2019d be dead if it wasn\u2019t for anti-depressants. You have to feel a lift in your spirits, a bit of positivity, even a sense of hopefulness when you start taking your medications, in order to start improving your mental outlook.\nIf you haven\u2019t had depression yourself, stop pretending to understand it.\nAnd one other thing? I\u2019m just damned lucky that somewhere in my psyche I have strength that a lot of people just don\u2019t have! Somehow, I\u2019ve managed to drag myself out of bed each day, maintain my standards, fight the good fight. Yes, I\u2019m very lucky.\nAnd at the end of the day, that\u2019s all it is.\nFor more of the good stuff, follow Fourth Wave, where we\u2019re changing the world for the better, one story at a time.

And the reason for this? Ultimately, (as men completely ran the world up until the 1960\u2019s) the reason is male privilege, male entitlement: men didn\u2019t want women to have the right to \u201cabort their seed\u201d. (Thank you to Carol Campbell for her information about \u201cmale seed\u201d being enshrined in Greek mythology and canonized by the church fathers who believed that semen is the vehicle of souls, and women are incubators.)\nIn September 2021, Pastor Rich Bitterman expounded upon his reasons for his anti-abortion stance. He cited bible quotes and medical notes (some of which were inaccurate) to make his point: that abortion is cruel, evil, a sin, the murder of innocent boys and girls. However, Rich acknowledges that, even in \u201cthe Church\u201d, abortion rates are in keeping with the secular population. I\u2019ll take his word for that because, in general, women are ashamed to admit they\u2019ve had an abortion, regardless of the reason: and there are many good reasons: poverty, homelessness, addiction, domestic violence, immaturity, are just a few of them. Women should not be shamed for having an abortion. Bringing a human being into the world is not something that should be taken lightly : human beings require optimal conditions to grow into healthy, responsible, productive members of society, and when these optimal conditions are not available, we see the results in our jails, on the streets, in the slums, in shelters, in rehabs and hospitals, to name a few!\nLet\u2019s set the record straight here, Rich: no woman wants to have an abortion, no woman sets out to need an abortion. Brave women who make a reasoned, responsible decision to abort only do it because they feel they must. Women generally don\u2019t have abortions simply because the pregnancy is \u201cinconvenient\u201d, Rich, despite your assertion that they do.\nWomen have had enough of being shamed about their bodily functions! Ashamed of our periods, afraid of having a red stain on the back of our clothes, ashamed of pregnancy outside marriage, ashamed/afraid of losing their virginity \u2014 let us not forget the hanging of the bed sheet on the balcony the morning after the wedding to prove a woman was a virgin \u2014 ashamed of enjoying sex, ashamed of having an abortion!\nYes, over the centuries, women have borne the \u201cshame\u201d, the \u201csin\u201d, of pregnancy outside of marriage. The fact that it was a male, in every single instance, apart from the Virgin Mary, who provided the sperm, was completely overlooked: it was women who were scorned, vilified, abandoned, condemned and in some cases, stoned to death \u2014 after all, you can\u2019t hide a pregnant belly for long. Some women chose death rather than the shame.\nNow let\u2019s get back to circumcision, female circumcision in particular, or female genital mutilation \u2014 FGM : it\u2019s very different to male circumcision \u2014 because male circumcision, apparently, doesn\u2019t have much, if any, impact on a man\u2019s enjoyment of sex. On the other hand, FGM destroys a woman\u2019s ability to enjoy sex \u2014 that\u2019s what it\u2019s meant to do \u2014 and causes any number of health problems. For some more information on female genital mutilation, please go to What is FGM \u2014 Desert Flower Foundation .\nAlthough FGM is often carried out by women, often with crude instruments under crude and unhygienic conditions, let\u2019s face it, it wouldn\u2019t be done if men didn\u2019t condone it; if men wanted their women to enjoy sexual intercourse, if men didn\u2019t want this control over women.\nIt\u2019s yet another example of male domination over female bodies to a hideously cruel and inhuman extent.\nNow let\u2019s give this scenario some consideration: \u201cMale Circumcision reduces risk of oncogenic HPV genotypes, cervical cancer, T. vaginalis, bacterial vaginosis and possibly genital ulcer disease in women. The reduction in risk of these STIs and cervical cancer adds to the data supporting global efforts to deploy Male Circumcision as a health-promoting and life-saving public health measure and supplements other STI prevention strategies.\u201d ( Front Public Health, v.7:2019, PMC6365441)\nSo, if circumcision in males is associated with a lower incidence of cervical cancer in women, what if a group of female politicians mandated that ALL males be circumcised? No longer a \u201cchoice\u201d for parents, but a legal requirement!\nAfter all, cervical cancer is cruel and could result in death \u2014 or might we say \u201cmurder\u201d? I know of a woman whose husband remarried twice after she divorced him. All three women developed cervical cancer. The man was not circumcised. This was before we discovered the relationship between viruses, circumcision and cervical cancer.\nIn no way do I suggest that circumcision \u2014 the removal of a piece of skin at the end of the penis \u2014 is at all comparable to abortion. It most certainly is not \u2014 nor is it in any way comparable to enforced pregnancy and childbirth!\nMale circumcision is a relatively simple and painless procedure when done with anaesthetic. However, I\u2019d like men to give some thought to their response if a group of women demanded that all men be circumcised to reduce the incidence of cervical cancer in women!\nOh! The outcry! The outrage! I know that many men would happily comply out of their desire to protect their partners, but how many would rebel against such an imposition? How many privileged males would demand \u201cHow dare they?\u201d\nYes indeed.\nYet millions of men around the world take it upon themselves to tell women how they should conduct themselves when they find themselves with an unwanted pregnancy; millions of men condone female genital mutilation.\nThey wouldn\u2019t want women to force them to have a piece of skin cut off the end of their penis, but they think they have the right to force women to gestate for nine months and then give birth? I don\u2019t know what the fatality/failure rate is for male circumcision, but I do know about the fatalities associated with pregnancy and childbirth, even today, and I do know about the fatalities associated with FMG.\nWhat do you think, Rich?\nIn closing, please note: some European countries are considering bans on male circumcision. This is very concerning for a couple of reasons: what about the health implications for women? and, since male circumcision is a religious requirement for minority Muslim and Jewish religions only, is this a form of religious persecution? Food for thought. Please see: The problem with Iceland\u2019s proposed ban on circumcision | EUROPP (lse.ac.uk)\nHere\u2019s a little more food for thought:\nReproductive Work and Male Privilege\nmedium.com\nFor more of the good stuff, follow Fourth Wave, where we\u2019re changing the world for the better, one story at a time.

So, why are women increasingly choosing to remain childless?\nThe Netflix series \u201cMaid\u201d provides some insight into this reasoning: single mother, Alex, turns to cleaning to make ends meet after escaping an abusive relationship, suffering homelessness and other setbacks as she strives to build a better life for herself (as a writer) and her daughter. The Will Smith movie, \u201cThe Secret of Happyness\u201d, although about a single father, provides further insight into the plight of single parents, especially in The Land of Opportunity, the USA, where the atrocious pay and benefits cause many to have to work at two or more jobs to make ends meet.\nUnfortunately, relationships break down all too often, and usually mothers take on parental responsibility for the children. Far too often, women are forced to flee abusive partners, sometimes sleeping in their cars with their children before obtaining refuge accommodation and governmental assistance in Australia. In the USA, it\u2019s a much more gruesome situation (see \u201cthe Kindness of Strangers\u201d, 2017) and too many women today are just not prepared to take that risk. Where women were once dependent upon having a husband to provide for them, today women achieve higher education, aspire for highly paid positions and financial security. Taking the chance on becoming a mother, with all the inherent risks regarding pregnancy, childbirth and relationships is simply not a risk they are prepared to take.\nAt age 70, I\u2019m old enough to remember when men and women could do exactly the same job, but the men were paid more, simply because they were men who probably had a wife and children to support. Never mind if a woman was widowed with children to support, or had an invalid husband! I remember when it was legal to fire women when they married, or when they became pregnant. I also remember when parents, usually, didn\u2019t provide tertiary education for their daughters because, usually, after they married they had children and didn\u2019t return to the workplace. I remember when single women could not get a home loan and when a wife\u2019s income was not taken into consideration in the couple\u2019s ability to repay their loan because \u201cwhat if you get pregnant?\u201d\nBack then it was, literally, \u201ca man\u2019s world\u201d. But things have changed. With reliable contraception, equal opportunities, access to higher education and, despite the glass ceiling, access to better paid jobs, women are far more likely to look at what motherhood has to offer them and decide that it\u2019s just not enough, given the risks involved. And this should be seen in a positive light: contributing to a reduction in the population; but it seems that certain interests are greatly threatened by this new womanly independence and refusal to be incubators and child nurturers. Because in many parts of the USA, women\u2019s rights to CHOOSE are being purposefully undermined and eroded.\nDespite the crucial need to massively reduce the world\u2019s population to prevent destruction of habitats and pollution of our air and waterways, the only country in the world to take their own overpopulation seriously \u2014 China \u2014 was condemned around the world, perhaps rightly so, given some of its methods. Although far less publicised, perhaps because India\u2019s government was not communist, their methods of enforced sterilisation were even more heavy handed.\nThe notion of ZPG \u2014 Zero Population Growth \u2014 took off in the late 60\u2019s, early 70\u2019s, when concern was first expressed about air pollution \u2014 two children per family was the unspoken ideal. But today, despite the catastrophic results of climate change due to pollution and deforestation, many families are having more than two children and nobody hears a whisper about ZPG.\nWhy?\nCould it be that, despite the amount of pollution and destruction of habitats that we see today as a result of rampant consumerism and planned obsolescence, there are those whose immediate best interests are not served by reducing the number of consumers and subsequently consumerism?\nAddressing just the aspect of the workforce, and considering the USA\u2019s appalling working conditions re pay and benefits, what will happen if there is a significant reduction in the pool of available workers? The law of supply and demand provides the answer: there will be increased competition for the available human resources and employers will be forced to be more competitive: in other words, improve pay and benefits. And that, of course, would reduce the profits to the owners of the means of production.\nFurther, if the population is significantly reduced, so is consumption, with the resultant decrease in profits.\nBut could this be the reason why the evangelicals are so determined to reduce women\u2019s rights to control their reproductive work? I don\u2019t think so.\nHistory provides the answer. Around the world, throughout history, birth control has been sought by men and women for numerous reasons. However, generally, abortion has been disapproved of, if not forbidden and illegal. Why? It\u2019s as simple as male privilege, male entitlement. Research into the history of abortion will tell you that usually it was because men didn\u2019t want women to have the right to abort \u201ctheir seed\u201d.\nPrivileged white males have been heard to pontificate: \u201cmoney should never be a reason for abortion\u201d. Really? Since money is necessary to feed, clothe, house, transport, educate, protect, provide medical attention, just how can we justify bringing children into sub-optimal conditions?\nThe Evangelists don\u2019t care. They just don\u2019t want women to have abortions.\nThey\u2019d prefer that every conception conclude in a live birth. What happens after the birth is of little import to them: adopt them, foster them, live in a cardboard box under a bridge with them, sell their bodies to perverts to support a drug or alcohol habit, just don\u2019t have an abortion.\nAnti-abortionists state their conviction that abortion is equivalent to murdering a human being, an act repugnant to them! Really? They don\u2019t seem to be terribly concerned about sending thousands of young people into foreign countries to die in wars in Korea, Viet Nam, Iraq and Afghanistan.\nThere is no doubt that enforced reproductive labour has been the lot of women for centuries. Why enforced? Because, generally, there wasn\u2019t a damned thing women could do about it.\nThen we have that little gem of a saying about women being \u201cbarefoot and pregnant\u201d. How did that little treasure come about? According to Wikipedia, it is \u201ca figure of speech most commonly associated with the idea that women should not work outside the home and should have many children during their reproductive years. \u201cThe phrase seems to have been introduced in the early twentieth century by the American doctor Arthur E Hertzler from Kansas who said \u2018When the wife is kept barefooted and pregnant there are no divorces.\u2019 By the mid-1900s, the phrase had passed into common parlance \u2026\u201d Read that again!\nSimone de Beauvoir stated, so very well: The oppressor would not be so strong if he did not have accomplices among the oppressed. No surprise then that the wives of privileged white Evangelical males appear to support their \u201cmen\u201d wholeheartedly, smilingly, whilst bringing up their children in the ways of privileged males and obedient females. Instead of fighting for the rights which they may not need, but some women DO, they turn their backs on their sisters in need, as they put their noses in the air at the perceived malodour of these sisters who, for whatever reason, wish to terminate a pregnancy. As Madeline Albright stated: There\u2019s a special place in hell for women who don\u2019t help other women.\nForced to leave an abusive marriage myself, with two pre-school children, I struggled to work, study, pay off a mortgage, pay for child care and provide the best I could for my children. For three years, I worked two jobs, six days a week. Deeply in love in a new relationship, I happily became pregnant again, only to find that he now regarded me as \u201ctrapped\u201d (his word) by the pregnancy, and began his own form of controlling abuse.\nBut I had learned a bitter lesson: unwilling to start over yet again with one more child to support, I chose abortion. I was not living in grinding poverty, I did not have substance dependency. I had skills with which to support my children. I was, however, completely alone, with almost no support and I had previously suffered deep depression with suicidal ideation. In my desire to role model what I believe was a productive and responsible lifestyle to my children, I worked hard, and I knew that my children missed out on quality times that other children enjoyed because of the pressures on me.\nI also knew that those pressures impacted my parenting at times, making me tired, grumpy and reactive: I would not bring another child into the situation, making it even harder on all of us. I was broken hearted, fearful for the future and completely disillusioned.\nI make no apology for my decision, rather, I steadfastly defend it. Nor do I regret my decision, and I tell my story because I refuse to be ashamed \u2014 no woman should be ashamed \u2014 of making a responsible, reasoned decision to ensure that she and her children have quality of life.\nMy feeling now is ANGER toward the privileged white male attitude that forced me to make that decision. The privileged white male attitude that saw me as \u201ctrapped\u201d by pregnancy with his child, dependent upon him to support me and my children, for at least some time, with no longer any say in how our lives would proceed, and no consideration for what I wanted for the children I already had.\nIt apparently hadn\u2019t occurred to him that I would not accept his control and domination, that with my past I would choose abortion rather than again be a vulnerable, dependent woman, fearful for the future of the children she brought into the world. I am convinced that this is why privileged white males are afraid: reliable contraception and abortion take away the control over women that pregnancy and motherhood previously gave them.\nI believe that many, if not most, abortions are about fear, even dread, of the future with vulnerable infants and other children to support, where there are just not enough safeguards and supports if we accept enforced reproductive labour.\nIf privileged white males want to be fathers, if society and governments want women to do reproductive labour, then ensure the changes that will make it safe, provide appropriate supports and benefits. Because now, we have the power to refuse to do reproductive labour, and we will. We\u2019ve left the Dark Ages behind, and we\u2019re not going back!\nFor more of the good stuff, follow Fourth Wave, where we\u2019re changing the world for the better, one story at a time.

The land war, however, would not be as effective or lethal were it not for Lukashenko providing a front along Belarus\u2019s southern border, not far from Ukraine\u2019s capital, Kyiv.\nIndeed, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky put it bluntly-Belarus is \u201c not neutral,\u201d he said-when weighing potential negotiations in the country\u2019s capital, Minsk. \u201cWarsaw, Bratislava, Budapest, Istanbul, Baku-we proposed all that to the Russian side,\u201d he said. \u201cAny other city would work for us, too, in a country from whose territory rockets are not being fired.\u201d Belarus is, in fact, far from neutral. It is complicit with the Russian attacks, and Zelensky has reckoned that any negotiations on its land would be on enemy territory.\nIt didn\u2019t have to be this way. Belarus was early roadkill on the path to Putin\u2019s widening Ukraine war. While the world\u2019s shocked attention is now understandably fixed on a besieged Ukraine, the people of Belarus long ago lost any real shot at their own independence. Lukashenko stole a recent presidential election, used lethal violence to put down popular dissent, surrendered the nation\u2019s sovereignty to Putin, and has since welcomed Russian troops to overrun and occupy the nation. The country has since become the most important staging area for an ongoing war against Russia\u2019s neighbors and NATO strongholds-all of it coordinated and conducted by Moscow. It looks and feels like a throwback to the days of the USSR.\nThere was a brief moment when Belarus, along with Ukraine and other former Soviet states, appeared to be on the verge of independence and political reform. An independent modern Ukraine painfully and painstakingly grew out of that moment and became an inconvenient fact for Putin and his hopes of reconstituting a Soviet-lite territorial Slavic Leviathan.\nIn Belarus, however, the independence movement and reformist moment were barely a blip; in fact, the same Communist boss who ruled with an iron fist shortly after the dissolution of the Soviet Union remains in place today. Lukashenko is one of the longest-running illegitimate leaders in the world, having climbed to power in 1994. He almost makes Putin look like an authoritarian slacker.\nBelarusian citizens pay the price for Lukashenko\u2019s power-grabbing impunity. The nation\u2019s economy is rated 45th out of 45 in Europe. The people\u2019s attempt to elect a legitimate leader was thwarted by a Lukashenko-driven suppression machine that aimed to kill, jail, disappear, crush, or cast out any opposition during last year\u2019s presidential referendum.\nIn a free election, Svetlana Tikhanovskaya would have had a real shot at victory when she ran for president in 2020. She became an opposition leader after her video blogger husband and erstwhile presidential candidate, Sergei Tikhanovsky, was capriciously arrested that year. He was tried and sentenced to 18 years in prison for doing what video bloggers do-pointing out political corruption and organizing for political change. Tikhanovskaya now lives in exile in Lithuania and tries to make her voice heard over the deafening sound of Putin\u2019s beating war drums in Ukraine.\nOn Sunday, in a Twitter video, she declared herself the national leader of Belarus-a move reminiscent in part of Venezuela\u2019s Juan Guiad\u00f3, who is currently recognized as the legitimate government representative by nearly 60 nations. It is highly unlikely she will be at the negotiating table representing Belarus anytime soon, but if the Putin-Lukashenko axis is defeated or overthrown, she may be first in the line of succession.\nFor now, however, Ukraine is subjected to a bloody invasion aided and abetted by Russian troops crossing the Belarus border. Many of the 45,000 Russian troops that were stationed in offensive positions throughout Belarus are on the move in Ukraine. Those Russian troops served as both a Belarusian occupying force and an assembled offensive corps poised to threaten Europe further.\nRussian forces made themselves at home in Belarus, operating in a quasi-recognized Russo-Belarusian \u201c Union State\u201d that effectively melded Minsk into a vassal capital of an aggressively muscle-flexing Putin-led Russian empire bristling with tanks, missiles, and cyberweapons. If those offensive conventional forces and digital tools aren\u2019t enough, not only did Putin\u2019s oversized mini-me leader in Minsk threaten to host nuclear weapons pointed at the West, he has now voted to allow Russian forces and nuclear weapons to be permanently based in Belarus.\nThis is perhaps the most dangerous move and moral affront to the civilized world. Amid Putin\u2019s war of choice, a new nuclear power has arrived on the international scene. Nuclear weapons are the most dangerous of armaments and effective of deterrents; they are the latest, greatest threat to peace and security. But the current hot war started a long time ago as a hybrid war against the West initiated by both Putin and Lukashenko.\nIndeed, a synchronized Minsk-Moscow hybrid assault on NATO member states Poland and the Baltics started a few years back-and has been steadily picking up steam. The weaponization of refugees last year was an early offensive assault on Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia. It was a cynical move that took advantage of desperate people and allowed Minsk to profit from human misery. The Putin-Lukashenko tag team leveraged a weak Western moment, and the poorly executed U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan further amplified the narrative of NATO division and decline. Moscow mocked the alliance as America tried to manage a peaceful end to its longest war-and as Washington\u2019s friends and allies felt abandoned.\nDuring this time, Minsk enticed migrants to buy one-way plane tickets to Belarus. Once there, they were shuttled to weak points on the European Union\u2019s borders, then pushed over the semi-permeable boundaries to plead for refuge. To add insult to injury, the Russians then set off a disinformation campaign to draw scorn from rights groups in Poland and the Baltic nations, whom Moscow depicted as not wanting to accept these vulnerable refugees.\nThe first shots fired in Putin\u2019s latest war were not just the cyberattacks beyond Belarus\u2019s borders, they were also the cynically sent shock troops made up of tired, poor, and huddled masses of men, women, and especially children. The younger the involuntarily conscripted people, the more effective the propaganda of pity. Twenty-four-hour news coverage of the ongoing assault on Ukraine brings steady streams of images of the new refugee class spilling into Poland and other Ukrainian border states. These people are being welcomed and accommodated for now, but the attackers are counting on the refugee flows toward the West to further destabilize NATO and the EU. Instead, they seem to have stiffened the resolve of these institutions and of the European citizenry.\nThis is the year that Putin\u2019s war on Europe aims to destroy a sovereign Ukraine and turn it into a more resource-rich subjugated nation-a bigger Belarus. For a man bent on survival, Putin seems to see the destruction he wreaks on this border nation as simply the cost of doing business. But such an action could sow the seeds of his demise.\nNATO, the EU, and most of the world are witnessing Ukrainian citizens\u2019 bravery and its leaders\u2019 resolve, and are answering the call for support and unity. Ukraine cannot become another Belarus.\nStill, over the last several weeks, as the world watched troop movements and listened to Moscow\u2019s disingenuous diplomacy, Putin pulled off a neat trick. He completed a task he had initiated only a few years earlier. He took over a pliant Belarus without firing a shot or raising a discordant voice in the international community. If he survives this moment, Putin\u2019s gambit will still result in him bringing one more nation into his irredentist game.

His 1969 Oscar-winning movie of that name starkly dramatized the 1963 murder of the Greek opposition leader Grigoris Lambrakis by right-wing extremists.\nProtests against both Lambrakis\u2019s murder and the sham trial that followed crystallized in the form of a letter: Z. Athenian buildings were spray-painted with Z graffiti; illegal gatherings throughout Greece were punctuated by loud cries of \u201cZ!\u201d When pronounced as z\u00e9e, the letter in Greek means \u201cHe lives.\u201d \u201cZ!\u201d was a raised fist of rebellion, and it also meant \u201cHope lives.\u201d\nNo more.\nIn Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia, with its perverse up-is-downism, the letter Z has been appropriated to represent ethnonationalist militarism, death, and destruction.\nUnsurprisingly, the Putin-led regime-which calls war a \u201cspecial military operation,\u201d decries Jews as Nazis, and shells civilians to \u201cdemilitarize\u201d Ukraine-is commandeering a Greco-Latin alphabetic letter. It is not the most criminal act of Putin\u2019s invasion, but it\u2019s a crime against morality and human compassion. Putin has deployed Orwellian \u201cNewspeak\u201d to assault history and corrupt Z \u2018s true meaning.\nIf Greece\u2019s Z was a subversive peace sign, inspiring survival against all odds, Russia\u2019s Z is an abbreviated war sign for hyper-violent military success. In Russian, means \u201cfor victory.\u201d The letter, no longer offering hope, represents death, and is meant to inspire fear.\nPutin\u2019s propagandists have spread Z-fever across Russia and the battlefield that is Ukraine. The letter is un-artfully painted on invading tanks and personnel carriers that tear into the Ukrainian countryside and rip up paved urban streets. Z has been stylized and weaponized to become an ostentatious display of support for the war. A bronze medal-winning Russian gymnast trolled the Ukrainian gold medalist next to him by wearing the Z on his chest as if he were some evil Superman. Social media is rife with videos of rallies scored with driving electric guitars where ruffians in black T-shirts with graphically battle-worn Zs are whipped into a bloodthirsty frenzy. The Putin Z has been added to place-names. Posing for photos at a hospice in the Russian city of Kazan, sick children were placed in a crooked line to form the letter.\nInterestingly, the letter Z does not exist in the Russian Cyrillic alphabet. The sound for Z does, but as it appears on war swag, the symbol has the appearance of a half-drawn swastika, a 1930s echo in the 2020s. The Russian war on Ukraine and its civilians is the cry of rape victims, the snap-crackle of bullets fired on bicycle-riding Ukrainian citizens, and the booming of bombs falling on maternity wards and theaters, marked as children\u2019s shelters in letters so large they\u2019re visible to any Russian pilot. It is a horrendous cacophony punctuated by moments of silent terror where bleeding bodies are left in debris, and barkless dogs walk by indifferently.\nUnlike Russia\u2019s Z, the Greek Z was a sign of reverence reserved for martyrs and heroes. It reminded those under the jackboot of the colonels\u2019 junta that time was ticking down for the military dictatorship. Hope was alive because Lambrakis\u2019s spirit \u201clives.\u201d The letter Z and the rebelliousness it represented were so threatening to the Greek junta leadership that the letter was banned.\nIt wasn\u2019t purged from the 24-letter alphabet or excised from typewriters, but it was illegal to write the letter alone or decontextualize it in any public forum. The military dictatorship also banned all 1960s and 1970s symbols of protest or leftist leanings. The following were made illegal: long hair, miniskirts, abortion, music by the Beatles, and anything written by the composer Mikis Theodorakis.\nTheodorakis was a Communist agitator, peace activist, and recipient of the International Lenin Peace Prize. He never stayed silent and wrote the pulsatingly driving soundtrack for the movie Z, as well as for Zorba the Greek and Serpico. His music was as incendiary as it was illegal, and he remained politically active until his death last year at the age of 96. His compositions were the soundtrack of Latin American liberation movements and still rouse mass rallies.\nIt was not just Theodorakis\u2019s music that was forbidden. As a vacationing Greek American, I once innocently played a popular Cretan folk tune that I\u2019d learned in my California home. It was a revolutionary song that I absent-mindedly noodled on my accordion while sitting in my grandparents\u2019 backyard in Chania. The first recognizable notes sent my family and neighbors within earshot into a panic as they raced to silence me, warning that someone would surely call the cops. They did show up, but my family explained that my simple rendition was not politically motivated but, rather, politically naive. Ignorance can be an excuse. Years later, as a UC Berkeley undergrad, I saw the movie Z on campus, and it catalyzed my political awakening.\nMovies, music, books, and even letters-cultural symbols and popular memes-possess the power to be politically subversive. Until 2022, the letter Z threatened dictatorships.\nNow Z is a perverted symbol, a MAGA-like representation of unquestioning support for Putin\u2019s war, which has sent more than 10 million Ukrainians fleeing their homes. Putin and his henchmen commit these premeditated atrocities, and now they have stolen my personal relationship with a letter, a Greek symbol of hope, and a global democratic movement.\nOriginally published at https://washingtonmonthly.com on April 27, 2022.", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 0, "created_time": 1651091985914, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Russia", "Ukraine", "War", "Peace", "Putin"]}, {"author": "Markos Kounalakis", "post_id": "61f9b1fb8c83", "user_id": "fdc3e69facb6", "title": "From Ukraine to Venezuela, people are fleeing their homes and becoming weaponized refugees", "content": "From Ukraine to Venezuela, people are fleeing their homes and becoming weaponized refugees\n\nBy Markos Kounalakis and Leopoldo L\u00f3pez Special to The Examiner\nRefugees are daily streaming over borders to neighboring countries and adding to what is already the world\u2019s largest refugee crisis. The country they are fleeing is embattled, violent and experiencing extreme shortages of medicine and food.\nThis is not Ukraine. It is Venezuela.\nWhile Ukraine is undergoing invasion, Venezuela continues to suffer erosion. In both cases, people seeking survival are fleeing these two countries. In Europe, they are escaping armed invaders and rocket attacks; in Latin America, they are rushing from societal collapse.\nThese two countries are different, but the conditions that have created their refugee crises can both be traced to Putin\u2019s Russia and a growing network of nations hostile to democracy. It is a coalition of the chilling and they form a new Axis of Autocracy.\nMade up of Russia\u2019s friends and facilitators \u2014 China, Iran, Turkey, Cuba, Nicaragua, Hungary, North Korea \u2014 their concerted and collective efforts may not always result in large refugee populations, but their coordinated work to undermine democratic systems is sophisticated and persistent.\nVenezuela has been a key target and member of this network. Just a couple of weeks ago, the United States sent the first high-level envoy to Caracas to break off Venezuela from this strategic Axis \u2026 and to get at Maduro\u2019s oil reserves. (It is unclear if the U.S. will accommodate the Venezuelan and Iranian regimes for cheaper gas prices. The jury is still out.)\nWhy is America trying now to wedge itself between Russia and Venezuela? In part because this Axis not only facilitates Russia\u2019s current invasion of Ukraine, but also because it supports the democratic and civilizational erosion of Venezuela. These two events may seem disparate, but in these instances they share similar outcomes: Millions of people leaving their homes.\nNearly 7 million refugees have fled the consecutive Venezuelan regimes of Hugo Chavez and Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. Venezuela is Americas\u2019 feeder nation of desperately fleeing people. The country has created impossible political, social and economic conditions, forcing reasonable people to take flight, mostly to neighboring Colombia and with many reaching the United States.\nOnce a wealthy nation in the Americas, an extraordinary oil producer that founded and led OPEC, Venezuela remains a political thorn in the side of the United States. It provides Putin international support and a safe haven for Russian security advisors and materiel, is a magnet for China\u2019s exploitive capital and leverages Turkey\u2019s active money laundering of \u201c blood gold.\u201d Further, along with Cuba and Nicaragua, it is a breeding ground and test site for anti-democratic forces throughout Latin America.\nThe international community must remain focused on Vladimir Putin\u2019s escalating war on Ukraine for the time being. Ukraine is in the early stages of a potentially much larger refugee crisis, with nearly 4 million people already fleeing to neighboring countries at the end of the Russian invasion\u2019s first week. They are escaping both an active war and a potential future foreign occupation.\nUkrainian refugee numbers will continue to swell as Russian military violence escalates, creating a host of problems for the people seeking refuge, their families and, of course, on the refugee-receiving countries. Up to 100,000 of them will be welcomed to the United States, with many finding their way to the San Francisco Bay Area to reunite with family. California has historically had the largest Ukrainian population in the U.S. and Governor Gavin Newsom says \u201cwe\u2019re a state of refuge.\u201d\nWar victims do not willingly leave their homes. In fact, they are systematically bombed and forced to flee Putin\u2019s advancing forces in order to construct a massively destabilizing force targeted at neighboring nations. Ukrainian refugees are weaponized hordes that descend on ill-prepared European nations. Poland is the main target right now. Laudably, the Polish people are mostly welcoming at this stage, but Putin is counting on the pressure these refugees will put on Warsaw and other host nations to weaken further their political structures and democratic will.\nWeaponized refugees are a tried-and-true tactic. As people stream out of affected nations, they crowd into neighboring nations, putting sudden and significant humanitarian and political pressure on the receiving nations. Turkey used this tactic to try to destabilize Greece and blackmail the European Union.\nAttempts by receiving nations to manage or stanch the flow of refugees invariably results in added danger and harrowing imagery. The targeted countries suffer the double burden of housing, feeding and caring for new arrivals \u2014 they also are subjected to international condemnation for not doing enough or accepting their share of refugees.\nOf course, this only seems to matter if there are graphic images and political attention paid to the plight of refugees. In too many parts of the world, the cameras have long ago turned away from the steady flows or intractable and never-ending surges of people on the move. Axis of Authoritarianism\u2019s nations seem never to suffer the gaze of an unblinking critical eye because they either distract it or violently blind it.\nVenezuela has contributed disproportionately over the years to the world\u2019s refugee population. Caracas has executed this unconscionable act in plain sight. The world\u2019s gaze is now necessarily aimed at Ukraine, but more nations may soon follow as will media and popular attention.\nIn the dynamically developing new world order, there must also be a new understanding of the weaponization of people. For Putin and his expanding Axis, weaponized refugees are now a feature, not a bug of war.\nMarkos Kounalakis is author of \u201cFreedom isn\u2019t Free: The Price of World Order\u201d and a visiting fellow at the Hoover Institution.

He saw the storm coming. It is now a Putin-driven hailstorm of rockets and bullets raining down on cities and civilians. Urban residents have gone from sheltering-in-place against COVID to picking up arms to fight in the streets. Europe is again embroiled in a war that will not end all wars.\nSan Francisco feels a million miles away from today\u2019s shooting and mayhem. Yet when Zelensky came to visit President Biden in September, he made a pilgrimage to America\u2019s largest Ukrainian community: California. He gave a critical speech warning of Russia\u2019s intentions at Stanford\u2019s FSI center, the academic home of Mike McFaul, the former U.S. ambassador to Russia.\nZelensky then jumped in a car and headed to Mountain View to visit the Adjutant General David S. Baldwin, to review the California National Guard at Moffett Field. I was there for much of Zelensky\u2019s time with my wife, Lt. Governor Eleni Kounalakis, and felt both the urgency of Zelensky\u2019s appeal and his ability to cajole and convince his hosts for the material support that the last presidential administration held hostage.\nLooking back at Zelensky\u2019s visit, I vividly recall F-15 fighter pilot Colonel Robert \u201cTigger\u201d Swertfager talking with the president about his time in Ukraine, as part of a cycling contingent of California National Guard who have trained with Ukrainians both here and in-country since 1993. The airman had maintained close personal ties with his Ukrainian pilot friends \u2014 there may have been drinking involved \u2014 and spoke of both their daring and the danger they faced. He then reached up to his shoulder and ripped from his flight suit a special patch, handing it to Zelensky.\nThe Ukrainian President touched the unique patch to his heart and said he would carry it with him always. When I see Zelensky now in an online video or sandbag-backed press conference, I think of the patch that likely is in his pocket. If the order comes, the California aviator would be among the first to enforce a no-fly zone over Ukraine. A no-fly zone over Ukraine, however, runs the risk of a wider war \u2014 one that would evolve into a Russia-NATO conflict and might trigger the use of tactical nuclear weapons that are at Putin\u2019s fingertips.\nAnyone watching the war on cable news channels knows that it is both far away and very close. We feel the immediacy; we are pained by the suffering of innocents. Eating dinner while viewing the growing stream of fleeing refugees to Poland and other bordering countries makes us feel grateful for our own peace and prosperity.\nThe juxtaposition of war abroad and peace at home creates for a schizophrenic present, for cognitive dissonance. America just pulled out of its longest war in Afghanistan \u2014 a war that was mostly out of sight and, for both citizens and political leaders, is now out of mind.\nUkraine is different. Not because it is a war against white Europeans who are dominantly Christians. It is different because it is being attacked by Putin\u2019s Evil Empire. He has sent the equivalent of the Death Star to descend on Kyiv, and the rebel forces are outnumbered and outgunned. But they are not out of luck or pluck; they are standing their ground.\nThe Taliban was outgunned and outmanned, too, but the U.S. was not going to enter into World War III to oppose the Taliban. Also, nuclear conflagration from Afghanistan was never a threat. Putin, on the other hand, is ready to pull the nuclear trigger.\nWe know this viscerally and we are all trying to understand what it means two weeks into the Russia-Ukraine war. We try to understand what it means to our daily lives, how it will change the geopolitical balance of power, whether we will be able to travel as easily or frequently as we once did to remote parts of the world.\nWars of this magnitude and consequence used to require significant citizen sacrifice. Gas going up 26 cents a gallon is an annoyance, but does not qualify as broad societal hardship. There are a few who recognize the gravity of the moment and have shipped off to Ukraine to fight in the International Brigade, a ragtag fighting force reminiscent of the American Lincoln Brigade that went to fight in the Spanish Civil War (for a refresher, read Hemingway).\nHow this war ends is unclear. Ideally, Russians rise up to remove their dangerous leader, who is in his 22nd year in power. As Putin walks through his gilded Kremlin corridors, he has become increasingly isolated and paranoid, aware that his future holds only three options: 1) power, 2) prison or 3) death.\nWhat can San Franciscans do? Lifelong Giants fans know how to root for an underdog. San Franciscans are showing blue and gold flag Zoom backdrops, sending aid and demonstrating publicly. We are rooting for Ukrainians, rooting for Zelensky. Because a loss for Ukraine will bring darkness to all, delivering a temporary but significant blow to freedom and democracy.\nMarkos Kounalakis is author of \u201cFreedom Isn\u2019t Free: The Price of World Order\u201d (Anthem, 2022) and a visiting fellow at the Hoover Institution.\nPutin knows Zelensky symbolizes hope and freedom and will do everything in his power to destroy him. Zelensky\u2019s survival means that democracy has another day of life. America is using sanctions and other tools short of direct confrontation with Russia or no-fly zones to save the nation. It must do everything it can to help President Zelensky and the people of Ukraine.\nOriginally published at https://www.sfexaminer.com on March 7, 2022.", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 1, "created_time": 1646719034970, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Democracy", "War", "Ukraine", "Russia", "California"]}, {"author": "Martin Barakov", "post_id": "b190fe8722b4", "user_id": "1a91f8b39753", "title": "The Rise of Social Imperialism in the 21st Century", "content": "The Rise of Social Imperialism in the 21st Century\nSocialism as an ideology is being discussed again throughout Western countries. It is also losing its meaning.\nThere has been a resurgence of socialism and its discourse in domestic North American and European politics. Individuals such as Bernie Sanders, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and other like-minded people are espousing the title of \u2018democratic socialist\u2019, alongside the advancement of a welfare state reliant on \u2014 of all things \u2014 capitalism. In Europe, a similar trend has occurred, especially after the collapse of state socialism in the turbulent years between 1989 and 1991. In the aftermath of introducing hyper-capitalism and Western European corporations into these new liberal-democratic states, the creation of new \u201csocialist\u201d parties occurred.\nMay Day in Madrid, Spain featuring a left-wing protestor. (Wikimedia Commons / CC BY-SA)\nIn Albania, there was the creation of the Socialist Party of Albania. In Bulgaria, there was the creation of the Bulgarian Socialist Party. In Hungary, there was the creation of the Hungarian Socialist Party. Similarly, Western European nations also have this odd conception, an example being the Socialist Party in France. The list goes on. There is one thing that these parties have in common, that predominantly being the mere adaptation of socialism to individuals and groups that seek nothing more than the progression of capitalism with a so-called \u2018human face\u2019. They are for nothing more than the advocacy of social democratic policies and the maintaining of the status quo.\nWhile Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez, the aforementioned European political parties, and other related individuals and groups consistently and consciously advocate social democracy under the guise and name of socialism, the development of a united working class \u2014 both domestically and internationally \u2014 is crushed slowly, but surely.\nThe reintroduction of socialism into public discourse after decades of continuous propaganda fueled by McCarthyism is of course, a positive development. However, its new representation has been conducted in arguably one of the worst ways possible, outside of direct fascism as seen in Germany and Italy in the prelude to World War II (and throughout as well).\nLenin and the Social Imperialists:\nThrough the works of Vladimir Lenin, specifically regarding his indispensable work on imperialism being the final stage of capitalism, there is a phrase that accurately describes the appropriation of both socialist ideology and the fight against imperialism by the masses. In Imperialism, the Final Stage of Capitalism, Lenin accurately depicts the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), as a party of social imperialism, representing the notion that they were \u201csocialists in words, imperialists in deeds\u201d.\nLenin proceeds to exclaim that the broad influence of the scholars and journalists, who are of a bourgeois nature, are doing nothing but defending imperialism in a relatively concealed manner as opposed to the more direct and overt supporters of dominant capitalism. The advocacy of reform, the ridiculous concept of changing the system from within, and other infantile notions are nothing short of the social imperialists of old, and they have consistently been present throughout the history of industrial capitalism, up until the present day.\nThe subtle influx of social imperialism through the guise of reintroducing socialism to the working class as part of a \u2018counter-culture\u2019 indeed has results with regards to the demystification of the word \u2018socialism\u2019, as well as other similar supposedly dangerous terminology. However, this is not at all to state that this is the correct approach to doing so. Anti-imperialist discourse and rhetoric has suffered as a result of the co-opting of socialism as a label. Rather than having in-depth discussions about how to stifle the militarized and economic efforts of the imperialists, the proletariat are stuck arguing about whether or not Bernie Sanders was right to call Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro \u201ca tyrant\u201d.\nRather than focusing on how to improve efforts within the imperialist core and beyond, we are stuck without a well-established revolutionary organization, oftentimes having to settle for the neoliberal candidates offered by the liberal-democratic parties that are oh-so-present throughout the world. While it is, of course, necessary to explain the foundation of socialism to those looking for a new perspective, a new answer to the faults of the present social, economic, and political orders throughout the world, it should not be the peak of political discourse between people, be it digitally or in person.\nThe notion that state-induced policies are socialist regardless of any context and substance whatsoever has led the public to perceive that the position of the military within a country like the United States is a \u2018socialist\u2019 conception. This is, of course, an extraordinarily destructive idea, seeing as how the military and its related organizations have been and are continuing to be the vicious and destructive arm of imperialism around the world. Of course, the same idea goes for police departments across the capitalist societies.\nIt is imperative to highlight that socialism, regardless of the sectarian divisions between socialists, is primarily concerned with the transition away from capitalism (and by extension, imperialism) and the development of an economy that deals with social and proletarian control over the means of production.\nAs much as the social democrats and their followers prefer to call themselves socialists for desiring the implementation of a universal healthcare system and other social and public goods, it does not correlate positively with the simple comprehension of workers controlling that which they use and produce. As long as the domination of imperialism through the function of capitalist combines and cartels exists and functions properly, capitalism obviously remains, and socialism is an ideology that has yet to be actualized.\nA French copy of Lenin\u2019s Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism from 1925. (L. Maitrier / CC BY-SA)\nAs mentioned earlier, the subtle arguments that are made in favour of imperialist tendencies by bourgeois academics, journalists, and others, directly leads to the public view that the individuals in question are not active supporters of imperialism, while the reality is that the opposite is true. For instance, arguing in favour of ravaging other independent nations for the portrayed purpose of a supposed understanding of liberation, freedom, or humanitarian need is not guided by the well-being of the proletariat of the nation(s) in question. Instead, it is through \u2014 yet another thin veil \u2014 the goal of conquest and domination. It is through the necessity for capitalist markets to expand on an infinite scale, the requirement of the division of the world \u2014 and subsequently \u2014 the labour it provides.\nSocial Democrats and the Justification of Capitalism:\nSince the beginning of Marxist socialist discourse, the scientific socialists and communists have argued against the utopian notions of bargaining, the subtle appeasement of the working class, and the sole implementation of reform, as per the comments provided in The Communist Manifesto by Marx and Friedrich Engels. It is not without reason that reformist tendencies have historically been frowned upon by revolutionaries around the world. The proceeding with the creation of a social safety net for the citizens of a specific country is \u2014 arguably \u2014 one of the core principles of social democracy, that is, the understanding that the function of capital, and by progression, capitalism and imperialism, is evil in nature.\nHowever, the conclusion that the social democrats arrive at is the passing of reforms through the proper channels such as parliaments, senates, and other liberal notions of governance. This is due to the interpretation of the social democrats that capitalism can be fixed, that is, that capitalism can be absolved of its inherent evils, its tendency to consume at whatever rate is deemed suitable by market forces and multinational corporations alike. Anti-imperialists have gone beyond these childish interpretations, acknowledging that the growth of capital and its collaboration with state agencies and modes of governance cannot be reformed, at least not to the extent that is required for and by the proletariat.\nIn addition to the false understanding of capitalism and its tendency to collapse over time, the social imperialists also deem themselves as the peaceful middle-ground, that is, the moderate political party, the party that will never dedicate themselves to a revolutionary situation or cause, nor any class struggle for that matter, as mere order is the ultimate desire by them.\nThis, in particular, was beyond evident during the time of the German Revolution of 1918\u20131919, in which the ruling party at the time, the SPD, under the leadership of Friedrich Ebert, recruited private military volunteers known as the Freikorps. This directly led to the destruction of the socialist uprising, ultimately resulting in the murder of famous revolutionaries Rosa Luxemburg, Karl Liebknecht, and other socialist sympathizers of the time.\nThe event created a strong and long lasting sense of distrust between the social democrats and the communists in the region and around the world, leading to the infighting that would occur in the leadup to Adolf Hitler\u2019s rise to power. Why is this relevant today? The social imperialists have never been on the side of revolution, as it is counter-imperative to their goals of securing only the most meager of gains for the working class through subtle reformist ideas.\nSpeaking of Luxemburg, her theoretical critique of reformism has, without a doubt, withstood the test of time, especially when taking into account the naivety of the notion of fixing capitalism. The idea that we should be tackling one issue at a time, one theme in society that needs to be addressed, is beyond foolish. Luxemburg states the following with regards to trade union activity (in England) in Reform or Revolution:\nTrade union action is reduced of necessity to the simple defence of already realised gains, and even that is becoming more and more difficult. Such is the general trend of things in our society. The counterpart of this tendency should be the development of the political side of the class struggle.\nIf applied to the modern function and practice of social imperialism, it is glaringly obvious that the reformist tactics are still, to this day, being employed consistently throughout liberal-democratic states. The act of fixing that which is deemed to be wrong, whether it be racism, homophobia, transphobia, religious divide, classist mentalities, and more, cannot be mended through the introduction of bills and other acts of legislation. In the words of Luxemburg, the counterpart of this form, this character, this sense of understanding of governance, is the \u201cdevelopment of the political side of the class struggle\u201d.\nThe direct interconnectivity between governmental actors, the political parties, the media, the military forces, all other similar entities, alongside the various industrial complexes routinely work together to ensure stability and order, even if it results in abhorrent conditions for the working class. It is impossible to eliminate the adversarial design of liberal capitalism through the system that it has established itself, or, in other words, it is impossible to stop a fire through the usage of gasoline.\nImperialism in the 21st Century:\nIn the 21st century, imperialism is as alive as ever, seeing the continuation of multifaceted capitalist economic crises, the ongoing growth of fascism as opposed to neoliberalism, the annihilation of entire countries through military means and economic warfare, and more. The social imperialists have little to offer to the global proletariat, presenting all but a few select crumbs from the entire loaf of bread, and only for the labour aristocracy living in the developed world. The gradual implementation of social democratic policies does not and will not suffice for the revolutionary fervor that is present throughout the walls of factories, the corn fields, the multinational retail stores, and other workplaces inhabited by proletarians.\nPhoto by Steve Harvey on Unsplash\nWe are living in the age of digital communications and what is, effectively, the next printing press. We live in the era of the internet and hyper consumption of information, whether we are aware of it or not. Ideology is all around us, and it is up to the masses, i.e. the working class, the proletariat, to break free not only from their chains to capital and the social and economic status-quo, but also from their false consciousness provided by simply existing within industrial and post-industrial society.\nWe have progressed from the times of reading the newspaper, listening in on the radio for thirty minutes at a time, and watching the daily news in the evening at the dinner table. Now, we are consistently fed news, information, propaganda, all at once when commuting, when leisurely browsing on a mobile device, or when watching any of the newly created 24-hour news channels on the television. We are consuming ideology at unprecedented levels, levels that have never been seen throughout history, and the impossibility of revolution and a society that differs from the same one that existed decades, upwards of centuries ago is ever present.\nOf course, with the arrival of ideology at a level of change never seen before, the progression of revolutionary momentum seems rather bleak. The rapid funnelling of false streams of consciousness into the minds of the proletariat, alongside the illusory notions of change that are presented by the social imperialists definitely provides an outlook that would only be described by any present-minded person as revolutionarily futile.\nBut this should not discourage any proletarian, not at all! Instead, the necessity for organization and collaboration between the working class is only made even more evident, and through the creation of the methods used to drown the masses with heightened senses of ideology, the same technology can too be used in a manner that progresses towards the inevitable, that is, the revolutionary stage.\nThe appropriation of socialism via the practice of social imperialism is just a political element of the constant consumption of ideology provided by the technological advancements and the steady maneuverability perpetuated by the capitalist superstructure within society. As such, the social imperialists of today who are gaining traction are simply providing a false sense of choice to those who are disenfranchised by already existing liberal politicians.\nThe slow degeneration of what is publicly perceived to be the \u2018left\u2019 within societies around the world, that is, the individuals and parties devoid of any class understanding and analysis and the advocacy of very liberal notions of intersectionality, are losing to the rise in far-right and neofascist ideology. We are seeing history repeat itself, but with newly created and developed social and material conditions around the ideologies in question.\nThe Hijack:\nThe hijacking and appropriation of socialism by the aforementioned third parties and related entities directly hurts the working class by being unable to provide a Marxist approach to the notion of proletarian collaboration and emancipation. In addition, the social imperialists are not comrades with those located in the Global South, rather, they are enemies through the direct application of imperialist arrangements, whether it be the passing of economic sanctions, the severing of ties given their country\u2019s left-leaning policies, or, at times, the full-scale invasion of entire countries.\nThe myth of popular unity with social democrats leads to the active destruction of the working class in the face of alternative modes of governance that people will inevitably resort to when the existing order collapses, as this is a premeditated outcome given the internal contradictions of capitalism. The reclaiming of socialism as the advocacy of proletarian-controlled management of the means of production is imperative to the progression towards a socialist society, as unlikely as it may seem in the present day. Likewise, the active distancing away from social imperialism is a fundamental stepping stone on the path towards providing a genuine alternative to neoliberal politics and the present state of American hegemony.\nMoving forward, the reestablishment of class consciousness within the proletariat is of the utmost importance. The critique of the social democrats should return to the mainstream, as it was once seen in Germany, in Russia, and other locations around the world. The anti-imperialist left and the broad working class should not succumb to the supposedly inclusionary tactics often employed by the social imperialists.\nThe concealment of discriminatory legislation, the support of the one-issue candidates, the usage of historical revolutionaries to peddle anti-revolutionary ideas, all of these and their related themes have been against the notion of proletarian governance, the emancipation of the working class, and the establishment of socialism. The hijacking of socialism in the 21st century is an ever present theme within discourse on the left, and the time to alter this course of history and return to revolutionary ground is every single day moving forward.", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 327, "created_time": 1594586899080, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Politics", "History", "Socialism", "Capitalism", "Theory"]}, {"author": "Martin Barakov", "post_id": "986ebd2ed2de", "user_id": "1a91f8b39753", "title": "Russia\u2019s Invasion of Ukraine & De-Communization Efforts", "content": "Russia\u2019s Invasion of Ukraine & De-Communization Efforts\nWith an ever-expanding NATO and a Russia poised to solidify its position in a world increasingly defined by multipolarity, the working class has suffered at the hands of competing capitalist interests.\nFollowing Russia\u2019s recognition of the Donetsk People\u2019s Republic (DPR) and Luhansk People\u2019s Republic (LPR), the declaration of a so-called \u201cspecial military operation\u201d in Ukraine occurred. Russian troops invaded from the Donbas in the east and Belarus in the north of the country on February 24, 2022. Contrary to the barrage of reports by mainstream news outlets, many were under the impression that a full-scale invasion was extremely improbable, myself included.\nA photo of the signing documentation concerning the recognition of the DPR & LPR. (Wikimedia Commons)\nRussian President Vladimir Putin, on claims of bringing about the \u201cdenazification of Ukraine\u201d, accelerated military conflict in the country by extending it to all other regions. Over the last eight years, the war had primarily been limited to the Donbas which originally came about via the overthrow of former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych and the subsequent declaration of independence by the DPR and LPR back in 2014. While that portion of the war was very much brought upon and continued by the conjoined imperialist and geopolitical desires of the United States and NATO, Russia\u2019s invasion marks a very grave and inexcusable escalation.\nIndeed, a diplomatic solution was and still remains the most important goal to ensuring an immediate cessation of conflict in the region. Moving towards enacting policy via warfare features no benefit for neither Russians nor Ukrainians, only bringing about more suffering and death. As has been the case with Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Yemen, and the plethora of other examples, it is impossible to overstate the tragedy of war and the immense loss of life that comes along with it.\nPutin\u2019s \u201chistory speech\u201d from February 21 focused greatly on the \u201cartificial\u201d creation of the Ukrainian nation-state, supposedly being orchestrated by Vladimir Lenin and the Bolsheviks. He referenced the revolutionary as having severed \u201cwhat is historically Russian land\u201d and doing it in a manner that imposed \u201cextremely harsh [conditions] on Russia\u201d. Furthermore, great emphasis was placed on the idea of de-communization, the process of post-Soviet and post-socialist states disengaging from their socialist histories, often to curtail and outright criminalize organizations and their activities:\n\u201cAnd today the \u201cgrateful progeny\u201d has overturned monuments to Lenin in Ukraine. They call it de-communization. You want de-communization? Very well, this suits us just fine. But why stop halfway? We are ready to show what real de-communizations would mean for Ukraine.\u201d\nPutin also noted the principles of self-determination that were made available by the revolutionary Soviet government were \u201cnot only a mistake, but far worse than a mistake\u201d, further emphasizing his opposition to these policy decisions undertaken by the USSR.\nTheoretical and practical anti-communism has done nothing for the general public within Eastern Europe and Central Asia. This process of \u2018de-communization\u2019 has great support among the liberal and conservative sectors of the former Eastern Bloc, criminalizing remnants of socialist and communist parties that still posed a threat to the newfound bourgeois economic order post-1991. Of course, this also extends to newer organizations that have been born in the years since.\nComparisons to Invasions by NATO & Humanitarian Information:\nAlmost instantly, comparisons were being made to historical examples of large-scale invasions and attacks on other countries, including Iraq, Yugoslavia, and others. Even on Going Underground, a show on Russia\u2019s state-run RT network, such comparisons were being made during a discussion with former Vice Chair of the Russian State Duma\u2019s International Affairs Committee, Natalya Narochnitskaya:\nAfshin Rattansi: \u201c\u2026why did Vladimir Putin say he wasn\u2019t going to invade, and what were all the Russian drills \u2014 military drills that occurred in Belarus and in Russia beforehand, while\u2026all assuring everyone there would be no invasion?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve heard that phrase, \u2018surgical strikes\u2019 and the language being used by the Russian side is like the language NATO used in Iraq, Libya, Syria, and Afghanistan, arguably. Again, [Antonio] Guterres said, \u2018they\u2019re not peacekeepers at all!\u2019 How can they be peacekeepers if civilians \u2014 Ukrainian civilians are dying? \u2026 We hear reports of civilians dead, and how can anyone trust what comes out of the Kremlin, given they said they were just [military] drills over the past few weeks, that he wouldn\u2019t invade, that he wasn\u2019t going to threaten Kyiv?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026is Moscow doing what Moscow has been accusing Washington of doing throughout this so-called Cold War?\u201d\nNarochnitskaya resorted to citing the Kremlin\u2019s much-stated notion of Western aggression and the failure to understand the security concerns of Russia, while also stating that \u201cRussia is becoming Washington only in one respect, in that it clearly declares of its national interests\u201d. Consistent references were made to Kosovo\u2019s declaration of independence in 2008, the severely fraudulent pretexts that the United States used to invade Iraq, and the serious concerns over the rise of ultranationalism and neo-Nazism in Ukraine.\nBut irrespective of any conversation taking place, war has extended far beyond the DPR and LPR. The two oblasts in the Donbas are mentioned here because \u2014 while some viewed a full-scale invasion as unlikely, or perhaps even outright stupid \u2014 the odds of a limited invasion seemed significantly higher.\nIn the domestic Russian context, any expectations of the war being \u201cpopularly supported\u201d were immediately shattered, with anti-war demonstrations emerging across the country, but especially in Moscow and St. Petersburg. Perhaps one of the main reasons for this revolves around the spontaneity of the actions being taken by the Russian government, with little to no public input on the potential impacts stemming from such a military escalation. Or maybe it has to do with a lack of public willingness to send the working class to die in a fraternal war, or maybe a bit of both.\nThe United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) has been routinely providing updates on the humanitarian situation in Ukraine. At the time of writing, over 1,000,000 people have fled the country, with at least 100,000 now being designated as internally displaced persons (IDPs). However, the latter is \u201cconsidered to be much higher\u201d than this initial estimate. A considerably high amount of damage to civilian infrastructure has also been noted in the report. The remarks shared here are based on published information as of March 3 at 15:00 (EET).\nThese developments come at a time after the conflict has already resulted in the deaths of over 14,000 people since 2014, according to Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba last year. According to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), approximately 12.5 percent of the inhabitants of Pervomaisk (Luhansk) remained in the city after intensified shelling by \u201cboth Ukrainian military forces and irregular armed forces\u201d and that \u201conly 30% of detached houses were [left] intact\u201d afterwards. This media report was released back in August 2014, close to the very beginning of the war.\nEffects of Sanctions on Life in Russia & Other Countries:\nSince the initial recognition of the DPR and LPR (and even beforehand), a push for sanctions to be imposed on Russia was at the forefront of political discourse in many Western countries, the only difference in mainstream political and media circles being how intense the sanctions themselves should be. Russian capitalists close to Putin and politicians were among the main targets.\nBut businesses and banks were also subject to sanctions by a wide variety of states, all promoted in the name of curtailing Russia\u2019s war and inflicting a series of economic punishments on Moscow. As with previous instances, Western states have used the act of imposing unilateral sanctions on countries as a means of deterring the actions (or perceived actions) being taken by their governments. This is often viewed as a supposed alternative to militaristic conflict, yet still featuring a strong degree of coercion being placed upon the country in question.\nSanctions being imposed on Russia are not new and their economic impacts have been well documented. In 2015 \u2014 one year after the annexation of Crimea \u2014 the Russian economy contracted 3.7 percent as per reports by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), while inflation was recorded as 15.5 percent. But this had little to no effect on cutting Russia\u2019s foreign policy objectives. Many attempts at \u2018overthrowing\u2019 or \u2018curtailing\u2019 a government via economic sanctions have failed, with the working class being affected the most.\nIn the context of Russia, this can be witnessed with the recent collapse of the rouble (RUB), going from just over 75 RUB for 1 USD on February 16 to over 110 RUB in the days after February 24. Contrary to previous iterations of sanctions being deployed, the United States and allied governments cut Russia off from SWIFT, the primary international messaging platform concerning cross-border payments. Naturally, this destruction of the currency has directly decimated whatever amount of money that Russians may have accumulated over time.\nJust as in the entirety of the post-Soviet and post-socialist world, economic catastrophe is not unknown or something new in Russia. The horrific effects of mass privatization and trade liberalization in the 1990s demonstrate this fact quite clearly. With this in mind, one cannot help but look at the comparisons between the collapse of the USSR and the incoming humanitarian effects of these sanctions. Many states have noted that these constraints are designed to place pressure against the financing of this invasion.\nRegardless of when this attack was initially planned, it is worth noting that the Russian government has been taking steps to safeguard against future sanctions, by building up the country\u2019s foreign reserves. The push to isolate Russia from having access to these reserves has derailed any possible assistance that they could have offered to the country\u2019s economy. The reality of Russians rushing to the banks is rooted in the demand for people to switch their increasingly-devalued roubles into other currencies, thus trying to minimize their losses.\nThe immediate deterioration of economic status for ordinary civilians has already been witnessed, with worse conditions expected to arrive in the coming weeks and months. The vanishing of savings overnight and intensified (expected) economic contraction are all part of these measures that are taking place, marking deeply worrying comparisons to the 1990s. Local spending power has already diminished significantly, threatening the ability for people to have access to necessary goods and services.\nSome have argued that the sanctions could usher in a new wave of civil unrest, ultimately leading to the collapse of the Russian government. However, similar logic has been used to try and get rid of the governments in Cuba, Iran, Venezuela, and more, only having completed part one of the plan: assisting greatly in the destruction of people\u2019s lives. These case studies offer great insight, as the governments in these countries have managed to retain power regardless of the sanctions employed against them.\nIran has suffered under the brunt of sanctions for decades now, with the country having been cut off from SWIFT in 2012 and again in 2019. Similarly, Cuba has faced the United States\u2019 brutal blockade for over 60 years at this point, resulting in significant economic hardship for the country. In the Venezuelan context, not only have sanctions been imposed on the country, but the recognition of Juan Guaid\u00f3\u2019s self-proclamation as so-called \u201cPresident\u201d has infringed upon the country\u2019s ability to access foreign reserves and properly conduct diplomatic affairs with other states.\nOn the Outcomes of Conflict:\nNaturally, it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to \u2018predict\u2019 what will happen next, especially since many did not expect this war to occur in the first place. Many questions need to be asked, including the following:\nWill Ukraine\u2019s government capitulate? If so, when and what does it mean?\nAre other actors going to get militarily involved? If so, in what capacity?\nWhat possible changes in military tactics can people expect?\nAre peace and ceasefire talks going to prevail or collapse?\nOf course, there are many more, but this relies solely upon speculation. When the conflict was limited to the Donbas, many had hopes that diplomatic efforts would prevail, that the provisions laid out by the Minsk agreement(s) would be followed and that hostilities would gradually come to a halt. None of this ended up happening.\nMany have been calling for increased militaristic action to take place, with journalists and politicians absurdly calling for the imposition of a no-fly zone over Ukraine to counter Russian aggression. This would inherently lead to a direct military confrontation between NATO and Russia, which can easily be translated into World War 3 (WW3). For now, many officials have ruled out such a possibility, including United States President Joe Biden, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, among others.\nAny further involvement by NATO or the United States in the internal affairs of Ukraine would certainly accelerate intensities, just as they have since the very beginning of this conflict. Russia\u2019s decision to invade was greatly motivated by the actions taken by NATO and the United States in earlier years, with both actors routinely failing to consider the security concerns of Russia.\nSome might dismiss this point as a \u2018pro-Russia\u2019 statement, but it is nothing short of the truth. Many of the most mainstream political scientists in the West have warned about this potential altercation for years and, in some cases, decades. At the time of the USSR\u2019s dissolution and the reunification of Germany, discourses and documents assuring then-General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev that NATO would not move further east were being generated by Western leaders and representatives. Some, (including current Secretary of State Antony Blinken) have argued that this claim is false, but researchers from the National Security Archive at George Washington University (GWU) have disagreed:\nWashington D.C., December 12, 2017 \u2014 U.S. Secretary of State James Baker\u2019s famous \u201cnot one inch eastward\u201d assurance about NATO expansion in his meeting with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev on February 9, 1990, was part of a cascade of assurances about Soviet security given by Western leaders to Gorbachev and other Soviet officials throughout the process of German unification in 1990 and on into 1991, according to declassified U.S., Soviet, German, British and French documents\u2026\nWithin several years, Czechia, Hungary, and Poland all joined the alliance, marking an end to the possibility of no further expansion. Since then, 11 other countries have joined, all within the former Eastern Bloc and Yugoslavia, with several other states aspiring to join as well \u2014 including Ukraine. Additionally, one cannot overlook the social element to NATO expansion either; NATO was designed as an anti-communist alliance set to deter the USSR and its allies after World War 2 (WW2). This is precisely why the Warsaw Pact was created a few years later. When the Warsaw Pact disbanded and the USSR fell apart in the early 1990s, NATO remained despite the perceived \u2018communist threat\u2019 no longer existing.\nSome view opposition to NATO expansion and existence as nothing more than an anti-imperialist ideological tenet, with multiple outlets going as far as vaguely understanding \u201ctankies\u201d as apologists for various governments, ranging from Putin\u2019s Russia to Hussein\u2019s Iraq and many states in between. This view is often introduced without any concrete examples from real-life events or practices, ultimately amounting to a criticism of a mentality that is mainly confined to individual circles on social media platforms. As already mentioned above, many analysts involved in American foreign policy hold a similar view:\n\u201cI think it is the beginning of a new cold war\u2026I think the Russians will gradually react quite adversely and it will affect their policies. I think it is a tragic mistake. There was no reason for this whatsoever. No one was threatening anybody else.\u201d\n\u2014 George Kennan, from a 1998 article in The New York Times\n\u201cFor years, [John] Mearsheimer has argued that the U.S., in pushing to expand NATO eastward and establishing friendly relations with Ukraine, has increased the likelihood of war between nuclear-armed powers and laid the groundwork for Vladimir Putin\u2019s aggressive position toward Ukraine.\u201d\n\u2014 The New Yorker regarding John Mearsheimer\u2019s views on the conflict\n\u201cIt would be extraordinarily difficult to expand Nato eastward without that action\u2019s being viewed by Russia as unfriendly. Even the most modest schemes would bring the alliance to the borders of the old Soviet Union. Some of the more ambitious versions would have the alliance virtually surround the Russian Federation itself.\u201d\n\u2014 Excerpt by Ted Galen Carpenter from 1994, as per The Guardian\nIt is important to mention that these figures view the conflict through very different lenses relative to anti-imperialists and some critical theorists, but the outcome is the same: continuously expanding NATO eventually results in war. Ukraine is an incredibly divided country. Seeking to place a dominant pro-Western or pro-Russian state in power would inherently result in a future conflict, just as we are seeing at the moment. Trying to create and then impose these state structures would naturally lead to civil unrest and the overthrow of a government, as 2014 has demonstrated quite well.\nThis is certainly part of the reasoning for a truly \u2018neutral\u2019 Ukraine in the present day when concerning geopolitical relations, although many of the avenues that could have been used to achieve this status have, in effect, been severed. The prospects of a stable Ukraine that comes out of this war are low.\nA \u2018forced neutrality\u2019 of sorts following an agreement to conditions laid out by Russia would certainly anger the already-powerful ultranationalists and fascist forces. This would very likely threaten political stability in the immediate post-war period \u2014 and especially if territory is officially ceded, be it in regards to Crimea or the Donbas.\nOn the other hand, a long-term continuation of this war and a rejection of peace offers would not only result in a drawn-out bombing campaign, but continued artificial ethnolinguistic resentment between Russians and Ukrainians. Certainly, this would give more ideological ammunition to nationalist forces on both sides.\nA third option includes the deposing of the Zelensky administration, thus amounting to either a power vacuum or a Russian-led regime change effort. Needless to say, none of these options provide any sense of possible stability.\nOne of the core geopolitical concerns of Russia that has been stated time and time again is the complete elimination of any possibility of Ukraine joining NATO. While many politicians and representatives from NATO have noted that this is an \u201cimpossible\u201d and non-arguable condition, it does stand as a method of preventing further bloodshed.\nIronically enough, Russia\u2019s main concern about NATO expansionism will only be exacerbated now, with the Russian invasion having given a green light to support even further militarization of countries across Europe by NATO. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has already committed to \u201cthe largest rearmament programme since the end of the Second World War\u201d and more states are inclined towards joining the alliance now, including Finland and Sweden.\nThe Disappearance of Socialism & the Necessity for Peace:\nSince 1991, the former Eastern Bloc has undergone a major political and economic transformation, and this is extremely true in the context of the aforementioned \u201cde-communization\u201d reforms that have been taken. As such, the socialist movements in these countries have been largely relegated to near-extinction, with the majority of parties transforming into so-called \u2018socialist\u2019 organizations that are virtually indistinguishable from other political parties involved in the bourgeois-democratic process. Examples include the following:\nThe Party of Labour of Albania (PPSh) turning into the Socialist Party of Albania (PS)\nThe Bulgarian Communist Party (BKP) turning into the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP)\nThe Hungarian Socialist Workers\u2019 Party (MSZMP) turning into the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP)\nWhile the working class is being strangulated by militaristic and economic means, defence contractors and other multinationals are intensely growing their profits. This is by no means limited to this conflict either, with stock prices for companies like Lockheed Martin and Raytheon going up practically every time there is a discussion around yet another war occurring or a possible increase in the United States\u2019 military budget.\nWith these workers\u2019 movements being criminalized and actively suppressed by new administrations, there is little organization to be found, alongside widespread feelings of despair and hopelessness. The socialist nostalgia that many often speak of is limited predominantly to those who lived during the USSR, its subsequent collapse, and the aftermath involved, and often does not resonate with the younger generations. That being said, the deteriorating material conditions in both countries \u2014 while through different means \u2014 will certainly aggravate the greatly-afflicted working class.\nThe ability for new organizations and a widespread movement to reemerge in the post-Soviet world is further constrained by artificial conditions of illegality imposed upon previously-existing parties and organizations. The aforementioned de-communization laws in Ukraine resulted in the \u201cban of communist symbols\u201d and the subsequent banning of the Communist Party of Ukraine (KPU) due to the promotion of \u201cseparatism and inter-ethnic conflict\u201d after 2014. Similar measures have been taken in other countries as well, including but not limited to Kazakhstan, Lithuania, and Poland.\nIn the context of Russia, one cannot forget the constitutional crisis in 1993 between then-President Boris Yeltsin and the Russian parliament, to which Yeltsin responded by dissolving both the Supreme Soviet and the Congress of People\u2019s Deputies. This was followed up by shelling the White House in Moscow while also authorizing the military to confront the pro-parliament protestors, resulting in as many as 187 deaths and hundreds more injured. This was immediately combined with the banning and suppression of socialist organizations and newspapers after the attack on the parliament.\nThe main causes for the protests were directly related to the deterioration in living conditions and the negative impacts of economic liberalization reforms on the general public. As such, it is not surprising to note that Yeltsin \u2014 who appointed Putin as Prime Minister in 1999 \u2014 continues to remain as one of the most unpopular leaders in modern Russian history, with his approval rating having dropped to an abysmally low 2 percent by the time he resigned in the same year.\nWhile these measures have greatly infringed upon the abilities of the working class to construct a large-scale revolutionary socialist movement, it has not dissuaded people from marching against the war itself, despite the threat of persecution. Thousands of people in Russia have been arrested for voicing opposition to the war effort. Naturally, the push for a return to diplomacy and some semblance of peace is not an unpopular opinion.\nThe OCHA noted that the most pressing matter is facilitating \u201clocal efforts to evacuate people living in affected areas\u201d. Luckily, the negotiations happening in Belarus have reached a conclusion in which such corridors will be created.\nUnfortunately, even with these measures, the discrimination concerning migration into neighboring countries has been extreme. Many non-Ukrainian civilians have faced issues with boarding trains and being granted entry into neighboring countries, especially when regarding the Polish-Ukrainian border. In particular, students from India and African countries have reported racist practices, noting the policy of allowing Ukrainians to exit first and being routinely cycled through the long lines at border crossings.\nCivilian safety and security \u2014 something that has been wholly undermined over the last eight years, but especially now \u2014 is one very crucial step regarding a shift towards establishing some degree of peace in Ukraine.\nRussia\u2019s move to attack Ukraine has been catastrophic for the general public in both countries \u2014 as war and its byproducts tend to be. That being said, the lack of a successful diplomatic approach combined with continued NATO expansion has simultaneously paved much of the road to this invasion. While a lasting peace and long-term cessation of conflict is the primary goal, this must also be accompanied by the continued reconstruction of a movement of the masses that is rooted in ever-present class divisions and opposition to nationalist idealism on both fronts.", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 44, "created_time": 1646081973198, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Politics", "World", "Russia", "Ukraine", "History"]}, {"author": "Martin Barakov", "post_id": "6ab4b1a62d7d", "user_id": "1a91f8b39753", "title": "Ukrainian Diversity & Russian Recognition of Donbas Breakaway States", "content": "Ukrainian Diversity & Russian Recognition of Donbas Breakaway States\nUnderstanding the recognition of the two breakaway states in the context of a heavily divided Ukraine and increasingly fractured attempts at de-escalation.\nOn February 21, 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin stated in a televised address that the country now recognizes the Donetsk People\u2019s Republic (DPR) and the Luhansk People\u2019s Republic (LPR) as independent and sovereign nations. Before the announcement itself, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz were made aware of the move by Putin to sign a decree of recognition, with the two leaders expressing \u201ctheir disappointment with this development\u201d, according to Moscow.\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during a meeting with Dutch PM Mark Rutte. (Wikimedia Commons)\nMany have stated that the ongoing tensions concerning the Donbas region (which comprises of the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts) have their roots in Euromaidan back in 2013 and 2014. It is a fact that Euromaidan was viewed similarly to other colour revolutions that had occurred around the world previously. This included placing great emphasis on Western-backed NGOs, economic liberalization, and a young population eager for political change.\nIndeed, Euromaidan did start via the desire to further establish ties to the European Union (EU), but it was most certainly not an event that featured an even remotely \u201cprogressive\u201d uniformity of sorts. In fact, some of the most important entities involved in pushing Euromaidan forward were far-right groups rooted in a fierce anti-communist ideological background, a glorification of historical Nazi collaborationist efforts, and a generalized anti-Russian sentiment. Through the portrayal of the movement as one of a \u2018liberal-democratic\u2019 and \u2018pro-Western\u2019 character, Ukraine has been able to move closer to the EU (and, perhaps more importantly, NATO).\nAs already mentioned above, it is impossible to boil Euromaidan down to a uniform movement that enjoyed widespread popular support, especially because it is simply not true. While the West was lionizing the supposedly liberal movement, the domestic situation was increasingly highlighted by fascist mobs gaining traction, prompting Russia to become more involved post-Maidan. For instance, the annexation of Crimea was, at least partially, built upon the concerns of Ukrainian ultra-nationalism becoming entrenched within post-Victor Yanukovych governments.\nIn the months after Euromaidan succeeded, there was a push for diplomatic efforts to prosper in the context of the newly-established and self-proclaimed DPR and LPR. These would culminate in the Minsk Accords (2014) and Minsk II (2015), both of which have effectively failed to halt the deteriorating situation in the country. The stories of the ultranationalist threat and anti-Maidan counter-protests witnessed outside of Kyiv (especially in the east and in Odessa) were actively ignored by Western actors \u2014 most notably the United States. The portrayal of united liberal-democratic actors standing up to the authoritarianism of Yanukovych continued without much fuss.\nMinsk was designed to not only introduce a much-needed ceasefire and gradual de-escalation, but also required Ukraine to pursue a process of decentralization regarding state power and its distribution. Regional autonomy was at the centre of discourse surrounding Minsk, but this remains nothing more than a pipe-dream, with all post-Maidan governments consistently failing to incorporate the agreed-upon resolutions. To an extent, this can be attributed to the nationalists\u2019 perception and revulsion of Minsk and the demands involved.\nThere is also the divisive concern of potential NATO membership for Ukraine, something that Russia has consistently railed against due to the proximity of Ukraine to Russian borders. Some have attempted to quell these concerns with the idea that NATO membership requires a flourishing democratic state apparatus and relative domestic stability, both of which Ukraine does not have presently and is unlikely to have any time soon.\nWhile these statements make sense when looking at admission requirements on paper, they run contrary to reality and historical precedents that have been set. For example, the fifth enlargement of NATO (2004) included countries such as Bulgaria and Romania, two former Eastern Bloc states that have been marred by high-level corruption and feature relatively poor applications of liberal-democratic political processes.\nMore recently, there was the ascension of Montenegro and North Macedonia to the organization, despite the two countries \u2014 even by Western standards of \u201cquantifying\u201d democracy \u2014 being considered \u201chybrid\u201d regimes (as per Freedom House metrics). Ukraine is identified as being part of the same category.\nUkraine\u2019s failure to adhere to Minsk \u2014 alongside the turning of a blind eye by the United States and its key allies \u2014 has directly coincided with the ongoing conflict and increased assertiveness of Russia. Indeed, Ukraine must now grapple with its long-existing comprador bourgeoisie, the renewed rise of ultranationalism, increased territorial loss and heightened ethnic division, NATO expansionists in the West, and Russian actions in the East.\nUnfortunately, all of this is also placed in the context of another failed post-Soviet transition to a free-market economy, with the country still not having achieved 1990 GDP levels, falling significantly below other former Eastern Bloc states like Czechia, Poland, Russia, and even Belarus. Of course, this is directly tied to Euromaidan and the outbreak of war in the Donbas region, but it is important to mention regardless.\nSome have proposed a return to a \u2018buffer state\u2019 status between Russia and the West \u2014 similar to what existed under some pre-Maidan governments and the situation that Finland finds itself in. However, it can be easily argued that the country is too removed from such a possibility, with almost a decade of local warfare and territorial disintegration. When this context is added to the recent recognition of the DPR and LPR as independent nations by Russia, it becomes even more of a utopian vision than before.\nIt is worth noting that a full-scale invasion of Ukraine by Russia remains an unlikely scenario, contrary to the continuation of media outlets pointing to a supposed impending invasion of the country and, for example, a supposed \u201cblitz on Kyiv\u201d. Putin has sent troops to the DPR and LPR as part of a \u201cpeacekeeping operation\u201d, according to an article by Reuters.\nThis is because while tensions are still high and Minsk has effectively been burned to the ground, the focus is still fully centred on Donbas. Building on the aforementioned poor economic situation of Ukraine, the plan for Nord Stream 2 directly hurts the prospects of Ukraine\u2019s status as a transitory country that connects Russian gas to the rest of Europe. Indeed, the United States does not particularly desire a European continent that is so intimately connected with Russia and with one of its most important exports.\nSome, including Ukrainian sociologist Volodymyr Ishchenko, have noted that it is not necessarily the pro-Russian breakaway states or even Russia that the United States wants to target in particular. Rather, they are more occupied with Germany (a crucial ally in NATO) and the potential for success with the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, something that would hinder the economic control that the United States wishes to have over much of Europe.\nArguably, the most important thing to take into account when looking at the domestic situation in Ukraine is to note that the country is not united behind the image of a pro-Western neoliberal political movement (nor was it in 2014). To use Ishchenko\u2019s words, ordinary Ukrainians are far more concerned with questions regarding their material livelihoods, namely \u201cthe questions of jobs, wages, and prices\u201d for goods and services, not \u201cidentity, language, geopolitical relations, the EU, Russia, and NATO\u201d.", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 14, "created_time": 1645475211082, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Politics", "World", "Ukraine", "Russia", "History"]}, {"author": "Martin Barakov", "post_id": "908156bbbd18", "user_id": "1a91f8b39753", "title": "On the Coverage of Russia-Ukraine Relations & the Possibility of War", "content": "On the Coverage of Russia-Ukraine Relations & the Possibility of War\nContrary to the hysterical desires pushed by mainstream media outlets and the manufacturing of consent, the prospects of Russia invading Ukraine are rather low despite high tensions.\nIn recent weeks, a wide variety of dominant news outlets have taken to reporting on the deteriorating relationship between Russia and the United States over Ukraine. This has ranged between the prospects of NATO expanding further eastward and Russia maneuvering its own troops within its own borders. Via the conducting of military exercises inside its territory, these same outlets are speaking of a supposed impending invasion of Ukraine.\nSergey Lavrov (left) and Antony Blinken (right) in Geneva, Switzerland in January 2022. (Wikimedia Commons)\nFor example, headlines from some of the most popular news outlets in the United States and its allies actively parrot this exact idea of an unstoppable crisis that will ultimately result in war in Ukraine due to perceived Russian aggression. The following are some of the most egregious recent examples of such sentiments being exhibited:\nPutin is Threatening a War. Are Russians Willing to Fight It? (Politico)\nWhy Russia\u2019s Ukraine aggression matters to Americans (CNN)\nUkraine tension: Biden says he thinks Putin will \u2018move in\u2019 (BBC)\nRussia could be on the brink of invading Ukraine. Here\u2019s what might happen next (CBC)\nUS vows \u2018swift, severe and united response\u2019 if Russia invades Ukraine (The Guardian)\nNaturally, there are far too many headlines of a similar nature to cover in this one article, but the point still stands: there is a strong belief among the news media in the West that Russia will be invading Ukraine momentarily. But such claims are not unheard of in the Russian context. For years, there have been \u2018worries\u2019 over Russia seeking to invade Ukraine and either annex the country, take over the Russian-speaking territories, or install a \u2018puppet\u2019 regime of sorts.\nBut even the Ukrainian government itself has raised serious questions about how many governments in the West have gone about understanding Russian military exercises. Comments made by several Ukrainian authorities were covered in a recent article by The New York Times:\nAlready this week, Ukraine\u2019s defense minister has asserted that there had been no change in the Russian forces compared with a buildup in the spring; the head of the national security council accused some Western countries and news media outlets of overstating the danger for geopolitical purposes; and a Foreign Ministry spokesman took a swipe at the United States and Britain for pulling the families of diplomats from their embassies in Kyiv, saying they had acted prematurely.\nIn fact, recent articles published in the same outlets previously mentioned (among others) have actively pushed for the United States to take actions that would result in a greater possibility of war breaking out. This includes increasing the amount of military support being given, deploying more troops in the region, accelerating sanctions against figures involved (including Russian President Vladimir Putin himself), and more.\nThese measures and trends are by no means limited to Russia either, with other countries classified as \u2018enemies\u2019 or \u2018rogue states\u2019 being subject to a near-identical sort of treatment. When Saddam Hussein in Iraq was infamously accused of having acquired weapons of mass destruction (WMDs), there were immediate concerns over the threat of warfare across the Western world, ultimately culminating in the brutal invasion of the country by the United States and a variety of its allies.\nWho Is Allowed to Conduct Military Exercises?\nAs mentioned above, the main issue deals with the United States being worried over the fact that Russia had decided to move its own troops within its own borders but relatively close to Ukraine. This was what sparked the initial reaction and supposed possibility of a full-scale military invasion of Ukraine by Russia.\nOn the other hand, if the United States exports its own troops, bases, and equipment to countries that have a physical border with Russia, there is no likelihood of war occurring, despite posing a far greater threat than the previous example. At the moment, Russia has a border with a total of 5 states that are members of NATO, those being Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, and Poland. If Ukraine were to join the organization, then that number increases to 6, with the country holding the longest border with Russia.\nBut there is no outcry over such facts existing or when the United States conducts drills and builds bases in these same countries. Nor was there any outcry a few months ago when Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States entered a new military pact called AUKUS with the stated intent of addressing \u201cboth the current strategic environment in the region [Indo-Pacific] and how it may evolve\u201d, according to statements made by United States President Joe Biden.\nOf course, the pact has nothing to do with ensuring the sanctity of the Indo-Pacific and everything to do with trying to come up with ways to deter and derail China from exercising its power in the region. Supporting Ukraine and calling for further Western involvement in Eastern Europe has a similar effect, but in the context of curtailing Russia instead.\nSuch a poor double standard is usually never questioned and for obvious reasons; if the neutral waters surrounding the United States featured Russian submarines on one side and Chinese submarines on the other, the country would find itself in a state of utter shock. When the USSR placed nuclear missiles in Cuba (as a direct response to American actions in Greece and Turkey), we got what most in the West refer to as the Cuban Missile Crisis!\nAll Eyes On Whom?\nNot only does this type of alarmist reporting hurt journalism itself and whatever integrity the discipline has left \u2014 at least in the context of the mainstream \u2014 but it is well documented that it directly affects public opinion, whether for better or for worse. Over the last 20 years, a select few countries have been actively viewed as the greatest threats to American national security at differing points in time. These primarily revolve around China, the DPRK, Iran, and Russia.\nInterestingly enough, when the United States public views one country as far \u2018more\u2019 of a threat than the others, it directly coincides with that same country receiving far more negative coverage in most mainstream outlets. It does not matter if the issue is the trade war with China, the further militarization of Eastern Europe, a new test of nuclear capabilities by the DPRK, or Iran and Venezuela circumventing barbarous sanctions. The American public rarely has equal coverage of all official \u2018enemies\u2019 of the American government, with the news media instead shifting towards emphasizing one in particular and then another after enough time has passed.\nFor instance, Russia was viewed as the United States\u2019 greatest enemy by a mere 2 percent back in February 2008, according to a Gallup poll. That number has skyrocketed to 26 percent as of February 2021. Furthermore, the number will likely increase due to the current reporting on Russia and Ukraine. Combine new members of NATO emerging in the region within this very same time period and Russia becoming increasingly surrounded by these members and it is entirely unsurprising that tensions are rather high.\nUnfortunately, such a dynamic results in militaristic measures being undertaken by all sides \u2014 with the United States heavily supporting Ukraine and Russia feeling the need to combat such encroachment by the West. One action leads to another and effectively results in the continued worsening of tensions, with the West (in particular) failing to consider the legitimate concerns of Russia regarding an even further expansion of NATO via Ukraine or any other country for that matter.\nRecently, the United States took to using the term \u201clethal aid\u201d when noting the militaristic assistance being granted to Ukraine. It is akin to how terminology has been consistently changing in an attempt to make inherently violent measures seem more \u2018human-like\u2019 or not as threatening. Granted, the concept of \u201clethal aid\u201d is not particularly new or limited to Ukraine, but its continued utilization by both the United States government and the news media is still deeply worrying.\nAnother interesting example was the intensely-covered trade war between China and the United States, specifically under the Trump administration. In February 2020, 22 percent of people believed that China was the greatest enemy of the United States. That number more than doubled to 45 percent exactly one year later in 2021, according to another poll conducted by Gallup.\nIs War Really Imminent in Ukraine?\nIt is undeniable that tensions between the countries are high, but to envision a war breaking out as a direct result of perceived Russian aggression in the region is very difficult. In fact, the only real concern of war breaking out is coming from countries like the United States, as Ukraine has stated that war is not imminent alongside the consistent denial of a possible invasion by Russia itself.\nRussia\u2019s Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergey Lavrov openly denied allegations of the country planning to conduct a false-flag operation of sorts, stating that the accusation is \u201ctotal disinformation\u201d. Similarly, the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergei Ryabkov echoed this sentiment, stating that Russia does not \u201cintend to take any aggressive steps\u201d and that the country has \u201cno intention of attacking, staging an offensive on or invading Ukraine\u201d, according to an article by The Guardian.\nThat being said, as long as NATO exists and continues growing in the same manner as it has since the end of the Cold War, the risk of war will remain. Indeed, NATO\u2019s original purpose \u2014 that being to counteract the threat posed by international socialism to the security of Western imperialist powers \u2014 no longer exists.\nAs a result, NATO now only seeks to exert its own power upon smaller nations, whether that be through bombing campaigns (Libya, Yugoslavia, etc.) or incorporating post-socialist neoliberal client states (the Baltics, Bulgaria, Romania, the Visegr\u00e1d Group, etc.) into the alliance. These additions serve to further place added pressure towards the borders of Russia, something that would be extended if Ukraine is to join in the future.\nThrough the elimination of provocative moves in the region \u2014 including but not limited to NATO expansion and sending \u201clethal aid\u201d to Ukraine \u2014 de-escalation becomes a very likely outcome. While these sorts of moves are technically possible, they are unlikely due to the desire for the United States to maintain its presence and dominance in the region. This is exacerbated when combined with the lack of an organized international anti-imperialist movement that is active in the area. In addition, the push for war by the aforementioned news outlets is relatively unaffected by individual policy changes, as their obsession with war is a deeply entrenched concept that goes back decades, if not more than a century in some individual cases.", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 56, "created_time": 1643141724220, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Politics", "Government", "World", "War", "Eastern Europe"]}, {"author": "Amanda Kay Oaks", "post_id": "186862dfde66", "user_id": "ee1bf3578b2f", "title": "Did You Know Netflix Has a Book Club?", "content": "Did You Know Netflix Has a Book Club?\nIt launched in November 2021, so why am I just now hearing about this?\nScreenshot from the Netflix Book Club website, taken by me\nOn October 13th, 2021, Netflix announced a new project to launch in November \u2014 the Netflix Book Club. As a semi-professional book nerd, I consider myself relatively well plugged-in to book news, and yet\u2026 I didn\u2019t hear a thing about this until a banner ad on Goodreads caught my eye today, four months and four book-to-screen picks later.\nA quick note on the name \u201cbook club\u201d for ventures like this. I think the term, originally referring to a group of people gathering together to discuss a book or books, has become increasingly diluted in recent years thanks to the possibilities granted by the internet.\nI am all for nontraditional ways to connect around books, but I wonder if a series of videos discussing books that Netflix has adapted to the screen can really be called a book club, when I see no clear attempt at a community/conversational element that goes both ways? It\u2019s an interesting experiment and I am tentitively here for it, don\u2019t get me wrong. Yet \u2026 a book club it may not quite be.\nBut I digress. Let\u2019s get to the basic info about what, exactly, the Netflix book club is, since I\u2019m making the tacit assumption that you, too, might not have heard of it yet.\nThe website\u2019s tagline is a short, sweet, and to the point \u201cRead. Watch. Then let\u2019s talk!\u201d In essence, Netflix has tagged actress Uzo Aduba to host a series of monthly book selections (all adapted or soon-to-be adapted for the screen by Netflix, of course). The book club landing page opens with a quick letter from Uzo herself, including the following snippet:\n\u201cBut don\u2019t get it twisted: This is not your average book club. No homework, no obligations, and definitely no have-tos. Whether you\u2019ve already finished the book or are waiting to read it once you\u2019ve watched it first, that\u2019s up to you! We repeat: There is no wrong answer.\u201d\nI\u2019m glad we all agree this doesn\u2019t fit the typical \u201cbook club\u201d definition.\nThe main conversation around the monthly picks is a behind-the-scenes video which, according to Netflix\u2019s press release, include conversations with the casts and creators of adaptations, as well as the authors of the original texts. All of this is set over the backdrop of a cup of coffee (Starbucks co-sponsors the endeavor).\nThe full video titles tend to read something along the lines of \u201chow x was adapted from book to Netflix\u201d which I think highlights the fact that this book club is focused on the adaptations and process, not necessarily discussing the book itself. This angle makes sense, given the Netflix of it all.\nThese videos appear on Netflix\u2019s YouTube and social channels rather than the streaming giant itself, for\u2026 reasons? I assume this is to make it feel more social, since YouTube and Facebook allow for comments, whereas Netflix itself does not. Yet I think this probably contributes to the fact that I\u2019ve managed not to hear about this at all until now. Slap a banner on the homepage and I\u2019m there, Netflix, but I\u2019m afraid we are not friends on Facebook.\nIn all, I\u2019m not entirely surprised to see Netflix take a stab at an online book club adjacent-experiment in this age of book-to-screen adpatations. If done well, this could be an interesting series for readers who enjoy breaking down the book-to-screen adaptation process.\nNetflix Book Club\u2019s website is visually appealing but a bit tricky to navigate, and it took me a minute to find the list of picks-to-date. Eventually, though, I clicked my way to learn that, thus far, the Netflix Book Club has featured Passing by Nella Larson, Stay Close by Harlan Coben, Sweet Magnolies by Robert Harling, and the most recent pick, The Viscount Who Loved Me in preparation for Bridgerton\u2019s second season.\nI haven\u2019t read any of these picks thus far, so I confess I\u2019m not exactly itching for a behind-the-scenes look at how these adaptations came to life (I did, however, check out the trailer).\nIn all, I\u2019m not sure what to think about the latest nontraditional book club to hit the interwebs, but it\u2019s certainly piqued my interest.

I just couldn\u2019t get myself to care about the characters or what happened, yet was curious enough to see how the lies would blow up in Birdy\u2019s face that I made myself keep going.\nI did feel a spark of interest as we got to the final chapters, which I then finished quite quickly. Ultimately, not a favorite or a recommendation from me.\nCurrent Reads\nI picked up a copy of Ruby Warrington\u2019s Material Girl, Mystical World because I loved the bright cover, used to subscribe to her magazine, and because it was available on Book Outlet. With a title like that (I don\u2019t really identify as a \u201cmaterial girl\u201d even if I do love stuff), I wasn\u2019t quite sure what to expect. But I am loving this book.\nIt\u2019s written in a down-to-earth approachable tone that I find really compelling, and I\u2019m flying through it. There\u2019s just enough self in the book to make it feel personal, but also plenty of practical knowledge for the spiritually curious. Even though I\u2019ve read many a Witch 101-style book by now, Warrington has explained a few things in ways that really helped them click for me like they haven\u2019t before. This is particularly true of the section on astrology, a subject which still intimidates me.\nI\u2019ve also started one of my NetGalley titles, Sari, not Sari. I am just flying through this romance about a woman who runs a company that specializes in helping people break up with their significant others \u2014 for good.\nI love watching people connect with parts of themselves they haven\u2019t explored before, so being along for the ride while Manny tries to learn more about her Indian heritage is very compelling for me. The love story has barely gotten going yet and I\u2019m 75% of the way through so I do wonder if this will be another \u201chmm is this actually primarily a romance?\u201d title for me. But, time will tell!\nUp Next & On to You\nWhatever I throw in my bag when I head off to the honeymoon will be my next read! I\u2019m just going to take whatever appeals to me from my TBR stack and NetGalley shelves and read what I want, when I want during the trip. Hopefully some photos of my books around the fancy lodge where we\u2019re staying will pop up on my Bookstagram and around the blog soon.\nWhat have you been reading this week, book friends?

Naturally, when I heard that author Ali Hazelwood had some new novellas coming out while we wait for her second novel, Love on the Brain, I was pretty excited.\nThe STEMinist novella trio was released in three installments, one book per month, starting in February of this year. They came out initially as Audible exclusives, though each title does have a future ebook publication date lined up. After I listened to the first one, I decided to hold my review for one Super Review after reading all three books. Since the last one released on April 5th and I remembered to listen to it last week, we have arrived at review o\u2019clock.\nFirst, a little info. The three books in the STEMinist novella series are:\nUnder One Roof (Released February 8th, 2022) \u2014 a forced proximity, enemies to lovers story about environmental engineer Mara and her thesis advisor\u2019s nephew, Liam.\nStuck with You (Released March 8th, 2022) \u2014 a\u2026 forced proximity, enemies to lovers story about civil engineer/soccer enthusiast Sadie and fellow soccer enthusiast/CEO of rival firm, Erik.\nBelow Zero (Released April 5th, 2022) \u2014 a life or death rescue mission slash enemies to lovers (light) story about aerospace engineer Hannah and Mara\u2019s hot NASA engineer cousin-or-something, Ian.\nThe books follow the love stories of three friends, Mara, Sadie, and Hannah, in that order. The trio met in grad school and are now out in the world at their STEM-related jobs, pursuing their passions at work and in their romances. As noted in my summaries above, all three have some element of enemies-to-lovers, which is probably one reason why these books fell a little flat for me, since that\u2019s a hard trope to sell me on.\nWhat I Liked\nThe stories each have their cute moments of banter between the couples, and it\u2019s clear why each one is drawn together. The pairs have more than just chemistry between them, and Hazelwood goes to lengths to show us in a short time where the common interests and passions lie for each leading couple.\nThe cameos by the other girls in each story are fun ways to flash forward and see where the protagonists of earlier books wind up, and to hear about them from a different perspective.\nThey\u2019re easy to read, being rather short, at a little under 4 hours each on audio. Aside from one notable exception that I\u2019ll discuss below, structuring the novellas between past and present helped Hazelwood cover a bit more time than the length would otherwise allow, which was a smart move that helped develop relationships a bit more.\nWhat I Didn\u2019t Like\nFor such a short story, starting Under One Roof with a steamy scene only to flash back felt like a confusing choice for me personally. I genuinely thought my file was corrupted when the book started because it felt like such a random place to start. That particular scene was awkward even when we returned to it after our flash back leading up to the moment. In this first book particularly, I felt very distinctly like something had been missed in revision, because characters referenced events that did not seem to have occurred in this final draft.\nAcross the board, it was difficult for me personally to buy in to the enemies-to-lovers gig with so little time to build up either the enemies or the lovers aspects. This trope is a hard sell for me anyway, and it definitely doesn\u2019t work for me as a novella when I don\u2019t really get to know both characters as well as I\u2019d like.\nThere was also a bit of insta-love, particularly in Stuck With You and Below Zero. The characters were very invested in their relationships rather quickly, often in the initial meeting, and that was a bit difficult to buy in how it played out in the story, particular with Below Zero.\nFinally, the steamy bits. This is 100% personal preference (most book opinions are, really), but the steam to relationship development ratios felt off to me. I\u2019m a slow build girl all the way and having several steamy scenes in a 4 hour audiobook left me wanting more. More banter and more sense of the relationship outside the physical elements, that is.\nIn all, these books were fine, and I don\u2019t regret reading them, but they didn\u2019t quite hit the same level as The Love Hypothesis for me personally. I got the sense that these were produced in a bit of a rush to capitalize on Hazelwood\u2019s virality after her debut, and this resulted in some sloppiness at the revision stage (see: references to things that appear to have been cut out).\nDoes this mean I\u2019m not stoked for her next book? No, it does not. I have faith that Love on the Brain will be an excellent return to form and am still looking forward to it.\nI would recommend the STEMinist novellas if you\u2019re looking for a quick, cute read and aren\u2019t bothered by some corner cutting in the relationship building department. Bonus if you\u2019re an enemies-to-lovers fan and like a lot of steam in your love stories.", "comment_count": 1, "like_count": 100, "created_time": 1650919754136, "comment": [{"user_id": "ee1bf3578b2f", "comment_time": 1650919754136, "comment": "Thank you for sharing!"}, {"user_id": "82ef0dd5fcf7", "comment_time": 1651005466918, "comment": "I like the idea of women in STEM as main characters in romance, what a great juxtaposition!

This romantic comedy adventure stars Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum, with Daniel Radcliffe as our zany villain, and I would happily sit myself down to watch pretty much anything with those credentials.\nAnd yet\u2026 when I first saw the trailer, I remember thinking it was a bit strange that the return of rom coms to the theater has, thus far, looked pretty darn familiar. Sandra Bullock and Jennier Lopez were the leading women when I was growing up, and I\u2019ve seen them fall in love many a time. Ditto Owen Wilson and Channing Tatum.\nGrowing up, I adored romantic comedies and would watch movies like The Princess Diaries, 27 Dresses, and She\u2019s The Man on repeat. When I arrived to my college dorm, I had He\u2019s Just Not That Into You in tow and yes I did demand that my new friends watch it with me the moment I learned they hadn\u2019t seen it.\nIn spite of this lifelong devotion to the romantic comedy genre, I didn\u2019t rush out to see Marry Me when it was released. In fact, I still haven\u2019t seen it. At every mention of this film\u2019s release, I felt weirdly guilty about not throwing my dollars at a ticket, as if it was my job to let Hollywood know they should keep on making rom coms.\nBecause obviously the return of rom coms to the big screen was what my inner heart had been dreaming of\u2026 wasn\u2019t it?\nOne night after I watched Spider-Man 3 for the third time and sat through the credits for a glimpse of Scarlet Witch in the Multiverse of Madness trailer, a thought occurred to me. Do I want rom coms back? Have I even actually missed them?\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m not here to talk down on these delightful films or suggest we shouldn\u2019t bring them back (in bigger, better, more diverse and complex versions, of course). But I\u2019ve begun to wonder, just a little, if a younger me would\u2019ve loved rom coms quite so much if there had been other female-driven stories on the table.\nThrough most of my formative years, if I wanted to go to the theater and see a story that I knew would center women (however problematic and stereotypical that portrayal might be), there was really only one reliable way to be sure \u2014 go see a romantic comedy. And go I did, until the heyday of theatrical rom coms gave way to the superhero trend.\nThankfully, the women didn\u2019t disappear with the rom coms. At least, not entirely. Instead, representation of female characters in other genres slowly but surely improved. In superhero movies, we went from the damsel in distress Mary Jane Watson to a Pepper Potts with a bit more agency (though, as the assistant to and love interest of our real star), until at last we found ourselves with Wonder Woman herself on the big screen.\nAnd then one afternoon, I sat in a theater as the credits rolled on Captain Marvel having the most unexpected thought. I was glad she hadn\u2019t fallen in love by the end.\nFor so much of my previous movie consuming life, a film without a love story, however thinly drawn, couldn\u2019t hold my interest. Yet there I was walking out of the theater satisfied from just watching a woman kick ass and discover who she is and aspires to be.\nI think that was the first time I considered why I grew up loving romantic comedies so much. Sure, I love a happy ending as much as anyone, but if watching Ocean\u2019s 8 and The Spy Who Dumped Me taught me anything, it\u2019s that maybe I value funny stories about women being their badass selves as much as, if not more than, Happily Ever After.\nTo be honest, I half-dragged myself to see The Lost City because I felt that I should want to. And a part of me did. What\u2019s not to love about the phenomenal cast and wacky premise? But another part of me wondered if the movie had anything new to offer me. It didn\u2019t, unless you count the realization that I\u2019ve wound up alone in the theater every time I\u2019ve gone to see any movie starring Daniel Radcliffe film since he stopped playing the boy wizard.\nThe Lost City was a fun movie, with all the beats you want in an action adventure romantic comedy. And yet, it didn\u2019t quite hit me where the rom coms used to. There are so many options for me to see women as the centers of their own stories now, and the rom com is such familiar ground, particularly when even the casting stays the same. I\u2019m sure it doesn\u2019t hurt that I\u2019ve reached the end of my own romantic comedy arc unless, heaven forbid, someone gives me one of those awful sequels with manufactured problems for the leading couple.\nPerhaps, now that I have them, I\u2019m more interested in the other stories in which women can play an active role. I\u2019m still a romantic at heart, and I won\u2019t stop seeing rom coms any time soon, but I am glad that today we have so many other options out there. After all, not every woman\u2019s story is about falling in love, and even if we do look forward to that moment, that\u2019s certainly not all that we are or aspire to be.", "comment_count": 7, "like_count": 498, "created_time": 1650409330606, "comment": [{"user_id": "ee1bf3578b2f", "comment_time": 1650409330606, "comment": "Thank you for sharing!"}, {"user_id": "ba5eaff7844a", "comment_time": 1650721599340, "comment": "I agree it's great to see better roles for women in general these days. :)"}, {"user_id": "1256cf978433", "comment_time": 1650821769238, "comment": "This is spot-on!

The CPI is the most widely used measure of inflation.\nThe full report is 37 pages long. I reviewed it and summarize it in plain English here.\nWhat Does CPI mean?\nThe CPI measures the prices that individual people who lives in cities across the U.S. pay for a range of goods and services, including such as transportation, food, and medical care.\nThe data is taken from a body of people representing 93% of the population of the U.S. It is obtained from 75 different urban areas across the country.\nThe full report compares prices against the prior month and the prior year. It also explores inflation in different cities across the U.S. and takes a deep dive into different products and services.\nI did a full explainer on inflation after the April 2021 inflation report. A lot has changed since then!\nAnnual Inflation\nGraphic courtesy of Tradingeconomics.com\nAnnual inflation figures are the average prices of February 2022 compared to February 2021.\nOverall prices went up 7.9% annually. The January 2022 annual inflation figure was 7.5%. The February inflation figures are the highest increase since January 1982.\nHere are the three broad categories: (January 2022 numbers are in parentheses):\n\nEnergy inflation: 25.6% (was 27%)\nFood inflation: 7.9% (was 7%)\nCore inflation : 6.4% (was 6%)\nHere is the annual inflation on some individual items randomly selected:\nCoffee: 10.5%\nCitrus Fruits: 16.2%\nGasoline: 38%\nCar & Truck Rental: 24.3%\nBuying Used Cars & Trucks: 41.2%\nSmartphones (for a brief look on the bright side): -13.2%\nHow bad is this level of inflation? Let\u2019s compare it to what it is supposed to be.\nThe central bank of the U.S. is the Federal Reserve, and is also known as the Fed. Since 1996, the Fed\u2019s monetary policy is aimed at making inflation about 2%.\nHow Does Your City Compare?\nSource: Bureau of Labor Statistics\nData from New York, Chicago and Los Angeles metro areas is recorded monthly. The data from the other eleven (11) metro areas listed here were part of the February report.\nAs you can see Phoenix (10.9%), Atlanta (10.6%), Miami (9.8%) and Baltimore (9.3%) had the highest inflation numbers, while New York (5.2%) and San Francisco (5.1%) had the percent increases.\nData from another nine (9) metro areas were last reported in January and will be part of the March report. These are Boston, Dallas, Denver, Minneapolis, Riverside (California), San Diego, Tampa, Urban Hawaii and Washington, DC.\nThe highest inflation figures from the metro areas who last reported in January were Tampa (9.6%), Riverside, California (8.6%) and San Diego 8.2%.\nThe lowest inflation figures from the January group were Washington, DC and Urban Hawaii (6%) followed by Boston (6.3%).\nMonthly Inflation\nThe report also measures monthly price increases.\nFebruary 2022 prices against January 2022 prices. January 2022 figures shown here are compared against December 2021.\nOverall Inflation\nFebruary: 0.8%\nJanuary: 0.6%\nFood\nFebruary: 1.0%\nJanuary: 0.9%\nEnergy\nFebruary: 3.5%\nJanuary: 0.9%\nCore Inflation\nFebruary: 0.5%\nJanuary: 0.6%\nIn other words, since last month, price inflation for all items outside of food and energy slowed down, while food inflation slightly increased. Energy inflation skyrocketed.\nEnergy indirectly affects all other prices too. Food and other items usually have to be flown in an airplane, driven in a car or transported on a ship to get to their final destination. Food is often cooked using natural gas in a restaurant or before going to a store.\nFor a deep dive into supply, demand and energy inflation, read this.\nBased on the above data, I am projecting that inflation is going to increase again in March, and depending on how long the Russian invasion of Ukraine lasts, inflation could continue to get worse before it gets better.\nIf you enjoy reading stories like these and want to support me as a writer, consider signing up to become a Medium member.

This seems to be because:\nThe local article covering this was written in French.\nThere seems to be very little information online and on Wikipedia about the structure of the government of the Central African Republic, so at first it was difficult to confirm the details.\nConflicting articles were written by different media outlets.\nThe News Cycle\nIt all started on April 23, when a headline from Forbes Monaco covered this, stating: \u201cFirst African Country Adopts Bitcoin Currency.\u201d\nHowever, this was not picked up by the Forbes main site, nor other U.S. mainstream financial news outlets such as Bloomberg, CNBC or the Wall Street Journal.\nI excitedly announced it on Twitter, and almost had to eat crow:\n\nOne of the largest crypto media sites, CoinTelegraph, did cover the news but was a bit more cautious in their headline: \u201cThe Central African Republic reportedly passes a bill to regulate crypto use\u201d.\nOne news website even contested that it was false and tried to throw Forbes and CoinTelegraph under the bus.\nFinally, this got cleared up today as Bitcoin Magazine and other major news outlets reported on this massively bullish news.\nIt is now clear that two separate events occurred:\nOn April 23, the National Assembly voted in favor of the bill.\nOn April 27, President Faustin Archange signed the bill into law.\nThis is massive \u2014 following El Salvador, the Central African Republic is the 2nd nation to officially add Bitcoin as legal tender.\nSo now what? Let\u2019s take a look at this nation and see how this move changes the game.\nCentral African Republic\n\nThe Central African Republic (C.A.R.) is rich in natural resources such as minerals, uranium, crude oil, gold, diamonds, cobalt, lumber, hydropower and has large quantities of arable (good for farming) land, per the CIA World Factbook.\nDespite this, it is ranked among the poorest ten countries in the world in multiple world rankings. Annual GDP per capita is 4th worst in the world, at under $1,000 per person, according to World Population Review.\nTo make matters worse, unlike most countries, C.A.R. doesn\u2019t even have a central bank and their own currency. A former French colony, they still are under financial control by the Treasury Department of France through the CFA Franc.\nBased on their economic situation, it seems that their government officials are not satisfied with the Bank of France\u2019s services.\nThe CFA Franc\nThe CFA franc is the currency for these 14 African nations, which happen to be some of the poorest in Africa:\nBenin\nBurkina Faso\nGuinea-Bissau\nIvory Coast\nMali\nNiger\nSenegal\nTogo\nCameroon\nCentral African Republic\nChad\nEquatorial Guinea\nGabon\nRepublic of the Congo\nThe CFA franc is a currency that was created in 1945 and is backed and controlled by the French Treasury and Bank of France. Originally pegged to the franc, It is now pegged to the Euro at a rate of 655.96 francs per one Euro.\nWhat\u2019s the trade-off? In return, France controls 50% of their foreign exchange reserves. On a personal level, if you are an American and you send another American a bankwire, it goes via the bankwire system which is controlled by the Fed.\nIf you are in any of these countries, the currency and digital banking network it goes via and is controlled by the Bank of France.\nExtreme poverty is one reason to look for alternatives.\nBitcoin\nC.A.R. lawmakers unanimously approved a bill legalizing the use of cryptocurrencies in the country and making bitcoin and the CFA franc legal tender. President Faustin Archange Touadera then signed the measure into law, his chief of staff Obed Namsio said in a statement.\nThe C.A.R. \u201cis the first country in Africa to adopt bitcoin as legal tender,\u201d Namsio said. \u201cThis move places the Central African Republic on the map of the world\u2019s boldest and most visionary countries.\u201d\nThis statement was posted on the President\u2019s Facebook account:\n\nThe bill has one aim to establish a favorable environment for the financial sector that meets the needs of the profession and all economic actors. Another aim of the bill is to establish a legal structure to regulate cryptocurrency and the crypto-related businesses like exchanges.\nThe Minister of Digital Economy, Gourna Zacko highlighted the economic independence the country and individuals can now experience for the first time:\n\u201cWith crypto-currency, there is no more control of the Central Bank. You have your money, you send to an investor for a business, you receive it in any currency, you can dispose with it in Dollar, Euro, CFA, or Naira\u201d.\nConclusion\nTo say that this is bullish news is a massive understatement. Zoom out and consider the geopolitical and macroeconomic situation on our planet.\nAs nation states flex their censorship muscle, smaller nation states will look to decentralized alternatives. Individuals will look to decentralized alternatives as well. Bitcoin is a logical solution for many third world nations and for many individuals seeking financial freedom.\nThe C.A.R. was the second nation-state to adopt bitcoin as legal tender. It will not be the last.\nNow consider the limited supply of bitcoin: 21 million. In fact, it\u2019s even less than that if you take into consideration an estimated 3.7 million lost bitcoin that will never be recovered.\nWhat\u2019s my investment strategy regarding bitcoin?\nBitcoin crushed every other asset class in the past decade, and it will crush every other asset class in the next decade.\n\u2026\nIf you enjoy reading stories like these, consider signing up to become a Medium member.

I want to first start with my immediate impression.\nBitcoin IS here to stay.\nHere is a snapshot the economy of just a single, albeit the largest, bitcoin conference, which is just a small part of the global \u201cbitcoin economy\u201d. Bitcoin 2022 was attended by:\n25,000 attendees\n400 sponsors\n3,000 companies\nMiami Mayor Francis Suarez unveiled an electronic bitcoin bull at the Miami Beach Convention Center.\nBitcoin 2022 was just one of at least half a dozen blockchain events THAT WEEK.\nBoots on the Ground\nAs a convention attendee for the second year in a row, here are a few observations.\n1. Networking. My main purpose in Miami was networking, which I did a lot of. I came a day early and attended the final day of Shitcoin 2022. I also attended an after party for four straight nights, after the main convention days were over. When I went home, my legs were sore, my voice was hoarse, and I had 150 new business cards. I accomplished what I consider to be two kinds of networking: a) targeted networking and b) accidental networking.\nIn terms of targeted networking, I met a number of thought leaders in the crypto and bitcoin space that I wanted to meet, including my good friend, fellow Medium writer and associate at Quantum Economics, Mr. Jason Deane.\n\nI met at least two dozen more internet friends of mine, most of them for the first time. It\u2019s great to see people in real life who you normally just interact with on Twitter. I was really impressed with so many of them.\nContrary to the ridiculous New York Post headline, I found that my bitcoin friends weren\u2019t psychopaths, and they did care about me!\nAs Miss Teen Crypto told me \u201cwow, you\u2019re a real person!\u201d Here\u2019s a shot of us hanging, too.\n\nAs far as accidental networking, aside from the 150 business cards I collected, I made several crucial industry contacts that are already helping me in my career \u2014 and I literally met them while taking a seat to have a breather and a snack.\n2. Venue\nThe Bitcoin Magazine conference crew did an excellent job with the venue this year. On contrast, while I enjoyed the conference last year, it was a disaster in comparison. They hosted 10,000+ people in an event venue likely capable of housing 5,000.\nThese changes allowed the 25,000 bitcoiners to attend in relative comfort:\nThe conference moved from Mana Wynwood (a much smaller venue) to the Miami Beach Convention Center.\nThe dates were moved from June to April, mitigating the worst of sweltering Miami summer heat.\nNo 3-hour sign-in lines in 90 degree heat.\nThe main conference stage was massive and there were no lines to get in, and there were always available seats.\nNo 30-minute wait for the bathroom or food trucks.\n3. Learning at the Conference itself\nThis year\u2019s seminars updated me on the latest events and conservations on bitcoin mining, bitcoin in politics and global bitcoin adoption.\nI enjoyed a number of the speakers at the conference itself, though admittedly I did miss quite a bit.\nSome of the speakers and moderators that stuck out the most to me included Jordan Peterson, Michael Saylor, Peter Thiel, Nic Carter, Steve Barbour and Mackenzie Sigalos.\nI noticed that there was a very broad range of speaker from all political spectrums, each embracing bitcoin from their own unique perspectives.\n4. The Bad Part\nThere was an extremely small percentage of women attending, and one of the staff of Bitcoin Magazine actually took pictures of one female crypto\u2019s butt and was posting this across Twitter, getting others to make fun of her. He was at least fired, though the CEO of Bitcoin Magazine was a little weak on the public response. He commented on these actions in a negative way, but did not issue an apology to this influencer.\nI had another friend of mine tell me if was odd that so many men weren\u2019t looking her in the eye, while I saw a few others complaining of verbal harassment.\nI am one of the last people to harp on this issue, but this conference needs to be more friendly and welcoming to women. While I am sure most men who attended are gentlemen, the few bad apples can ruin the entire environment. Anyone involved in the deliberate harassment of others should not be welcome, and wouldn\u2019t be at any conference I was be putting on!\nConclusion\nThe sheer size and growth of the Bitcoin Conference is a sign of the strength of community growth and network strength around the world. After all, this was one conference in Miami, Florida. It did have attendees from all over, but the vast majority were Americans.\nEven though Bitcoin\u2019s price had a sizeable drop during the conference (as is tradition!), as a result of that weekend in Miami, I can\u2019t help but be even more bullish about the future of bitcoin!\n\u2026\nIf you enjoy reading stories like these, consider signing up to become a Medium member.

But first, here\u2019s a quick intro on the terms:\nWhat is Ethereum?\nLaunched in 2015, Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain which specializes in smart contract functionality enabling it to be a functional platform for decentralized applications. Ether (ETH) is the native cryptocurrency of the platform. Among cryptocurrencies, Ether is second only to Bitcoin (BTC) in market capitalization.\nWhat is DeFi?\nDecentralized finance (DeFi) is an emerging financial technology utilizing blockchain technology. The system removes the control banks and institutions have on money, financial products, and financial services. Instead the decentralized system is controlled by pre-determined smart contracts.\nSome of the key attractions of DeFi for many consumers are:\nIt eliminates the fees that banks and other financial companies charge for using their services.\nYou hold your money in a secure digital wallet instead of keeping it in a bank.\nAnyone with an internet connection can use it without needing approval.\nYou can transfer funds in seconds and minutes.\nWhat is TVL?\nTotal value locked (TVL) is the sum of all cryptocurrencies staked, loaned, deposited in a pool, or used for other financial actions across all of DeFi.\nWithout further ado, here are the top 21 Ethereum projects with the most TVL as of April 24, 2022:\nThe Top 21 DeFi Projects by TVL\nImage courtesy of cottonbro\n21.

As regular readers know, I\u2019ve been researching and writing about eugenics myself for the last two years \u2014 you\u2019re probably sick of it by now! \u2014 so I read Rutherford\u2019s book to learn and review.\nThe book has two parts. The first is a history of \u2018eugenics\u2019, the movement begun by Francis Galton in the late 19th century, which led policy makers around the world (but especially in the US and Nazi Germany) to enact authoritarian policies to try and protect and enhance their gene pool. This movement culminated in the atrocities of the Holocaust, after which eugenics seemed to disappear.\nExcept, as Rutherford explores in the second part of the book, it didn\u2019t disappear entirely. Eugenic policies to sterilize the \u2018unfit\u2019 continued in countries around the world until the 1980s \u2014 China still has a eugenics law.\nAnd, in the last few years, left-wing critics have seen the spectre of eugenics everywhere. Student activists have been shocked to discover that various famous biologists, geneticists, psychologists and statisticians from the late 19th or early 20th century were eugenicists and / or scientific racists, and have demanded that universities repent of their historical sins and stop honouring these villains with statues or halls named after them. Among the \u2018cancelled\u2019 are Francis Galton, Thomas Huxley, Marie Stopes, Margaret Sanger, Ronald Fischer, Karl Pearson, Cyril Burt and even Darwin himself.\nAnd activists have also started seeing eugenicists under the bed in modern politics too. Most obviously, Boris Johnson\u2019s former policy supremo, Dominic Cummings, has shown a fascination with genetics and the possibility of creating genius babies through genetic enhancement, and hosted the scientist most involved in this effort \u2014 Steve Hsu \u2014 at Number 10. Hsu has been leading a similar project for the Chinese government.\nCummings, left, and Steve Hsu\nRutherford\u2019s aim thus appears to be two-fold. First, remind us of the awful history of eugenics from the 1880s to the 1940s, acknowledge the sins of past scientists, while reminding us that they were still in other respects very skilled scientists who built the foundation of modern statistics and genetics. We don\u2019t need to have statues of them or halls named after them, but we still use their science. Second, explore to what extent Rutherford\u2019s own field \u2014 modern genetics \u2014 is \u2018eugenics\u2019.\nThe first part of the book is a good conventional history of eugenics. It highlights the usual villains \u2014 proto-eugenicist Plato, intellectual elitist Francis Galton, the British Fabian socialists who took eugenics into public policy, the American racists who used the dodgy statistics of eugenics to shut down immigration to the US in the 1930s, and finally the Nazis who whole-heartedly embraced eugenics and used it to justify mass murder.\nThis effort is to be applauded. It is crucial that scientists understand their research always occurs in a political and historical context. Too many contemporary defenders of, say, the science of IQ and racial differences in IQ seem to be historically and politically tone-deaf. Rutherford is a wonderful example of a historically-conscious scientist, indeed he teaches the history of eugenics to students in University College London\u2019s genetics programme.\nHowever, the history of eugenics that he tells is, in a way, quite conventional. Rutherford concludes that eugenics was a project of upper-class white men obsessed with controlling the reproduction of women, the working class and ethnic minorities.\nThis might be music to leftist undergraduates\u2019 ears, and it is true to some extent, but it\u2019s not the whole truth. Firstly, eugenics was very much a middle-class project. Rutherford is wrong when he says Galton was upper class. Eugenics, like Darwinism, was a product of the 19th-century \u2018intellectual aristocracy\u2019 and its gospel of meritocracy \u2014 the aim was to discover natural talent through exams and then promote it. That\u2019s why the inventors of modern exams like the SAT or the IQ test were typically eugenicists.\nSecondly, the history of eugenics, as I\u2019ve explored in this blog, is weirder, more complicated and more interesting than the conventional history that Rutherford tells. As Alison Bashford \u2014 the great expert on eugenics \u2014 has explored in her books, eugenics wasn\u2019t just an attempt by men to control women. Some of its most active promoters were women, who used the discourse of eugenics to promote birth control, as a way to liberate women from the tyranny of endless motherhood. The Eugenics Society in the UK was founded by a woman and largely run by women.\nEugenics also overlapped with Malthusianism, and with cosmopolitanism and pacificism. Malthusians, as Bashford has explored, tried to take a global, ecological view of the human species and its place in the planetary ecosystem. They were the architects of global governance institutions like the United Nations. They saw global population control as essential to preventing wars, and protecting quality of life and the environment. And they also tended to be eugenicists.\nAs I explore in my \u2018spiritual eugenics\u2019 project, eugenics also overlapped with New Age spirituality and the dream of creating Nietzchean superbeings. Many pioneering New Age figures, from Annie Besant to Aldous Huxley to Abraham Maslow to Osho and Timothy Leary, embraced eugenics in some form. There were also African-American eugenicists, Indian yogic eugenicists, even queer eugenicists who saw gays or lesbians as the evolutionary future (weird but true).\nFinally, the history of \u2018eugenics\u2019 is much older than Francis Galton, older even than Plato. Galton coined a new word for a very old practice \u2014 selective breeding, which simply means humans consciously breeding themselves and other species to try and create new types that are \u2018fitter\u2019 in some chosen respect.\nSelective breeding created civilization. It gave us wheat, barley, cattle, milk, horses, dogs, most fruit and vegetables. Without selective breeding homo sapiens would not have advanced beyond hunter gatherers. We also practice selective breeding every time we weigh up a prospective mate and imagine what our children would be like.\nFrom this point of view, we are all \u2018eugenicists\u2019 \u2014 Galton massively over-claimed when he announced his new science-religion. Even in the mid-19th century, the idea that heredity played a major role in people\u2019s character, and that therefore we should breed carefully, was widely accepted. It was promoted by one of the best-selling books of the 19th century, George Coombe\u2019s The Constitution of Man in Relation to External Objects, which was published in 1828 and was far more widely read than anything Galton wrote.\nVictorians were fascinated by heredity and the possibility of creating new \u2018types\u2019 through selective breeding \u2014 this was the heyday of dog-breeding and cattle-breeding associations. So they were already primed to accept both Darwinism and Galton\u2019s \u2018eugenics\u2019.\nWhat was new in Galton\u2019s \u2018eugenics\u2019 was the suggestion the state should intervene so vigorously to encourage the \u2018fit\u2019 to the breed more and the \u2018unfit\u2019 to breed less. And Galton\u2019s work encouraged a concerted public policy movement which, tragically, was actively taken up by American racists and the Nazi party.\nNot all eugenicists were racists however. Julian Huxley, the leading British eugenicist in the 1930s-1960s, was a firm opponent of scientific racism, and ordered the UNESCO statement on race, which declared race to be a pseudo-scientific concept. Luther Burbank, the fascinating American plant-breeder, thought the US should use eugenics to encourage the inter-mingling of races to create a super-race.\nLuther Burbank, the \u2018plant wizard\u2019 who thought different human races should be encouraged to intermarry to produce an American super-race\nIn fact, in the 1920s \u2018eugenics\u2019 was used to mean everything from sex education to empowering women to be able to choose their sexual partners. So it\u2019s not surprising that everyone seemed to be a eugenicist in the 1920s.\nSo\u2026the history of eugenics is more complicated and more interesting than the conventional history. But what Rutherford says is still true and valuable to hear. Above all, he highlights that the eugenic attempt to improve the species, or a particular race, by sterilizing the \u2018unfit\u2019 was doomed to failure. We now know that traits like low intelligence, alcoholism or epilepsy (all of which could get you sterilized in some American states in the 1920s) depend not on a single heritable gene, but on multiple genes interacting in very complicated ways. The Nazis murdered millions, and did nothing to improve their gene pool. If anything, the suffering they inflicted on Germans and other people harmed the European gene pool.\nIs eugenics coming back?\nIn part two of the book, Rutherford asks whether eugenics is making a comeback today through the field of genetic enhancement. This, I suspect, is why the Left is so obsessed with eugenics now. We\u2019re arguing about the past but really fighting over the future. It\u2019s a battle between egalitarianism / social justice and genetic meritocracy. This could be one of the great ideological battles of this century. Maybe it already is.\nRutherford notes with embarrassment that his own university, University College London, was the site of a conference on genetics and IQ, which included some scientific racists. It was an external event, he says, not hosted by UCL, but the university was sufficiently embarrassed that it launched a multi-year commission into its eugenic history.\nAs for Steve Hsu and Dominic Cummings\u2019 dream of engineering species-advancing geniuses, Rutherford is sceptical that this is or ever will be possible, as IQ is too \u2018polygenic\u2019 (ie dependent on multiple interacting genes). The complexity of genetics makes it equally unlikely, he says, that we\u2019re heading into an era of designer babies, where rich parents can pick things like height, skin colour, sporting ability, strong immunity and so on.\nWe are, however, able to screen foetuses for some conditions, like Down Syndrome, and around 90% of Down Syndrome foetuses are aborted. Is that eugenics or female empowerment? For progressives in the 1920s, it was both. Rutherford doesn\u2019t try to decide what is the right choice in that circumstance, leaving it to the mother (and father).\nI am not qualified to question Rutherford\u2019s conclusion that the dream of designer babies is just that, a dream. Certainly, a lot of money is going into gene editing companies, and into companies that try to identify \u2018super-genes\u2019. Perhaps designer babies are impossible at the moment\u2026but the science seems to be moving fast.\nThere are two new frontiers of eugenics / selective breeding. One is dating apps. Dating apps are how we select our partners these days, so they are having a massive impact on our reproductive choices and evolutionary future. As I wrote in 2018, online dating has led to a steep rise in the proportion of inter-racial couples \u2014 which would horrify racist eugenicists but elate a champion of inter-racial breeding like Luther Burbank. Harvard geneticist George Church has launched an app that lets people match through genetic fitness. Countries like China and Iran, meanwhile, have introduced state-owned dating apps to encourage their citizens to breed and to nudge the right sort of citizen (ie Han Chinse or Muslim) to breed more.\nThe other new frontier for eugenics / selective breeding is synthetic biology. Luther Burbank could create new forms of fruit or vegetable by careful cross-breeding over ten generations (he created the stoneless plum and the golden delicious apple for example). But now, computer technology makes it possible for undergraduates to create entirely novel types simply by computer editing \u2014 glow-in-the-dark rabbits, for example, or, more worryingly, hyper-infectious viruses.\nAnother ideological battle of the near-future will be how we relate to this sort of synthetic biology and genetic editing. The pandemic has highlighted how controversial new technology like mRNA vaccines can be \u2014 and also raised fears that COVID19 was itself a product of synthetic biology.\nPersonally, the last two years have made me more open to new technology, not less. As our climate rapidly changes, I think we will need all our ingenuity to create new forms of fuel, food and medicine, and synthetic biology gives us the building blocks to do that. New types of human, even? We are constantly creating new types. You\u2019re one, so am I, so are our children. \u2018Nature\u2019 is a programme that we are endlessly editing.\nHowever, as Rutherford shows, the dream of perfecting humans is extremely hazardous \u2014 as soon as we dream of creating \u2018superhumans\u2019 we seem to become incredibly intolerant of those we deem less than perfect. And we are all less than perfect. As Thomas Huxley noted, those who speak glibly of exterminating the imperfect seem to forget that we all have days when we could qualify as \u2018unfit\u2019.\n", "comment_count": 4, "like_count": 113, "created_time": 1643985922659, "comment": [{"user_id": "5b52999d576", "comment_time": 1643985922659, "comment": "Thank you for sharing!"}, {"user_id": "1b443347d2e9", "comment_time": 1644083465477, "comment": "Boy is that a glowing green can of worms.

In the days after, I was researching Jake Angeli, the \u2018Qanon shaman\u2019, and discovered he ran something called the \u2018Starseed Academy. Like other \u2018starseeds\u2019, Jake thinks he is a highly evolved soul from another planet. I wondered what a psychedelic hippy alien was doing mixed up in a quasi-fascist insurrection.\nSince then, I\u2019ve dived deeper into the phenomenon of starseeds, and realized the idea of \u2018starseeds\u2019 has deep historical links with fascism and white supremacy. In fact, one of the pioneers of the idea was imprisoned 60 years before Angeli, for plotting a fascist uprising in the US. I won\u2019t argue all contemporary starseeds are fascists, of course, simply that the idea\u2019s historical origins are to some extent in white supremacist movements.\nThis weird history has four parts:\n1) The origins of UFO mythology in the occulture of 1880s-1930s\n2) White supremacy and anti-semitism in UFO culture in the 1950s-1990s\n3) The idea of Starseeds from the 1970s to the present day\n4) Finally, I\u2019ll ask \u2018why is the idea of being a Starseed so appealing to young people now?\u2019\n1) The origins of UFO mythology in the occulture of 1880s-1930s\nAt the end of the 19th century, the public imagination was filled with the idea of voyages to space and encounters with extra-terrestrial civilizations. Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli had observed what looked like water channels on Mars, leading to excited speculations the planet was filled with artificial canals. In 1902, George M\u00e9li\u00e8s made the first science fiction movie, A Trip to the Moon.\nThese fantasies found their way into the occulture. In 1900, French psychologist Theodore Flournoy published From India to the Planet Mars, an account of his hypnotism sessions with a medium, Helene Smith. In trance states, Helene recounted past lives on Earth, and also on Mars and Uranus.\nAt the same time, members of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, a fin-de-siecle occult society whose members included WB Yeats and Aleister Crowley, practiced \u2018astral travel\u2019 to other planets. These were extended visualization exercises in which the magicians sent their spirits out into space, where they sometimes encountered planetary and astral spirits. This is Aleister Crowley\u2019s drawing of one such interstellar spirit.\n\nAs previously discussed, the Golden Dawn saw themselves as an elite organization dedicated to helping humanity evolve into superhumans. Part of this involved \u2018occult eugenics\u2019 \u2014 the Golden Dawn thought you could draw down powers from the stars and the spirit world during procreation and pregnancy, thereby creating what Aleister Crowley called a \u2018moon child\u2019.\nHG Wells, meanwhile, was imagining trips to space and alien invasions in his early science-fiction novels. In War of the Worlds (1898) he imagines blood-sucking octopi invading the Earth from Mars. But in most of his sci-fi works, he imagines humans encountering superhumans either from the future or from some parallel universe. These \u2018Utopians\u2019 \u2014 taller, smarter and more beautiful than humans \u2014 warn that humanity is heading for catastrophe, due to over-population, nuclear war and ecological collapse. We need to evolve to a higher level, through global government, population control, ecological planning and eugenics. Some humans are ascending into superhumans, but most are not.\nIn one of his last novels, Star-Begotten (1937), a scientist starts to believe that an alien civilization is beaming rays onto Earth, to alter the genetics of humanity. Some humans (including the hero) are \u2018star-begotten\u2019 \u2014 a superior species spawned by these extra-terrestrial rays, who will save the planet from catastrophe. This explains why a few people are so much smarter and more visionary than the masses. The hero exclaims:\nI hate common humanity. This oafish crowd which tramples the ground whence my cloud-capped pinnacles might rise. I am tired of humanity \u2014 beyond measure. Take it away\u2026Clear the earth of them!\n\nBut the most important occult influence for UFO culture is Theosophy. This was a new religious movement that appeared in the 1870s, invented by a Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 called Madame Helena Blavatsky. Theosophy emerged as a reaction to the triumph of Darwinism and scientific materialism in the 1860s and 1870s. Blavatsky offered her followers a synthesis of science and occult wisdom, which included her own spiritual version of evolution. She claimed that evolution was a progressive spiritual process, guided by a handful of superhuman beings called \u2018The Masters\u2019, some of whom lived on Earth, and some on other planets.\nHumanity, she claimed, had evolved for millions of years through various \u2018root-races\u2019, including the Lemurians, the Atlanteans (from Atlantis), and the present dominant race, the Aryans. A new root-race is now emerging, allegedly, in California. There\u2019s an element of spiritual racism to this theory. Some races are spiritually lower and more primitive than others, indeed, \u2018the sacred spark is missing in them\u2019. Other races are higher, such as the Aryans (although Blavatsky was quite scornful of Anglo-Saxons and her Masters tended to be Indian). Like Darwin, Blavatsky thought \u2018lower\u2019 races were destined to die out and be succeeded by \u2018higher\u2019 races.\nTheosophy was taken up by various movements around the world, who imagined different versions of the coming super-race. In Germany, Theosophists insisted the super-race were Aryans. German Theosophy developed in the Volkisch occulture of the 19th century, which celebrated the superiority of the German soul, German kultur, the German volk, German paganism, and so on. Figures like Houston Chamberlain (a British writer who emigrated to Germany) wrote long treatises on the physical, cultural and spiritual superiority of the Teutonic / Nordic / Aryan race.\nOne finds this Aryan or white supremacy in German theosophy. Rudolf Steiner, leader of Anthroposophy, claimed that all cultural achievements came from the white race, who are more spiritual and \u2018cosmic\u2019 than other races. J\u00f6rg Lanz von Liebenfels, inventor of Ariosophy, claimed that \u2018the Aryan hero is on this planet the most complete incarnation of God and of the Spirit\u2019. In fact, Aryans have a different origin from other species:\nThe race of full-blooded and whole Aryan Man was not the result of natural selection alone. Instead, as the esoteric writings indicate, he was the result of a careful and conscious breeding process by higher and different kinds of being, such as the Theozoa, Elektrozoa, Angels, et sim., which once lived on this Earth.\nSteiner and Lanz both thought the Aryan race needed to be kept pure, through measures such as segregation, miscegenation laws, and eugenics. Lanz advocated the mass castration of other races to protect the purity of Aryan women.\nThis sort of spiritual racism had a profound influence on the Nazis. Hitler and his followers believed the Aryan race was spiritually superior to all other races, and he saw his spiritual mission as the purifying and perfecting of the blonde, blue-eyed Aryan race, and the subjugation or elimination of all inferior races, especially the snake-like Jews.\nThis dream survived beyond World War II.\n2) White supremacy and anti-Semitism in UFO culture in the 1950s-1990s\nIn the 1950s, the Soviet space programme was launched, and reports of UFO sightings filled the press. In the early 1950s, people started to claim they\u2019d had contact with extraterrestrials. A Californian called George Adamski reported that on the 20th November 1952, he and some friends had seen a UFO above the Colorado desert, and then he\u2019d met a tall humanoid man, who had communicated with him through hand gestures, telepathy, and occult symbols on his footprints.\nAdamski wrote an account of his encounter which was published in the 1953 best-seller, Flying Saucers Have Landed. It was co-written with a British author, Desmond Leslie, who suggested religions and myths of the past actually referred to UFOs and alien visitations. Their book launched two incredibly popular genres \u2014 alien contact stories and the \u2018ancient alien hypothesis\u2019 (i.e religions are evidence of alien visits in the past) .\nIn the sequel, Inside the Space Ships (1955), Adamski meets the alien again. This time, the alien speaks perfect English, and introduces himself as Orthon. He takes him into his spaceship, where Adamski meets \u2018The Master\u2019, who warns him that humanity is heading for disaster because of over-population and nuclear war. The Master calls humanity to a more spiritual existence.\nThis episode clearly owes something to the sci-fi movie, The Day the Earth Stood Still, which came out in 1951 and also featured a tall, benevolent alien who urges humanity to mend its ways. But (as several academics have noted - see bibliography at end) it also owes a lot to Theosophy.\nAdamski and his fellow contactees were part of the Californian Theosophical occulture. Adamski founded a short-lived occult organization called the Royal Order of Tibet, while his friend George Williamson (who also supposedly witnessed the UFO) worked for a Theosophical organization called Soulcraft. They shifted Theosophy into space, and turned Blavatsky\u2019s Masters from Indians into extra-terrestrials. Indeed, Adamski\u2019s co-author, Desmond Leslie, wrote to him:\nI don\u2019t know what has happened, George, but all the mediums have suddenly disposed of their Indian guides, etc, and have replaced them with space people.\n[Quoted in Flying Saucers Farewell, p61]\nOne also finds the racism of Theosophy in UFO culture. Many of the aliens encountered in the 1950s, and ever since, are remarkably Aryan. Orthon, for example, is described as tall, Occidental-looking and \u2018sandy-haired\u2019. Many later alien encounters also involved blond aliens, who have since been popularized as \u2018Nordic aliens\u2019 \u2014 white supremacists often celebrated the superiority of the \u2018Nordic race\u2019.\n\nIn addition, one of the occult symbols on Orthon\u2019s shoe was a swastika:\n\nThis may not be an accident. George Hunt Williamson, who was with Adamski during the first alleged encounter, worked at a Californian occult organization called Soulcraft, run by an American fascist called William Dudley Pelley, nicknamed \u2018America\u2019s Hitler\u2019.\nPelley worked as a struggling screenwriter and Theosophist in Los Angeles in the 1920s. He claimed to have had an near-death experience in 1928, described in his 1929 book My Seven Minutes in Eternity, in which a spirit appeared and explained that human races exist in a spiritual hierarchy, with black people at the bottom and white people at the apex.\nPelley subsequently launched a Theosophical movement, which didn\u2019t attract many followers. But it did inspire various more successful offshoots, including the I AM movement, which was started by Guy Ballard in the 1930s. Ballard claimed to have encountered Aryan extraterrestrials on Mount Shasta in California.\nThe Great Divine Director from Guy Ballard\u2019s I AM movement\nPelley\u2019s own movement, meanwhile, veered into fascist politics. In the 1930s, Pelley claimed to be the first American to declare his support for Adolf Hitler and Nazism. He launched his own fascist organization, the Silver League, railed against global Jewry, and called for the overthrow of American secular democracy. This got him imprisoned for sedition in 1942. He was released in 1950, and that same year he published Star Guests. This is the first book to claim that aliens have been interbreeding with humans.\n\nPelley suggests that humans were created by \u2018star guests\u2019 from the star Sirius, who inter-bred with apes from Earth. Pelley called this alien intervention \u2018celestial eugenics\u2019. But the project didn\u2019t go as planned \u2014 the aliens and their hybrid offspring bred with animals too indiscriminately.\nThe result was a confusion that almost defeated the original plans of creation. Beast forms and celestial forms were fused together in an insufferable bastard creation from which certain specimens of the two creations are evincing even down here in the twentieth century\nAs a result of this \u2018Great Abomination\u2019, there are various different races now on Earth \u2014 the Sons of God from Sirius, the \u2018Goodly Company\u2019 of 144,000 pure souls, and various bastard \u2018ape-men\u2019. There are also \u2018foreign spirits\u2019, who are a meddling, lying \u2018alien menace\u2019 (ie Jews). The Age of Aquarius is coming, Pelley says, but first we need some \u2018spiritual eugenics\u2019 to \u2018cleanse\u2019 humanity of the bastard hybrids and foreign spirits. This ethnic cleansing will be led by the divine ruler of Sirius:\nOne by one do we eliminate great social cancers\u2026One by one do we eliminate the princes of evil from their petty thrones, setting up potentates under us who are of the Goodly Company. Now mark this, beloved \u2014 I AM COMING BACK TO THE EARTH-PLANE IN PERSON!\n[Star Guests, p.204]\nAs mentioned, one of Pelley\u2019s followers was George Hunt Williamson, who was supposedly present when George Adamski first encountered Orthon, the Nordic alien. In 1953, Williamson published his own UFO book, called Other Tongues, Other Flesh. It tells a similar story \u2014 aliens have been visiting Earth for millennia to interbreed and aid our evolution. However they have interbred indiscriminately and now \u2018harversters\u2019 need to come, to separate the \u2018brute from the angel\u2019. Williamson introduces a new twist. Earth is also inhabited by an evil, reptile-like species from the constellation Orion.\nThese \u2018serpent-people\u2019, or \u2018Anti-Christs\u2019, are \u2018small in stature with strange, oriental type eyes. Their faces are thin and they possess weak bodies. They come among us to disperse all things not in keeping with their own ideas\u2019. They are \u2018talkative\u2026materialistic\u2026not of pure aspiration toward the Father\u2026they are the Universal parasites! Disturbers, negative elements, soon they will be eradicated\u2026\u2019\n[Other Tongues, Other Flesh, p.176]\nHe adds:\nTheir sun is about to set, and their day is done. Their power is momentary now as the Earth prepares for its Graduation Day, its Purification Day\n[p226]\nThe idea of reptile-people from Orion would last up to the present day. Needless to say, Williamson\u2019s description is remarkably similar to the anti-Semitic tropes found in fascist literature, where Jews are also described as serpents, liars, parasites, materialistic and so on. To clarify matters, five years later in UFO Confidential, Williamson wrote that all governments \u2018are under the complete control of the \u2018International Bankers\u2019. He agreed with Pelley that global Jewry are trying to over throw nation states through the United Nations.\n\n\nNazi and far-right anti-semitic cartoons often portrayed Jews as snakes and lizards\nLater alien contactees have continued in this anti-Semitic vein. Retired nurse Doris Ekker of Tehachapi, California, claimed in the 1990s to receive messages from a nine-foot extraterrestrial from the Pleiades called Hatonn the Commander. Most involved long screeds against Jews \u2014 Hatonn twice repeated the entire text of the infamous forged conspiracy theory, The Protocols of the Elders of Zion.\nAlso during the 1990s, British Theosophical conspiracy theorist David Icke claimed the human race is under attack by an alien reptile race of Lemurians, who have perpetuated their race by breeding with particular families, including the Rothschilds. Icke also imports much of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion into his fantasies \u2014 he published the book as an appendix to one of his works, adding it was all accurate if you merely changed the word \u2018Jews\u2019 for \u2018Lizards\u2019.\nA meme connecting the \u2018reptile lizard\u2019 fantasy to older anti-semitic tropes\nEven when aliens aren\u2019t reciting the Protocols, one often finds in UFO culture hopes or fears around eugenics, genetics, racial interbreeding and the evolution of super-races. Many contactees or abductees are sure aliens are genetically modifying humanity \u2014 where they disagree is whether this is for our benefit or to enslave us.\n3) The idea of Starseeds from the 1970s to the present day\nThis brings us to the contemporary phenomenon of \u2018starseeds\u2019 \u2014 people who think they\u2019re actually aliens themselves. We\u2019ve seen some progenitors for this idea \u2014 Crowley\u2019s \u2018moonchildren\u2019, HG Wells\u2019 \u2018star-begotten\u2019, Pelley\u2019s \u2018star guests\u2019. But the first to use the phrase \u2018starseed\u2019 was actually Timothy Leary.\nIn the early 1970s, Leary was kicking his heels in Fulsome Prison, having been arrested for drug trafficking. He claimed he started to receive messages from the star Sirius, calling humanity to evolve into inter-stellar superbeings (it\u2019s not clear how serious / Sirius he was being). He and another inmate, who also claimed he received Sirian messages, shared these communications in their 1974 book, Terra II: A Way Out.\nThe aliens allegedly urged Leary to gather together 5000 of the smartest, healthiest and sexiest humans onto a space ship to leave Earth and \u2018seed\u2019 another planet and raise a new species of ultra-intelligent, long-living superhumans. The book declares:\nThe general rule must be that we select the strongest, most viable, superior stock from each species of life and from each human group\nYet in the illustrations, the crew are all strapping blonds:\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1977, this idea of a space exodus inspired a hoax documentary on Anglia TV called Alternatives 3, which claimed to uncover a plot to send a talented few to another planet. A similar space-eugenic fantasy is found in Moonraker, also released in 1977. The same year, Stewart Brand published an issue of Co-Evolution Quarterly dedicated to \u2018space colonies\u2019, in which the white supremacist ecologist Garrett Hardin suggested any colony would only function if it was monocultural and monoracial.\n\nMeanwhile the idea that some of us are \u2018starseeds\u2019, whose souls originate on another planet, was popularized by an American pop occult author called Brad Steiger. After writing books about werewolves, vampires and so on, Steiger struck a rich vein with Gods of Aquarius (1976) and Star People (1981), both of which claimed some humans, particularly those drawn to New Age literature, are actually \u2018starseeds\u2019 from another planet. Steiger claimed he could identify starseeds with a questionnaire, which asked readers questions like: Did you always feel your parents weren\u2019t your real parents and you have ancient ancestors? Are you unusually sensitive to light and emotions? Do you suffer from sinusitis?\nAccording to your responses, you could be a \u2018starseed\u2019, a \u2018star maiden\u2019 (like Steiger\u2019s wife, Shelley) or a slightly less exalted \u2018star helper\u2019. Needless to say, this proved immensely popular in New Age and UFO literature of the 1980s, and soon many spiritual influencers were declaring themselves \u2018starseeds\u2019. The phenomenon spread through the craze for past-life hypnotic regression \u2014 never mind remembering you were Cleopatra or Joan of Arc, now you could recall life on other planets!\n\n\n\nToday you don\u2019t have to stop merely at claiming to be a \u2018starseed\u2019. There is an endless array of different alien races and species you might have been in a past life: Pleiadean, Lyran, Sirian, Casseoipean, Acturian, Lemurian, \u2018grey\u2019, Orion, reptilian or hybrid. In the New Age version of 23andMe, New Age hustlers are happy to take your money in order to trace your ancient cosmic heritage (hint: you\u2019re almost certainly not from Earth and you were probably very high up in the Galactic Federation). Galactic \u2018genealogy\u2019 guides like the one below describe your space racial origins and characteristics:\n\nAccompanying this ever-expanding menagerie of alien races is an intricate and constantly evolving mythology of the cosmic past and present, a space opera of wars, catastrophes, and genetic engineering projects. And there is usually a future eschatology \u2014 Earth is now awakening, a judgement day is coming. As Ken Carey channels it in The Starseed Transmissions:\nThere are but two roads before you. You can walk in the innocence of those who trust in the Lord, or perish in the impending collapse of your rational systems.\nThere is obviously a strong Christian apocalyptic aspect to UFO culture. One finds this in the very popular works of Dolores Cannon, a past-life regression hypnotist, who claimed that her clients suddenly started remembering past lives on other planets, all of which conveniently agreed on a common narrative \u2014 Earth was seeded by aliens, and humans now face a crisis. Some will ascend to a higher 5-dimensional level, while others will fail to evolve. The Earth itself will split in two \u2014 a \u2018new earth\u2019 where everything is wonderful, and the old earth, where everything is terrible. Cannon believed this split would happen in 2012, but the failure of that prediction has not put off her many followers on TikTok, who are excitedly preparing for 5D ascension to the New Earth. Also reminiscent of Christianity is the \u2018light language\u2019 some starseeds speak \u2014 a cosmic version of speaking in tongues.\n\nBut if UFO culture is quite evangelical and apocalyptic, it also riffs on eugenics, genetics, and the idea of personal consumer eugenics. Starseeds preach \u2018DNA activation\u2019 \u2014 the idea that we can upgrade our DNA and activate the supposed \u2018junk\u2019 strands of it to fulfil our human or cosmic potential.\n\n4) Why is the idea of \u2018starseeds\u2019 so popular now?\nStarseeds are all the rage right now, particularly with Gen Z on tiktok, where starseed videos have a billion views. One viral video from 2021 featured a Heather-like starseed declaring \u2018everyone asks me how I know I\u2019m a starseed, but no one asks what is it like to be a starseed\u2019. There are a lot of recent books on starseeds \u2014 Letters to a Starseed, The Starseed Template, Time To Wake Up Starseeds, Activation from 7 Star Races, and so on. There are starseed shows on Gaia, and endless online quizzes where you can discover what alien race you are (I\u2019ll share one at the end). Even Cheryl has declared herself a fan of Dolores Cannon.\nSo what explains the popularity of starseeds today?\nPerhaps Gen Z and millennials feel like they\u2019ve been born into such a heavy geo-political situation, the best solution is extreme dissociation: find a happy place in another galaxy, far, far away. Perhaps the Qanon shaman, Jake Angeli, is an example of this dissociative flight to cosmic safety \u2014 he says he first realized he was a starseed when father made him smoke drugs when he was a boy.\nThe starseed myth provides what all good religions provide \u2014 an explanatory framework for suffering and evil. You\u2019re suffering because you\u2019re not from this planet. That\u2019s why you feel lonely and strangely superior to the people around you. Never mind \u2018your problems come from your parents or ancestors\u2019 \u2014 your problems come from your multiple galactic lives. Why are you phobic of dogs? Because you\u2019re a Lyran! Why do you have a speech impediment and can\u2019t pronounce your r\u2019s? Because your previous alien species didn\u2019t use r\u2019s (literally, that\u2019s what this person says).\nIn this sense, the \u2018starseed\u2019 narrative perhaps helps people bear the suffering of life. Of course you feel out of place and lonely on this heavy planet. But this is not your actual home. You chose to come here to complete a heroic mission in service of humanity. Don\u2019t be got down, you are an infinitely powerful cosmic being, probably high up in the Galactic Federation.\nThis is not so different from other religious narratives, like Platonism or Sufism, which also tell us we don\u2019t really belong on Earth, we\u2019re cosmic beings, and that\u2019s why we feel homesick. What\u2019s different about the starseed gospel is, this isn\u2019t necessarily true for all humans. You\u2019re special, you\u2019re a starseed, you\u2019re not like everyone else!\nThis is closer to the ancient religious movement known as Gnosticism, which flourished in the Mediterranean from around the first century AD. Some Gnostics believed they were a different, superior species to the rest of humanity, and they needed to escape the prison of Earth and ascend back home. Gnosticism fostered the same sort of spiritual superiority one finds sometimes in starseeds.\nThis sense of being spiritually special is potentially unhealthy, in my opinion. It splits you off from other humans. The new earth ascension myth also encourages a psychological splitting \u2014 don\u2019t ever think negative thoughts, don\u2019t read the mainstream news, and for God\u2019s sake don\u2019t get vaccinated. Only cultivate positive vibes and then you will ascend into the 5D New Earth with all the other super-spiritual starseeds.\nMore positively, you could say that UFO / starseed spirituality shows the riotous creativity of the New Age, with its expanding universe of myths and characters. Imagine if the Bible was sci-fi fan-fiction. The proliferation of alien races is a reflection of modern identity politics and of the metaverse, where you can be whatever species you want.\nAnd yet I admit I find starseed culture dispiriting. The glib certainty with which influencers inform their followers about all these made-up races and space dramas seems to me shameless profiteering. And I find it slightly terrifying how ungrounded the culture is in any sort of evidence or reasoning beyond your feelings and your imagination. Your identity depends on your feelings. Your race depends on your feelings. Reality depends on feelings.\nThat sort of free-floating reality easily swings from ecstasy to paranoia and terror. When the 5D awakening doesn\u2019t happen, the starseeds look around and ask why. It must be because of Them: the Lemurians, the Democrats, the Paedos, the Jews. 12 million Americans believe in \u2018the lizard people\u2019. That\u2019s why you see a starseed storming the Capitol, why a man in Nashville detonated a bomb to kill \u2018the lizard people\u2019 , why so many starseeds could apparently be found at Qanon rallies during the pandemic, and why starseed and ancient alien mythology features so prominently in the Qanon \u2018map of great awakening\u2019.\n\nUFO culture has always had elements that are conspiracist, White supremacist and quasi-fascist, and it\u2019s always attracted grifters and charlatans happy to make stuff up in order to make their audience feel special. It has always recycled simplistic rapture-myths where people like you are saved and the demons get exorcised. One can\u2019t help noticing that, even though you can now choose to be an infinite number of alien species, the most popular still seems to be the highly Aryan Pleiadians.\n\n\n\nFinally, I guess you want to know what alien species you are, right?\nNo problem, just take this quick quiz.\nA) Do you have blue eyes?\nB) Do you sometimes feel homesick?\nC) Do you ever long for a Great Purification to sweep away the dross of humanity?\nJust click here to find out your results!\n*****\nBibliography:\nAnthropologist Susanna Crockford has a great chapter on starseeds in her new book on Sedona spirituality, Ripples of the Universe\nWilliam Dudley Pelley: A Life in Right-Wing Extremism and the Occult, by Scott Beekman\nUFO Religions, edited by Christopher Partridge\nET Culture: Anthropology in Outer Spaces, edited by Debbora Battaglia, especially the chapter on race by Christopher Roth\nMahatmas in Space, by Mikhail Rothstein\nHandbook of Spiritualism and Channelling, edited by Cathy Gutierrez, especially Christopher Partridge\u2019s chapter on channelling extra-terrestrials\n\u201cThese Are They\u201d: ET-Human Hybridization and the New Daemonology, by Robert Pearson Flaherty\n\u2018Race and (the Study of) Esotericism\u2019 by Justine Bakker\nThis is a great recent article on starseeds by \u2018Default Friend\u2019", "comment_count": 4, "like_count": 299, "created_time": 1651249068473, "comment": [{"user_id": "5b52999d576", "comment_time": 1651249068473, "comment": "Thank you for sharing!"}, {"user_id": "f6050efaa290", "comment_time": 1651271118733, "comment": "Heya Jules! big reader of your writing, but in this one you\u2019re missing an important root, and it\u2019s not going to give you results consistent with other things in this article. \n\nThe \u201cstarseed transmissions\u201d were, specifically, Timothy Leary\u2019s and Robert Anton Wilson\u2019s \u201cfuture sci-fi psy-phy\u201d, specifically the \u201cSMILE\u201d of Leary\u2019s neurologic.

Evidence suggests that more and more people in western culture are having and seeking ecstatic experiences, because of the growing popularity of psychedelics and contemplative practices like meditation and yoga. However, we have scant cultural resources for making sense of such experiences.\n\nOrdinary people who have ecstatic experiences have very few places to go for information about them. This means they will turn to secular psychiatrists, who may pathologize their experience, or to religious or spiritual influencers, who often have self-serving or conspiritualist agendas. Ecstatic experiences can be healthy and healing, but they can also be dangerous both for individuals and their societies. We urgently need a more mature cultural understanding of ecstatic experiences, to support individuals and the health of the body politic.\nHere are ten principles to help people make sense of ecstatic experiences (with thanks to BuddhaMemeFolder and Healing from Healing for the memes).\n1) Ecstatic experiences are common and normal\nAn ecstatic experience is a moment where the mind goes into an altered state of consciousness and one\u2019s ordinary sense of self and reality changes. Historically, such experiences tended to involve a feeling of ego-dissolution (ecstasis literally means \u2018standing outside\u2019 your usual self) and a feeling of \u2018enthusiasm\u2019 \u2014 a god or spirit enters you. The anthropologist Erika Bourguignon found that 90% of human societies had institutionalized rituals for the attainment of altered states of consciousness. Humans seek ecstatic experiences for meaning, healing, religious worship, creativity, social connection, and fun.\nMost cultures have seen ecstatic experiences as potentially dangerous and disruptive, hence they devised rules and rituals to manage them for the good of individuals and society. Modern western culture, unusually, sought to marginalize and pathologize ecstatic experiences entirely. They were associated with delusion, madness and psychosis. And it\u2019s true that ecstatic experiences can be akin to temporary psychosis. However, other cultures have suggested this temporary madness can have benefits for an individual and their society, if properly managed.\nGoya\u2019s The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters. Modern western culture sought to marginalize and pathologize ecstatic experiences, which most other cultures recognized as both potentially harmful and also potentially valuable\n2) Ecstatic experiences are neither good nor bad in themselves\nThey are amoral. They have no essential moral content. They involve a range of psychological states which can be put to all kinds of different moral and ideological ends. This point was well made by the philosopher Slavoj Zizek, who explored how Beethoven\u2019s ecstatic Ode to Joy was used by a whole variety of political ideologies, from the EU to Nazi Germany.\n3) Having an ecstatic experience doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you\u2019re special, holy or spiritually advanced\nEcstatic experiences are normal and common. Some people have them every day. Some personality types are more prone to them. Having an ecstatic experience or many ecstatic experiences does not mean you\u2019re special, holy or spiritually advanced, and not having such experiences doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re missing out.\nIt can feel like you\u2019re special after having an ecstatic experience \u2014 that\u2019s one of their allures. In some cultures certain types of mental state are taken as proof of your spiritual advancement. However, one of the risks of ecstatic experience is ego inflation \u2014 thinking you\u2019re uniquely blessed, divinely chosen, elect, highly evolved, or even the Messiah. This risk is particularly acute in a culture like New Age spirituality, where spiritual literacy (ie a passing familiarity with terms like samedhi or jhana) far outstrips spiritual maturity.\n\n4) Having an ecstatic experience in someone else\u2019s presence doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they\u2019re holy or spiritually advanced\nOne of the biggest triggers for ecstatic experience is the expectation of having an ecstatic experience. That\u2019s why people who go to see a spiritual teacher with the expectation of an ecstatic encounter may indeed have an ecstatic encounter, which they then take as proof of the holiness or even supernatural power of that teacher. In addition, teachers may develop techniques to enhance their own charisma and the suggestibility of their followers, such as eye-staring, sleep deprivation, hypnotic techniques, the use of psychedelics, and so on. History is full of examples of gurus whose followers thought they were highly spiritually advanced, and who often experienced ecstatic experiences in their presence, yet they turned out to be abusers, swindlers, criminals and psychopaths. Having an ecstatic experience in someone\u2019s presence is not reliable evidence of their sanctity.\n\n5) Ecstatic experiences aren\u2019t necessarily supernatural\nIt\u2019s impossible for the sciences or humanities to say, let alone measure, to what extent an ecstatic experience really is from God, the spirit world or some sort of higher intelligence. Suffice it to say that most mature religious traditions suggest that not all ecstatic experiences are necessarily from God or the spirit world. Christian theologians like Jonathan Edwards, who wrote during the 18th century ecstatic movement known as the Great Awakening, came to the conclusion that some ecstatic experiences are the result of psychology \u2014 social contagion, for example, or an over-excited imagination. There are a variety of different possible explanatory frameworks for ecstatic experience, some supernatural and some naturalist. Some naturalist frameworks still recognize potential benefits to ecstatic experiences, without thinking they involve God or the spirit world.\n6) Your ecstatic insights aren\u2019t necessarily correct or valuable\nThey can feel totally true and revelatory. Indeed, that\u2019s one of the characteristics of ecstatic experience, as William James pointed out. And sometimes, the truths or insights revealed in ecstatic experiences have stood the test of time, and proven of sustained value for the arts, sciences or culture. However, there are also countless examples of ecstatic experiences which proved to be unreliable or simply nonsense. Oliver Wendell Holmes Senior once experimented with ether to try and discover ultimate truths. He wrote:\nThe veil of eternity was lifted. The one great truth which underlies all human experience, and is the key to all the mysteries that philosophy has sought in vain to solve, flashed upon me in a sudden revelation. Henceforth all was clear: a few words had lifted my intelligence to the level of the knowledge of the cherubim. As my natural condition returned, I remembered my resolution; and, staggering to my desk, I wrote, in ill-shaped, straggling characters, the all-embracing truth still glimmering in my consciousness. The words were these (children may smile; the wise will ponder): \u2018A strong smell of turpentine prevails throughout.\u2019\n\n7) Ecstatic experiences are ambiguous\nEcstatic experiences are ambiguous. They can both feel like a flood of meaning, and leave people trying to make sense of them for years. They can feel both enlightening and bewildering. They can move from euphoric to terrifying in minutes. They are dynamic, paradoxical, \u2018both-and\u2019 rather than \u2018either-or\u2019, and not easily captured in logical propositions or quantitative questionnaires.\nWestern culture in the last 300 years has tended to take a rather immature, black-and-white view of ecstatic experiences, seeing them either as wholly delusional or wholly holy. One still finds this immature attitude in charismatic Christian churches, where holy spirit encounters are seen as totally good and their meaning is seen as totally transparent. Such experiences are rapidly converted into dogmatic testimonials for the church where they occurred. Something similar occurs in the emerging science-religion of psychedelics \u2014 people\u2019s experiences are seized on and rapidly converted into dogmatic testimonials for the movement. All ambiguity is collapsed into soundbite headlines like \u2018I\u2019ve never felt such joy\u2019 or \u2018the most meaningful experience ever\u2019. Psychedelic science even uses a \u2018mystical questionnaire\u2019 to give ecstatic experiences a score out of ten according to how \u2018complete\u2019 it is.\nA mature culture, by contrast, respects the ambiguity of ecstatic experiences and recognizes that something in these experiences defies easy interpretation, classification or analysis. Even in religious cultures which see ecstatic experiences as potentially revelatory, it is still understood that they are ambiguous, and one should be careful before interpreting them too quickly or literally. As the religious studies scholar Jeffrey Kripal has suggested, ecstatic experiences can be seen as texts, with multiple levels of meaning and symbolism. A mature culture recognizes these multiple possible levels and is wary of collapsing ambiguity into one simplistic interpretation.\n8) Ecstatic experiences aren\u2019t always healing\n\nThe emerging science-religion of psychedelics, like Christianity, has made very strong claims about the saving power of the psychedelic experience, leading countless people to look to these experiences to rescue them from their mental, emotional and existential problems. And for some people, ecstatic experiences (whether via psychedelics or other avenues) can be genuinely healing and life-changing. But it\u2019s not always the case. Ecstatic experiences sometimes don\u2019t totally \u2018heal\u2019 a person from, say, PTSD or depression. Or they may only give temporary release from habitual ego patterns, which then subsequently re-assert themselves.\nMost religious traditions suggest that occasional ecstatic experiences need to be followed up by daily practice of some kind, to turn altered states into altered traits of personality. Even then, it might not \u2018work\u2019 in the sense of healing you of all your problems.\nOccasionally, ecstatic experiences can cause or exacerbate mental health problems, triggering temporary or long-term psychosis, for example, or leaving a person feeling more confused and disconnected from consensus reality than before the experience. Some of these more difficult ecstatic experiences (sometimes called \u2018spiritual emergencies\u2019 or \u2018dark nights of the soul\u2019) can be resolved with therapy or other methods. But not always.\n9) There are many routes to ecstatic experience, and your preferred route is not necessarily the best or only one\nEcstatic experiences can open one\u2019s mind and increase epistemic flexibility, but they can also close one\u2019s mind and lead to dogmatic exclusivism \u2014 your route to ecstatic experience is the best route and even the only route. Accept no substitutes. This dogmatic exclusivism is often exacerbated, of course, by religions and churches, who seek to establish monopolies on ecstasy, like the Christian emperor Theodosius, who closed down all non-Christian cults throughout his empire. Even today, one sees a form of psychedelic exclusivism in some psychonauts \u2014 only psychedelics grant a true revelation of the divine, and perhaps only their preferred drug grants a true revelation. Everyone else\u2019s non-pharmacological route to ecstatic experience is a poor and phony substitute. No. There are infinite routes to ecstatic experience. Some routes may be easier or more reliable than others, but that doesn\u2019t make them necessarily better or more truth-revealing.\n10) The meaning of life is not necessarily to have as many or as powerful ecstatic experiences as possible\nBoth in Christian and New Age cultures, one can see a tendency to fetishize ecstatic experiences, to see them as the ultimate meaning and goal of life, and to try and consume as many of them as possible. This is also a heritage of the Romantic movement, which placed a huge value on occasional ecstatic experiences.\nThis excessive emphasis on ecstatic experiences can be unhealthy, and lead to a denigration of ordinary life. There is such a thing as addiction to ecstatic experiences, and spiritual bypassing of unpleasant facts. Ecstasy-chasing can also be profoundly selfish. A mature culture sees ecstatic experiences as normal and human moments, which may occasionally be intentionally sought for purposes of healing, meaning, connection or fun. But they\u2019re transient, ambiguous experiences and certainly not the entire meaning or goal of life. An immature culture is obsessed with such experiences and places too high a value upon them.\n\nFinally, here is an incomplete list of books I\u2019ve found useful on this topic:\nWilliam James, The Varieties of Religious Experience (still the best book on the topic, it laid the groundwork for a psychology of ecstatic experiences, although it showed a strong individualist bias)\nEmile Durkheim, The Elementary Forms of Religious Life (this book recognized the communal importance of \u2018collective effervescence\u2019 for bonding societies together)\nJonathan Haidt, The Righteous Mind (this recent work of social psychology builds on Durkheim to explore how ecstatic experiences bind us together, but Haidt also recognizes this communal binding can be dangerous and delusional)\nBarbara Ehrenreich, Dancing in the Streets (the popular sociologist has explored ecstatic experiences in several of her books, including the ecstasy of war and violence in Blood Rites, her own ecstatic experience in Living with a Wild God, and this exploration of ecstasy through collective dancing).\nAldous Huxley, Moksha (Huxley shaped our cultural understanding of psychedelics \u2014 indeed, he helped to coin the word. He was unrivalled in his ability to think about ecstatic experiences at multiple levels, from the chemical to the psychological to the historical, cultural and political).\nAnn Taves, Fits, Trances and Visions (a very good study of changing historical attitudes to ecstatic experiences in the US from the 18th to the early 20th century)\nJeffrey Kripal, The Flip (Kripal is a pioneer of the \u2018mystical humanities\u2019 and has long emphasized the need for a careful hermeneutics of contemporary ecstatic experiences, in which we read such experiences as cultural texts, while also being open to their mysteriousness)\nSam Harris, Waking Up (a good naturalistic account of spiritual experiences, and a recognition by a leading atheist of their importance and value)\nStanislav and Christina Grof (editors), Spiritual Emergency (this important collection of essays explores spiritual experiences which are psychologically difficult, disturbing and even quasi-psychotic, and how such experiences can best be managed by individuals and therapists).\nIsabel Clarke (editor), Psychosis and Spirituality (this is a great collection of essays on the overlap between psychosis and spirituality).\nCharles Tart (editor), Altered States of Consciousness ( a pioneering collection of psychological essays from 1969)\nCarl Jung, Man and his Symbols (ecstatic experiences sometimes involve symbolic and mythological content, which can be interpreted psychologically, as Jung first explored)\nMichael Pollan, How To Change Your Mind (the book that helped to spark the current psychedelic renaissance)\nOther recent books on this domain of experience include my own books, The Art of Losing Control, and Breaking Open Finding A Way Through Spiritual Emergency (co-edited with Tim Read); and Stealing Fire, by Jamie Wheal and Steven Kotler.

Why is Costa Rica so expensive? Because narco violence forced rich gringos out of the Mexican coast and down to the Costa Rican coast. Why are there so many sky scrapers in Panama City? Because Colombian narco-traffickers used the city to launder their huge profits. The estuary of drug money and violence runs through the entire continent.\nBut we all see the narco economy through myths, or what one writer called the \u2018narco-imaginary\u2019. I\u2019ve been watching the Netflix series, Narcos, which brought narco culture to millions of viewers. As I watched series after series, I wondered: how true is the version of history that Narcos and Narcos: Mexico presents to us? Are the DEA definitely the good guys, or could they actually be the unwitting bad guys here, disrupting organized crime and creating violently disorganized crime in their Quixotic quest for a world free of drugs?\nTo find out, I asked my friend, Professor Benjamin Smith of Warwick University. Ben has spent his working life studying Mexico, writing four books about it. The latest is The Dope: The Real History of the Mexican Drug Trade. Ben spent years in Mexican archives, interviewed over 30 DEA agents, and pieced together the history of the Mexican drugs trade going back a century. We discussed five myths that Narcos propagates about the narco economy.\nThe drugs trade is run by corporation-like cartels\n\nNarcos propagates the idea of drug cartels as these discrete commercial units, like corporations, which manage the entire drugs business from growing to distributing and selling. \u2018Cocaine Inc\u2019, as the media dubbed the Cali cartel in the 1980s. But Smith says:\nThe Mexican cartel is something very different. It\u2019s like the Mafia. It\u2019s an organization that charges everyone in a drugs economy for protection. They\u2019re less like a corporation and more like a quasi-state, an organized extortion system. And they demand extortion money just the drugs market but for any market \u2014 coffee, avocados, restaurants, you name it.\nIndeed, he says he first got the impulse to investigate and write about the drugs trade, and realized it was something that was affecting the whole of Mexican society, when a friend of his who ran a famous bar in Oaxaca was killed by the Zeta gang, for refusing to pay an extortion tax. \u2018He had nothing to do with the drugs trade\u2019, Ben says.\nA lot of the violence in Mexico in the last 20 years hasn\u2019t been so much for control of the drugs trade, he says, as for control of these quasi-state protection rackets. What is the policy implication of this analysis?\nWeirdly this comes down to taxes. The government has made a decision not to have a huge tax base. What it needs to do is increase that tax base, increase the power of the state, and take away this rival tax group.\n2) Take out the king-pins\n\nAnother myth propagated by every series of Narcos is that the drugs trade is run by cartel bosses, \u2018king-pins\u2019, and that the best way to tackle drug crime is to take down the king-pins. That\u2019s the strategy you see in every narco drama, when they pin a bunch of photos on a wall, with arrows pointing to the master-mind at the top of the organization. Gradually, through the series, they get closer and closer to the king-pin, and then finally take him down, in a blaze of publicity.\nThis mirrors the actual strategy the DEA pursued. Smith says:\nThe king-pin strategy emerges somewhat organically when the DEA takes down Escobar and the Cali Cartel in Colombia in the 1980s, and by the early 1990s its written in stone: \u2018This is how we disrupt drug trafficking networks \u2014 we take out the people on the top\u2019. The idea being that thereby you reduce the drugs coming into the States. This strategy peaked in the 2010s in Mexico, where famously the Mexican government took out 130 of the 140 king-pins in the drugs trade, after which the homicide rate went through the roof and the price of drugs on the street went through the floor. So effectively what this is, is very good for the right-wing media. But in actual fact it\u2019s incredibly ineffective for bringing down addiction rates, overdose rates or homicide rates, or for raising the price of drugs.\nIn fact, one paper suggests that violence rises after a king-pin is taken down, as it disrupts a settled economy and increases competition. The other reason violence may spike is that, to bring down a king-pin, the DEA encourages and coerces members of a drugs network to inform on each other. Smith says:\nIt\u2019s difficult to infiltrate closed networks of narcotraffickers. You need informants to do it. That informant slips apart the bonds of trust on which these networks are based. This causes enormous amounts of distrust and paranoia, and they end up killing each other. The classic example would be Chapo Guzman of the Sinaloa Cartel \u2014 a big cartel where they\u2019re all related. In 2009, he sells out some of his compadres, and as a result, the Cartel splits apart and start killing each other. That\u2019s deliberately engineered by the DEA. It leads to loads of arrests but more killing and no reduction in the consumption of drugs.\nThis brings us to myth three.\n3) America is an innocent and virtuous victim of the barbarians at its borders, and the DEA are noble knights fighting the evil narco monsters\n\nIn some ways, and with some qualifications, this is the story that Narcos tells. Yes, Narcos does show the machinations of the CIA, and the collaboration of the DEA with Colombian paramilitaries, but nonetheless, the story is narrated by DEA agents, from their view-point. The series\u2019 show advisor is ex-DEA agent James Kuykendall, and he is a \u2018big promoter of the DEA and its mission\u2019 according to Smith.\nSmith says:\nThis is one of the last remaining myths of the drugs war: the DEA are the good guys taking down the really evil people, the mass-murdering psychopaths. But what I suggest is the DEA helped create these mass murdering psychopaths.\nHe found an \u2018old boy\u2019s network\u2019 of DEA agents and interviewed around 30 of them. He says that, on the whole, they are bitter, angry, and even \u2018broken\u2019 over their role in the failed war on drugs. \u2018They\u2019re often Mexican-Americans, and they\u2019ve spent their whole career putting away people who look like them. They got into the DEA out of a sense of mission \u2014 perhaps a loved one died of an overdose. But they feel that what they\u2019ve done doesn\u2019t actually help.\u2019\nAnd what they did wasn\u2019t always legal. He says:\nThe DEA has a very loose remit, it has looser rules than the US military or the State Department. It basically flits from being a diplomatic arm of the US to doing active investigations. A lot of them are semi-illegal. A lot of their work in Mexico is entrapment, which is illegal.\nDid they use torture or extra-judicial killings? \u2018It\u2019s difficult to know. We know that in Mexico, extricating confessions through torture has gone through the roof since the 1970s, when the DEA got involved with Mexican drug policing.\u2019\nNarcos shows the supply side of the economy, but doesn\u2019t focus much on the demand side \u2014 ie the United States\u2019 bottomless demand for mood-altering drugs, particularly since the 1960s counterculture, which Smith describes as \u2018jet fuel for the Mexican drugs economy\u2019. He adds:\nI recently read a book called Deviant Capitalism, which argues that a lot of what we now think of as neoliberal capitalism is introduced by the hippy counterculture. They turn up in villages around the world, throwing around money, and suddenly these villages are hooked into a globalized market. You\u2019ve got a village in Afghanistan producing the weed smoked in San Francisco. It\u2019s a weird mixture of capitalism and exoticization of the foreign. It\u2019s the modern disease, in a way.\nThe American demand for drugs is itself connected to the weak medical and welfare system in the United States. Illegal drugs are a quick way to medicate mental and physical pain, in the absence of affordable healthcare.\nAnd it\u2019s also the case that one American export has been flowing into Mexico and causing hundreds of thousands of deaths: guns.\nSmith notes that in 2004, the US changed its gun laws to make it easier to purchase certain types of guns. A year later, Mexican drug-related homicides started to soar. A researcher in president Obrador\u2019s government has done research suggesting that, a few months before every big cartel war, there\u2019s a massive bump in gun sales in the city over the border.\nSmith tells me:\nIt\u2019s really noticeable. Even here in southern Mexico, I meet mates who are now tooled up. No one had a gun when I first came to Mexico. It has one gun store, on a military base. Yet it has some of the highest levels of gun ownership in the world. In the 1990s, 17% of murders were caused by firearms, most people were killed with machetes. Now it\u2019s 80% of murders. It\u2019s way easier to kill people with guns, and it\u2019s far more likely that random passers-by will also get shot.\nNow, the Mexican government is trying to flip the script: The president of Mexico has attempted to change the narrative: it\u2019s not Mexican drugs killing American youths, it\u2019s American guns killing Mexican youths. The government has even brought a civil court case against US gun manufacturers, who they are suing for $10 billion.\nSo we should question the story of the virtuous Americans and the degenerate Latinos at their periphery, which one finds in so many western narco-stories. There is corruption, vice and human frailty on both sides of the borders.\n4) Kiki Camarena was killed by psycho narcos, supported by corrupt Mexican politicians, and this led to the redemptive violence of the American war on drugs\n\nThis is the story told in season one of Narcos: Mexico. It tells the true story of DEA agent Enrique \u2018Kiki\u2019 Camarena, who was abducted, tortured and murdered in 1985. His torture and murder caused outrage in the American media and spurred Washington to launch a new round of its war on drugs. Three leading members of the Guadalajara Cartel were arrested for his murder.\nIn Narcos: Mexico the blame is laid at the feet of Rafael Caro Quintero, a member of the cartel. He\u2019s portrayed to be a drug-crazed out-of-control Mexican Indian, who is used by shadowy figures high in the Mexican government who fear that Kiki knows too much.\nThis doesn\u2019t make any sense. Why would a government minister order the killing of a DEA agent, which would spark a major crackdown? Ben says: \u2018Was Camarena killed because he revealed that figures in the Mexican government were involved in the drug trade? People knew that already.\u2019\nWhy was there such a massive media and political reaction to his death? Smith says:\nDEA agents died in Mexico all the time. They got shot all the time. But Kiki\u2019s death was brilliant for the Reagan-era war on drugs. It cleansed the DEA of two charges. One, being racist \u2014 Kiki was a Mexican. And two, torture \u2014 because Kiki was tortured. When it happened, the DEA was losing power in the military and the FBI. Kiki\u2019s tragic death was used as a brilliant piece of propaganda for the drugs war.\nWho was behind his killing? We don\u2019t know. One theory is that he \u2018may have revealed that the CIA was using Mexican narcos to sell drugs into the US then channel the profits to the Contras in Nicaragua.\u2019 In fact, an ex-DEA agent, Hector Bellerez, has supported this theory in an Amazon docuseries, The Last Narc, which also criticizes James Kuykendell for his policing. Kuykendell is now suing Amazon and Bellerez. So you have two ex-DEA agents putting forward two different theories of who killed Kiki Camarena, one in an Amazon series, the other in a Netflix series. That gives us some sense of how murky \u2018true crime\u2019 TV\u2019s version of history can be.\n5) The drugs trade is always brutally violent\nIn some ways we want it to be so. Narco culture has become like video games \u2014 a dream zone where men, hemmed in by feminism and bureaucratic capitalism, can play out their fantasies of unfettered male violence and excess. But the Mexican drugs trade wasn\u2019t always as violent as it is today.\nThere are two aspects to the Mexican drugs market \u2014 trafficking to the US, and selling it at home. Before the 1990s, Ben argues, there was barely any domestic drugs market. There was an unofficial arrangement between the drug traffickers and the government \u2014 sell the drugs abroad, and we won\u2019t come down on you hard. If narco traffickers got caught, they spent a year or two in prison.\nThree things changed from the 1980s onwards. First, the DEA started to take the \u2018war on drugs\u2019 a lot more seriously. They infiltrated drug networks and got narcos to inform on each other, with various forms of coercion including the threat of long sentences in US prisons and the seizure of narcos\u2019 assets.\nSmith tells me:\nTrafficking involves cooperation and trust. It helps if they\u2019re friends or compadres or a family network. It doesn\u2019t tend to be very violent, until the DEA infiltrates you, turns your compadres into informants and threatens to extradite you, which raises the stakes. Before the 1990s, what\u2019s the point of selling out your mates for a few years in a Mexican prison. There\u2019s very little violence connected to trafficking until the 1990s. After the 1990s, if the DEA are going to put you in a US prison for decades and take all your money, you might as well sell out your compadres.\nOnce the narco traffickers started to inform on each other, they also started to kill each other, and the trade became a lot more violent.\nSecond, the protection racket economy became more fragmented, as the PRI ruling party lost its monopoly on power. Third, drug gangs became much richer, through the sale of Colombian cocaine into the US, and they started to replace the state as the chief extortioner / taxer in some regions. Fourth, competing gangs started to sell in Mexico \u2014 to tourists and to locals \u2014 and to fight for local drug turfs. The competition for that domestic market is what has driven a lot of the violence of the last decade.\nThe situation today is very bad \u2014 rough estimates suggest 150,000 Mexicans have been killed in drug-related violence in the last 20 years. Journalists, politicians, students, tourists, no one is safe from the violence. But history teaches us nothing lasts forever. In Colombia, for example, I visited Medellin in February, which once had one of the highest homicide rates in the world. Now, its homicide rates are below where they were before the cocaine business took off. The city has been revitalized, for the time being, by a canny combination of deals between the competing gangs, and state-backed welfare and public infrastructure projects. The infamous Barrio 13 is now the site of tourist tours and craft beer bars. The gangs are still there, they still extort local businesses, but for now the neighbourhood is flourishing, relatively speaking.\nBen is not holding his breath that a similar renaissance is right around the corner for Mexico. President Obrador has declared the war on drugs over and says he plans to legalize marijuana. But Smith thinks:\nIn all honesty, I\u2019m not entirely sure it will do a lot of good. At the least, people with minor drug infractions won\u2019t go to jail. And it will stop some of the street fights over marijuana. That\u2019s obviously a good thing. But unless you legalize meth, crack and heroin, it\u2019s a drop in the ocean. It won\u2019t help people who are taking drugs because they\u2019re in deep psychological and physical pain. What you really need is proper medical and social services. It\u2019s not a coincidence that at the same time the NHS is going through a crisis and it\u2019s very difficult to get a therapy appointment, the UK is also going through an overdose crisis.\nAnd the gangs are not just in the drugs business. They\u2019re mainly in the extortion business. To combat that, Ben suggests you need a stronger state with a bigger tax base. But then, a series called Taxes would probably attract fewer viewers than Narcos.\nYou can watch my interview with Professor Benjamin Smith below, and buy his book here.\n", "comment_count": 7, "like_count": 130, "created_time": 1650072931423, "comment": [{"user_id": "5b52999d576", "comment_time": 1650072931423, "comment": "Thank you for sharing!"}, {"user_id": "4e818eac0c5", "comment_time": 1650085245765, "comment": "Pity Netflix missed the opportunity to reveal the complicated truth about the war on drugs as you describe the myths about that failure instead of presenting simplistic DEA propaganda.

Includes pandas set() operations.\nImage by Author\nBackground\nWastewater (sewer) data can be used as an early warning for COVID-19 cases. This is a well-developed technology that counts fragments of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the wastewater, compares the count to previous values in the same region to detect increase/decrease, and can even sequence the RNA to determine virus variants.\nThe two most comprehensive sets of data for wastewater tracking in the United States are compiled and held by CDC National Wastewater Surveillance System (NWSS) and Biobot Analytics. (There are other data sources in the US that are more localized, such as a state or university.)\nBut looking at the raw CDC and Biobot datasets can be frustrating. They have different layouts, use Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) county codes rather than readable names, and are not in a logical order by location. It is difficult to see if they contain a county you want to look up and hard to tell if a particular county is in one or both files (or neither). And they are not visual at all: Which parts of the US are well-represented in the data and which are missing?\nI recently completed a data engineering project to answer these questions. The goals were:\nCreate alphabetical lists of the counties in each dataset.\nCreate alphabetical lists of the counties that overlap both sources and span both \u2014 the intersection and union.\nMake an interactive map of the US showing which wastewater dataset covers each county. Use color-coding to quickly see areas with sparse data.\nSince the datasets and county coverages change fairly often, I will rerun this code and update the map weekly.\nData Engineering\nThe Python/pandas code for this project is intuitively simple: drop all information about the water tests except for county FIPS code; add readable state-county names; use Python set() operations to create the county lists; and output a file with this information that will become input for the map. Of course, most programming projects that should be simple have a wrinkle or two, and this one is no exception.\nTo drop the many columns of data we don\u2019t care about, pandas gives two options: list the fields to remove or the fields to keep. In this case, the latter is much easier.\nNwssDF = NwssDF[[\"county_fips\"]]  # don't need any other columns\nBiobotDF = BiobotDF[[\"fipscode\"]]  # don't need any other columns\nThe NWSS dataset has a tricky wrinkle. The county_fips field sometimes contains more than one FIPS code, such as \"['08013', '08123']\". In relational database terms, this violates First Normal Form. For our purposes, this format makes it impossible to join the file with any other data keyed by FIPS code.\nThe fix is to explode these rows so each has just one FIPS code, and then clean up the surrounding characters.\nNwssDF[\"county_fips\"] = NwssDF[\"county_fips\"].str.split(\",\")\n \nNwssDF = NwssDF.explode(\"county_fips\")  \nNwssDF[\"county_fips\"] = NwssDF[\"county_fips\"].str.strip(\"[]' \") \nThe Biobot dataset also contains a wrinkle, which is that it suppresses leading zeroes on FIPS codes. So the data has 9001 for Fairfield CT, rather than the correct 09001. Biobot has committed to fixing this problem, but until then, this code solves the issue.\nBiobotDF.loc[BiobotDF[\"fipscode\"].str.len() == 4, \"fipscode\"] = \\\n\"0\" + BiobotDF[\"fipscode\"] \nUse the FIPS codes to join/merge a field that contains the readable string STATE | COUNTY | FIPS, which will be useful in the county lists and on the map. Details for how to do this are in the source code and my recent article about FIPS codes and county names.\nUse Python set() operations to get the various county sets:\nall_counties = set(AllCountiesDF[\"STATE_COUNTY_FIPS\"])\nbiobot_counties = set(BiobotDF[\"STATE_COUNTY_FIPS\"])\nnwss_counties = set(NwssDF[\"STATE_COUNTY_FIPS\"])\nbiobot_nwss_union = biobot_counties.union(nwss_counties)\nbiobot_nwss_intersection = \\ biobot_counties.intersection(nwss_counties)\nbiobot_only = biobot_counties.difference(nwss_counties)\nnwss_only = nwss_counties.difference(biobot_counties)\nmissing_counties = all_counties.difference(biobot_nwss_union)\nWrite the sets to output files using the sorted() function that turns a set into an alphabetical list and the * operator to separate a list for printing. Like:\nwith open(BIOBOT_LIST_FILE, 'w') as f:\n    print(*sorted(biobot_counties), file=f, sep=\"\\n\")\nWhich yields the readable county files: NWSS, Biobot, NWSS only, Biobot only, intersection, union, and missing (not in NWSS or Biobot).\nFinally, create a DataFrame and output file that will be input to the map.\nMapDF = AllCountiesDF # copy of DF with all US counties\nMapDF[\"WBE_WHO\"] = \"none\" # default for \"who has wastewater data\"\nMapDF.loc[MapDF[\"STATE_COUNTY_FIPS\"].isin(biobot_only), \n\"WBE_WHO\"] = \"biobot\"  # Biobot only\nMapDF.loc[MapDF[\"STATE_COUNTY_FIPS\"].isin(nwss_only), \n\"WBE_WHO\"] = \"nwss\"  # NWSS only\nMapDF.loc[MapDF[\"STATE_COUNTY_FIPS\"].isin(biobot_nwss_intersection), \n\"WBE_WHO\"] = \"biobot-nwss\"  # both\nMapDF = MapDF.rename(columns={\"CountyFIPS\":\"FIPS\"}) \n# to match Flourish naming\n    \nMapDF.to_csv(MAP_FILE, encoding='utf-8', sep='\\t', index=False)\nMaking the Map\nMuch of the work for producing the map is done by the Flourish software, which provides a non-programming interface to create visualizations, including maps. Flourish already has the geometry for US counties, simple settings to fill regions with color codes, and automatic pop-ups when a user hovers over a region.\nHere is how to create the same map I made, which you are free to modify\u2026\nCreate an account at https://flourish.studio.\nCreate a New Visualization. Scroll down to US Counties and choose it as your starting point. Give your map a name in the upper left.\nGo to Preview / Points Layer and disable it. You also can remove all the associated data at Data / Points if you want.\nGo to Data / Regions and remove the existing column entries for Name, Label, Value and Group. You will assign new values for these.\nIn Data / Regions, remove every column except Geometry and FIPS. Your map is now pared down to just county outlines, ready to receive the wastewater data.\nChange the Upload option to Upload Data And Merge. Upload/merge the map data file you created (or copied) above. Make sure the merge column is FIPS for both the existing and incoming data.\nIn Data / Regions, set Geometry = the geometry column (probably A); Name = the STATE_COUNTY_FIPS column (probably C); and Value = the WBE_WHO column (probably D).\nIn Preview / Regions, set Scale Type = Categorical. Choose a color palette. (I used custom overrides with hex color values, but this is not necessary.)\nIn Preview / Footer, set data source names and URLs.\nIn Export & Publish, you can publish the map on the Flourish server and get a public URL to it, and/or download an image file in PNG or JPG.\nFuture Work\nTwo valuable extensions to this work would be:\nAdd more counties in the US. It would be great to see the entire map of the country filled in with wastewater tracking, and the water test results would serve as a reliable predictor for coming COVID-19 cases and where they will hit. The CDC is actively working on this and the number of counties covered does increase month by month.\nAdd more countries from the whole world. There are two projects (cited below) that are tracking international wastewater testing, and the number of countries they cover is increasing steadily. An important component of this effort, however, is the creation of a single, unified dataset of all international test results for easy analysis and visualization.\nFor More Information\nhttps://biobot.io/data/ (Biobot data)\nhttps://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/NWSS-Public-SARS-CoV-2-Wastewater-Data/2ew6-ywp6 (CDC NWSS data)\nhttps://ucmerced.maps.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/c778145ea5bb4daeb58d31afee389082 and https://sphere.waterpathogens.org/map (international wastewater maps)\nhttps://twitter.com/COVIDPoops19 (popular Twitter feed about wastewater from UC-Merced)\nhttps://help.flourish.studio/category/10-flourish-basics (getting started with Flourish)", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 2, "created_time": 1648223370941, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Data Engineering", "Data Visualization", "Pandas", "Covid 19", "Flourish"]}, {"author": "Chuck Connell", "post_id": "9717d8197f98", "user_id": "c4e1ad08794e", "title": "SARS-CoV-2 Wastewater Data, Enhanced", "content": "SARS-CoV-2 Wastewater Data, Enhanced\nCombining CDC\u2019s wastewater data with COVID-19 vaccinations, hospitalizations and deaths\nPhoto by Fusion Medical Animation on Unsplash\nBackground\nThere has been a lot of press coverage lately about tracking the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes the COVID-19 disease, in wastewater (sewer systems). A strong link has been established between spikes in wastewater virus and spikes in disease about a week later. As just one example, this chart shows the virus signal (dark blue) across various water treatment facilities in the United States versus known US COVID-19 cases (light blue).\nImage from biobot.io/data/, used with permission\nRecently the National Wastewater Surveillance System (NWSS) of the US CDC released public data about the wastewater infomation they gather. Their dashboard provides a nice summary of the data and introduction to the topic.\nNWSS also makes available two detailed datasets that show every laboratory test performed on wastewater and its results. These datasets contain many columns of information, including:\nName and location of the water treatment facility\nDate and time the sample was gathered\nCounties and population that drain into that sewer\nTypes of tests performed on the sewage\nThe identity of the lab that did the tests\nNumerical results of the tests for RNA fragments\nThese datasets are available to researchers who sign a data-use agreement to protect confidential personal information they might contain. (With a small sewer system it might be possible to infer the names of people who are sick.)\nThe two detailed datasets differ in that one, named raw, contains just the facts, while the other, analytical, has many columns of statistical results that may help scientists analyze the data.\nA Problem\nAs valuable as the detailed CDC wastewater data is, it is lacking in one key area \u2014 correlation to additional real-world COVID-19 data such as vaccination and disease outcomes. The datasets do have information about known cases in the area, but simple case counts are notoriously unreliable. Many sick people never get a government-reported PCR test; the availability of testing varies month to month; people tend to rush out for testing when there are scary news reports; and home tests are not reported to government health departments. The more accurate measures of disease severity are hospitalization rates, ICU admissions and mortality.\nA simple approach would be to join wastewater data with vaccination rates and disease outcomes from the same day the wastewater sample was collected, but this would not be helpful. Vaccination offers no reduction in disease resistance on the day of the jab. People who get sick rarely go to the hospital on the first day they have symptoms. When, unfortunately, someone dies of COVID-19, that usually occurs days after they enter a hospital.\nTo see how vaccination influences SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater, we need to look at various vaccination rates (first shot, full vaccine, booster) some number of days before the wastewater is collected. To see how wastewater predicts hospitalizations, we need to look at hospital data after the water test. To correlate wastewater with mortality, we need an even longer time delta.\nSolution\nA recent data engineering project I undertook addresses these issues. It generates an enhanced version of the NWSS detailed datasets with vaccination, hospitalization and deaths in that area, and the dates for these facts are before or after the water tests. For example, in a data row that describes a water sample gathered on September 15 in Arenac County, Michigan, there is a column added for full vaccination rate in that county on September 5 and another added for ICU admits there on September 29.\nThe setback/set-ahead dates are easily adjustable, and it is quick to regenerate the dataset with a 21 day setback for first vaccination and a 28 day set-ahead for mortality, for example.\nAnother problem solved by my dataset is that most US COVID-19 health data is organized at the county level (or state or country). However, water treatment plants often handle sewage from more than one county. My code reformats the NWSS detail files so that each row shows just one county, to make it easier to join the datasets with available health outcome data.\nHere is one enhanced row, showing a few key columns, turned vertically for readability:\nCountyFIPS = 08069\npcr_gene_target = n1\nsample_collect_date = 2022-01-20\npcr_target_units = copies/l wastewater\npcr_target_avg_conc = 490473.59\nvax_date = 2022-01-10.  # 10 days before water sample\nmetrics.vaccinationsInitiatedRatio = 0.724\nmetrics.vaccinationsCompletedRatio = 0.656\nmetrics.vaccinationsAdditionalDoseRatio = 0.324\ncases_date = 2022-01-27. # 7 days after water sample\nmetrics.caseDensity100k = 155.5\nmetrics.testPositivityRatio = 0.214\nhosp_date = 2022-02-03.  # 14 days after water sample\nactuals.icuBeds.currentUsageCovid = 13\nactuals.hospitalBeds.currentUsageCovid = 91\ndeaths_date = 2022-02-10.  # 21 days after water sample\nactuals.newDeaths = 2\nLarger anonymized samples of the enhanced detailed datasets are on my github for the raw and analytical data. Each has 1000 random rows and all the columns.\nReplicating This Result\nTo build your own enhanced NWSS detailed dataset:\nDownload or clone the Python/pandas source code.\nApply to NWSS for access to the detailed datasets of wastewater samples. The contact information for the data owner is on the data description page. Note that this page describes the summarized public NWSS data, but the contact is the same.\nDownload COVID-19 vaccination and outcome data, and US county populations, as shown in the source code comments. These will be joined with the NWSS detailed datasets to make the enhanced versions.\nThe code and sample data are posted under the MIT license, which requires only attribution to reuse or modify the work.\nFuture Work\nThis project created the datasets described here, but did not perform any specific analysis on them. An obvious next step is to use the enhanced datasets to look for correlations between wastewater results and ICU admissions, or whether the first vaccine or full vaccination has more effect on wastewater virus, or the optimum time delta for one of these events to predict another.\nThe data discussed here is for the United States. There is also wastewater testing around the world for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The sites doing this detection are shown on dashboards from University of California at Merced and the Global Water Pathogens Project. A valuable extension to my work would be to create a single global dataset that combines all the wastewater detection sites shown on the maps and to enhance that data with cases, hospitalizations, ICU and mortality. In other words, to create the same dataset presented above for the whole world.\nData Notes\nThere are a couple data model items that may be confusing at first, so keep the following in mind as you look at the NWSS datasets:\nIn the raw file, the sample_id field is sometimes repeated on more than one row. This occurs when the same water sample is tested for more than one gene target, such as N1 and N2.\nIn the analytical file, the sample_id field is often blank. This occurs when there is no water sample on that date in that location, so the data row is used to hold COVID-19 case statistics for the day. My enhancement code removes these blank sample_id rows, since I add case outcome information directly onto the sample rows using the date of the sample.\nCredit\nThank you to Amy Kirby and the NWSS data owner at CDC for helpful discussions and access to the detailed datasets, to Colleen Naughton and Claire Duvallet for encouragement and pointers to other research related to watewater-based epidemiology, and to Mimi Alkattan for valuable review comments.\nFor More Information\nbiobot.io/data/ (Biobot dashboard) and biobot.io/blog/ (blog)\ntwitter.com/COVIDPoops19 (Twitter feed about tracking COVID-19 through wastewater from UC-Merced and Colleen Naughton)", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 53, "created_time": 1645567455960, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Data Science", "Covid 19", "Sars Cov2", "Wbe"]}, {"author": "Chuck Connell", "post_id": "1e4c54dc9dff", "user_id": "c4e1ad08794e", "title": "The Ultimate State-County-FIPS Tool", "content": "The Ultimate State-County-FIPS Tool\nThe only tool you need for mapping USA FIPS codes to states, counties, abbreviations, and vice versa\nPhoto by KOBU Agency on Unsplash\nThe Problem\nWhen doing data science with geographic locations it is common to juggle USA FIPS codes, state names, county names, abbreviations, etc. There are various tables of this information scattered around the Internet, but every one I found is lacking in some way.

Here\u2019s the needlepoint string of geese that hung over her crib, handmade by her great grandmother. A few hours go by and I am digging into nursery school drawings, elementary school math sheets, middle school headbands. The high school stuff is overwhelming \u2014 photos, yearbooks, piles of letters, a tell tale cigarette lighter (likely not used for tobacco) and I\u2019m still only half way through my daughter\u2019s life in this house.\nWe plan a Face Time \u2014 she lives across the country \u2014 and as she sits with her own baby daughter nestled on her lap, I hold up posters, sweatshirts, two music boxes, and more, asking \u201cKeep? Toss?\u201d \u201cKeep? Toss?\u201d \u201cKeep? Toss?\u201d\nMind you, my daughter has already cleaned out her old room and so has her brother \u2014 at least twice. But that was just during their visits home, and we\u2019ve lived in this house more than 30 years. The layers run deep.\nNow, she\u2019s ready to let most of it go, except for an inexplicable attachment she has to a pair of tattered zebra-striped platform sneakers that she loved in the 90s.\nThis is a preliminary exercise in Death Cleaning. My husband and I are going through our own stuff as well as our kids\u2019. But now that I\u2019m in the midst of it, I have a new understanding of the concept of shedding our material goods.\nI first heard the term \u201cDeath Cleaning\u201d several years ago, when Margareta Magnusson, an 87-year-old woman, published \u201cThe Gentle Art of Swedish Death Cleaning.\u201d The basic idea is that your impending demise is reason enough to sort through your stuff and start purging.\nThink of it as a courtesy to the next generation, the one that will have to sort through all your accumulated stuff when you\u2019re gone. It\u2019s enough that we are leaving behind a planet whose very existence is threatened by climate change. Do we really want to add decades of accumulated books, drawers of outdated clothes, and multiple spatulas for them to cope with?\nBecause if you think my kids\u2019 rooms are full of stuff, you should see the rest of the house. I recently unearthed my maternity clothes. Don\u2019t get me going on the kitchen, where I have at least six water pitchers, three cake stands and more mugs than shelf space. The basement \u2014 where everything in the house goes to die \u2014 is almost too frightening to contemplate.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong \u2014 I am not planning on meeting my Maker anytime soon. But we are thinking of moving. And downsizing is like a dress rehearsal for Death Cleaning.The concept, I now realize, has a more subtle meaning, at least it does for me right now. It\u2019s about the passing of a particular stage of life.\nWe are not young parents raising a family. We\u2019re not even middle-aged parents whose kids come home from college. We are the parents of adults who are beginning to have kids of their own.\nOur house belongs to a life that is no longer ours.\nMy kids\u2019 rooms remained untouched for years after they moved out. My son\u2019s room was a shrine to The New York Rangers \u2014 posters everywhere, framed jerseys, boxed and signed hockey pucks. In my daughter\u2019s room, the canopy bed that I slept in as a child is nestled alongside the window. My grandmother\u2019s dressing table is against the opposite wall. Until we began tackling it, every surface in both rooms was covered and every drawer stuffed.\nWe are dismantling the years they grew up in this house \u2014 and it does feel like a kind of death. Slowly the kids\u2019 childhoods are being stripped from these rooms. Their wall paper \u2014 where my son affixed stickers and my daughter hung posters with tacks \u2014 is coming down. They will be painted an inoffensive shade of off-white, so that prospective buyers can imagine their own lives in these rooms.\nWhat do we leave behind? In a literal sense, we will eventually leave a staged house with neutral colors and not much personality. It will be easier to move on when this place no longer looks like us.\nI already have to turn my head away when I walk past my son\u2019s old room. Gaping empty shelves stare back where a larger-than-life cardboard cutout of Wayne Gretzky use to stand guard, stick down, ready to take a shot. I not only miss The Great One in his blue and red uniform but also everything he meant to a hockey-crazed boy.\nWhat do we ultimately leave behind? The love we\u2019ve given to others. Memories of course. What I\u2019m not sure of is how much of that love and those memories are embedded in the material things.\nI\u2019m looking around my office where I have a dented, engraved mug that once belonged to my paternal grandfather. A pretty china cat that was my maternal grandmother\u2019s sits on a shelf. Another shelf is entirely dedicated to photos of people in my life that I have loved and lost.\nBut what of the big cardboards boxes that I know sit in the basement? My maternal grandparents, born at the end of the 19th century, lived in Texas and loved to roam the country side. One box contains rusted cowbells and scraps of barbed wire that they picked up in their travels. A chipped vase from Mexico. A stained, embroidered tablecloth. Do these things keep my grandparents\u2019 memory alive, or do they weigh me down?\nAnd what will my own children do with rusted cowbells and barbed wire? They never even met their great grandparents \u2014 could these things possibly have meaning for them? Can any actual thing?\nI remember once hearing a preacher say that he\u2019d never seen a funeral with a U-Haul attached to the hearse. Ultimately we have to let go \u2014 of our youth, of our middle age, of everything including, ultimately, our lives\u2014 whether we deal with it ahead of time or not.\nThis week, as I grow multiple piles labeled \u201cKeep\u201d \u201cDonate\u201d and \u201cToss,\u201d I can\u2019t help but think of the Ukrainian refugees \u2014 and refugees everywhere \u2014 for whom deciding what is precious and can be carried on their backs is a life and death decision in real time.\nWhat a privilege and conceit it is to have the leisure to think all this through.\nI\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019d leave the rusty cow bells and the middle school poetry behind.

Aren\u2019t you brilliant?! I wish I knew you!\u201d\nI\u2019m kidding.\nPeople, please stop. What makes you believe that anyone is interested in how well you did on this daily puzzle? Many, many things are wrong with posting your scores on social media, but I\u2019ll just hit the key ones:\nOne: You know and we know that it\u2019s only when you perform well that you post your score. I have yet to see anyone sharing the news that even after all six attempts, they were unable to guess the word. In fact, a score of three or below is the general threshold for being post-worthy. (If you are posting that you got it in four tries, you need to know that it\u2019s nothing to brag about.)\nTwo: Did I mention bragging? This is not even faux-bragging. It\u2019s straight-up boasting about your combination of verbal and reasoning skills, mixed in with some luck. As such, it\u2019s obnoxious.\nThree: Can you see that there is just a tiny bit of narcissism in assuming that your entire social network is interested in your Wordle score? I can already picture the next generation of car decals. Instead of \u201cHarvard\u201d or \u201cProud Parent of an Honor Student,\u201d they will read, \u201cAverage Wordle Score 2022\u2014 2!\u201d\nThis excessive score posting brings to mind football legend Jim Brown, who \u2014 when commenting on the crazy touchdown dances and displays favored by younger players, commented drily, \u201cWhen you get to the end zone, act like you\u2019ve been there before.\u201d\nGet it? If you are so excited about a good Wordle score, it clearly implies that it\u2019s a novelty.\nFull disclosure \u2014 I am a very competitive person. I play a lot of online word games. A lot. It\u2019s soothing for me and \u2014 forgive me for saying so \u2014 I\u2019m good at them. Currently, I\u2019m addicted to Wordscapes, a form of online Boggle. I play in a tournament every weekend. It galls me when I am outplayed by people with user names like \u201cBooBooBunny\u201d and \u201cSexySocks4.\u201d (If you\u2019re out there, \u201cTiredKate\u201d is gunning for you.) But it\u2019s anonymous and fun, and the silly player names work as an antidote for taking the whole thing too seriously.\nAnd I do play Wordle. Everyday my adult kids and I exchange our scores on a group text. The accompanying banter is friendly and encouraging, i.e. \u201cWhoa! That was a hard one!\u201d or \u201cGreat job, Paul!\u201d It\u2019s a nice check-in amongst a family of admitted word nerds, but it is not a general braying of accomplishments to the great beyond.\nSo folks, keep it to yourself.

Lessons from Great Writers Who Lost It All\nAnd why sometimes losing your work is a good thing\nShutterstock\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t back up?\nThose are words you should never say to anyone who has lost days, weeks, or years of work on a computer. Most of us who have experienced the stomach plunging, heart-racing, dry-throated realization that everything you\u2019ve been laboring on is gone \u2014 just gone\u2014 have learned this the hard way. (And yes, I now back up to the cloud and an external hard drive.)\nBut what about writers of yesteryear who worked with paper and pen? Their products may not have vanished from a computer screen and into the ether, but nonetheless, the written word was no more secure. And they have lessons for the rest of us about how to handle the loss.\nWas it a form of literary criticism or the an act of deranged marital vandalism? Robert Lewis Stevenson, debilitated by tuberculosis and maddened by medicinal cocaine, didn\u2019t have time to think it though. When Stevenson\u2019s wife Fanny burned his only draft of \u201cThe Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,\u201d he frantically wrote the story all over again in three days. From his invalid bed. All 30,000 words of it. By hand.\nFanny\u2019s culpability in destroying the original manuscript only came to light 115 years later. In a letter written in 1885 to the poet W. E. Henley, a friend of the couple, Fanny described the work as \u201ca quire full of utter nonsense\u201d and added, \u201cI shall burn it after I show it to you.\u201d She called the now-classic horror story \u201cdistasteful\u201d and felt it beneath her husband\u2019s ability.\nThe re-constituted story was a sensation and an instant best-seller. At the time, preachers even included the concept of man\u2019s duality in their sermons. The Stevensons were rescued from poverty by the success of the book and lived in relative comfort for the rest of their days.\nLesson: All criticism is not valid. Feedback can be helpful, but never trust only one person\u2019s opinion about your work. Also don\u2019t share your work near a fireplace.\nIt was probably not easy to be Hadley Richardson, Ernest Hemingway\u2019s first wife, for any number of reasons \u2014 but especially when she had to deliver the bad news. She was traveling from Paris to Switzerland to meet Hemingway for a vacation, and bringing along the manuscripts of all the stories he\u2019d ever written. She carried his work in a suitcase, but left it unaccompanied on the train to buy a drink at the station. When she returned, the case was gone. It was never recovered.\nHadley referred to her husband as \u201cthe great explosion of her life,\u201d and I wouldn\u2019t have wanted be nearby to hear him detonate when she told him about the lost work. Hemingway was unpublished at the time.\nHe wrote his friend Ezra Pound the following in 1923: \u201cI suppose you heard about the loss of my Juvenalia? I went up to Paris last week to see what was left and found that Hadley had made the job complete by including all carbons, duplicates, etc. All that remains of my complete works are three pencil drafts of a bum poem which was later scrapped, some correspondence between John McClure and me, and some journalistic carbons. You, naturally, would say, \u2018Good\u2019 etc. But don\u2019t say it to me. I ain\u2019t yet reached that mood.\u201d\nLesson: Hemingway went on to advocate a lean prose style, cutting out extraneous words and florid language. Maybe the sudden loss of his early work forced him to hone in on the essence of his word choice, to keep only what really mattered. In any event, Hadley and Ernest divorced five years later; she was the first of his four wives.\nImagine being Thomas Carlyle. He is the author of \u201cThe French Revolution,\u201d a comprehensive history of the epic multi-year drama. Like many writers, Carlyle lent his manuscript to a friend to get his feedback. That friend was the philosopher and writer John Stuart Mill. It was Mill\u2019s unhappy job to knock on Carlyle\u2019s door a few days later to inform him that he\u2019d carelessly left the manuscript sitting out. His maid had mistaken it for waste paper and used it as kindling to start a fire.\nCarlyle was reported to have taken the news fairly well. He simply began again.\nLesson: Sometimes the work we\u2019ve done is still in our heads. You think it\u2019s gone but it can be reconstructed with less difficulty than you thought, because you know the material so well. In addition, take deep breaths. Flying into a rage won\u2019t bring back your work. Neither will bashing your computer. Or bashing your friend. Also, you\u2019re using valuable energy that you need for re-writing.\nBottom line: Writers have always had it tough. Set backs happen. Start over.

Bush and Bill Clinton blew the opportunity of a lifetime to assist in shaping the former Soviet Union into a functioning democracy. But understandably, they could not overcome their aversion to helping a former enemy. Instead, the West gave Russia an official capitalist card, said \u201cWelcome to the club!\u201d, and told the new Russian Federation to figure democracy out on their own.\nNote: For an incredibly detailed breakdown of how the U.S. \u201ccreated\u201d Putin by treating Russia more like a vanquished enemy than a new ally, as well as expanding NATO in 1999, after promising we wouldn\u2019t, check out Vladimir Pozner\u2019s speech at Yale University.\n\nEven the tricky dick himself, Richard Nixon, warned Bush Sr. in 1992 to help Russia with its transition or face the consequences later. In a remarkable bit of foresight, Nixon warned us about the power vacuum in Russia being filled by an autocrat if the U.S. didn\u2019t step up.\nHow right Nixon was. Fortunately, he never lived to see his prediction come true.\nEnter Vladimir Putin \u2014 relic of the Cold War and shirtless equine aficionado.\nRussian Military Tech over the Past Decade\nIf you have been watching the news for the past decade, you have been subjected to stories of Putin\u2019s Russia developing next-gen super weapons like hypersonic missiles, nuclear torpedos, and satellite-killing robots. While the U.S. was toiling away in the Global War on Terror with our allies, Russia was presumably hard at work modernizing their Army and Navy.\nIndeed, China has been doing the very same thing. But unlike China, the public in the West was led to believe that Russian conventional forces were on par with their Western counterparts like the U.S. as well as the U.K. and other European nations.\nPhoto by Don Fontijn on Unsplash\nThis belief in a strong, modern Russian army and navy is perhaps the greatest irony of Putin\u2019s despicable attack on Ukraine. The invasion has shown the whole world just how weak the Russian military has become since the days of the formidable Soviet Red Army.\nUnderstanding Your Military\u2019s Capabilities Starts with Being Honest about Its Strengths and Weaknesses\nBeing honest with yourself about your strengths and weaknesses is the first step in the journey to self-improvement. In the United States military, we recognize and acknowledge our weaknesses in battle. Self-improvement is the very foundation of the \u201cdebrief\u201d in the U.S. Air Force and the \u201cafter-action report\u201d in the Army.\nAfter the mission, we ask:\nWhat went right?\nWhat went wrong?\nHow can we improve for future performance?\nThis willingness to ask questions for self-improvement not only makes our military more efficient at its primary mission (to close with and destroy the enemy), but it also saves lives on the battlefield.\nAmerica learned long ago that vast numbers of soldiers don\u2019t win wars. The war of attrition strategy that served Russia so well in the past is a concept long ago discarded by Western military planners in favor of high-tech weaponry.\nBy about 2010, Putin seemed to grasp this change in war fighting, at least conceptually. But he didn\u2019t have the political will or economic means to mass-produce Russia\u2019s recently developed weapons technology.\nGranted, Russia\u2019s fifth-generation fighter plane (the Sukhoi Su-57) and newest battlefield tank (the T-14 Armata) look great when they\u2019re paraded through Red Square. But when it\u2019s time to go to war, prototypes don\u2019t win engagements.\nPutin Is Using Outdated Equipment and Yes-Men as Decision Makers to Fight in Ukraine\nSo, in this attempt to annex a smaller country, what did Putin throw at Ukraine? His army is using 30-year-old Soviet equipment, with minor upgrades. This equipment has been so poorly maintained, that it\u2019s a miracle Russian forces have made it as far as they have. As any U.S. Army motor pool soldier or USAF flightline maintainer will tell you, it takes a lot of work and money to keep modern military equipment in operable, warfighting condition.\nThe invasion has shown the whole world just how weak the Russian military has become since the days of the formidable Soviet Red Army.\nAlthough, Russia\u2019s \u201cBuk\u201d class of medium-range surface-to-air missile platforms are more modern, and deadly, it appears that the majority of Russian equipment currently being fielded in Ukraine was built when Yuri Andropov was General Secretary.\nBuk-M1\u20132 SAM system. 9A310M1\u20132 self-propelled launcher. MAKS, Zhukovskiy, Russia, 2005. Public Domain.\nBut the problems plaguing the Russian armed forces go deeper than old equipment. I imagine that Russia\u2019s top generals paint a very rosy picture of their military readiness when they report to Putin, rather than tell him the truth and risk his ire.\nThis willingness to be yes-men shows the dangers of a country being led by an autocrat; everyone lies to the boss because no one wants to give him bad news. As a result, nothing gets fixed.\nBut Russia\u2019s generals don\u2019t just lie to the boss about the quality of their units. They lie to their soldiers just to get them to fight.\nRight now, there are stories coming out of Ukraine of captured Russian soldiers who were told that they would be greeted as saviors and liberators when they rolled into Ukraine. Imagine their surprise and dismay when they were confronted by lethal resistance.\n\nIt\u2019s as if their superiors set them up to fail. Indeed, one might almost feel sorry for the average Russian soldier if they weren\u2019t targeting civilians.\nThe Russian Army Has Command and Control Issues, As Well As Poor Supply Chain Planning\nIt\u2019s clear now that Russia\u2019s army has serious command and control issues, as well as poor supply chain planning.\nThe U.S. military isn\u2019t just made up of front-line combat troops. There is a massive support structure in place for those servicemembers, referred to as the \u201ctail-to-tooth\u201d ratio. Military historian Joseph Bond says that this \u201ctail-to-tooth\u201d ratio has changed a great deal from previous generations because the \u201ctail\u201d acts as a force multiplier.\nThe support structure includes:\nCommunications and information operations (IO) personnel, who allow for coordination and precise devastation supporting indirect fire at the point of contact\nMedical personnel who provide a level of assurance to soldiers and returns experienced fighters back to the battlefield\nLogistics personnel who keep a steady supply of fuel, ammo, food and water flowing to everyone\nTechnology personnel who remove some of the confusing fog of war and allow faster decision-making by theater commanders\nIn addition, giving your fighters clear instructions on objectives and rules of engagement reduces civilian casualties.\nTake any of these support elements away, and the tip of the spear becomes much less effective \u2014 maybe inoperable.\nRussia went into Ukraine with almost none of these support elements. According to Brett Friedman, a Marine Corps reserve officer and author of the book On Tactics, \u201cThe simplest explanation here is that the Russian military is bad! It was a paper tiger, and now the paper is on fire.\u201d\nBut make no mistake, Russia is adept at one particular type of warfare: new-generation warfare (NGW) or hybrid warfare. This type of war combines:\nCyberattacks\nMilitary deception (known as \u201cmaskirovka\u201d in Russian)\nDiplomatic threats against European energy markets\nThe assassination of political opponents\nWidespread digital misinformation campaigns\nIn that sense, Russia is not completely outmatched by the West. Indeed, Russia may even surpass NATO in military deception. Hybrid Warfare was conceived by General Valery Gerasimov, Chief of Russian ground forces. It was Gerasimov who could be seen visibly wincing on camera last week when Putin announced upgrading Russia\u2019s nuclear readiness posture.\nU.S. Army Gen. Martin E.

(DoD photo by Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class Daniel Hinton, U.S. Navy/Released)\nPutin\u2019s War in Ukraine Will Have Far-Reaching Consequences for Years to Come\nRussia was a much more threatening country a mere week ago, before we saw how inept the Russian military is at solving routine battlefield problems.\nThe General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine reported that in its first week, Russia lost:\n5,710 personnel\n29 planes\n29 helicopters\n198 tanks\n846 armored fighting vehicles\n77 artillery systems\n305 light armor transports\nIn response to this disaster of his own creation, Putin is now increasing the readiness of his nuclear deterrent, as if to remind the world that the \u201cthreat of annihilation\u201d is much more potent a weapon than actual annihilation.\nIt\u2019s still early in this conflict, but a few things are certain. First, the Russian army appears to be at least three decades behind the West in all areas except the most basic combat maneuver elements. This lack of preparedness means Putin will be unable to stockpile troops on someone\u2019s border (maybe Finland?) under the threat of invasion to get what he wants in the future.\nSecond, it could take several years, perhaps even a decade, for Russia to recover from the devaluation of the ruble and sanctions on its central banks. The average Russian citizen might not realize it yet, but their standard of living is about to plummet for the foreseeable future.\nThis economic disaster will lead to even more domestic unrest and a possible regime change in Moscow. Make no mistake: the sanctions hitting Moscow now are like an economic nuke, compared to the spitballs that we hit Russia with before this conflict.\nThird, America\u2019s other geopolitical rival, China, is watching with interest to see how the West responds to Russia\u2019s military adventurism. Everyone always focuses on America\u2019s large military, but people seldom realize just how much economic power the U.S. has to absolutely collapse a rival\u2019s economy, as is currently happening in Russia.\nThe very fact that China abstained on a United Nations resolution condemning Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, instead of vetoing it along with Russia, likely infuriated Putin and sends a message to the West that China wants no collateral damage from U.S. sanctions currently hitting Russia.\nLastly, with one fateful order, Putin has managed to wipe out all of the progress he made over the past 12 years at trying to fragment the EU and NATO. His brazen aggression has shaken the European continent and led to the creation of a more consolidated and formidable adversary.\nEven Germany, the EU\u2019s sleeping giant, has now pledged to ramp up its defense spending to above 2% of its gross domestic product, something that both Presidents Obama and Trump couldn\u2019t accomplish. Finland and Sweden have now made promising comments about joining NATO. The entire Western world has united against Russia.\nPresident Putin has made a fatal mistake; he believed his own hype and drank his own Kool-Aid. Now, his invasion is producing the exact opposite result from what he intended.\nRight about now, he\u2019s realizing that you can lie to the world about your military capabilities in the interest of projecting power, but it\u2019s foolish to lie to oneself.\n\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0430 \u0443\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0456!\nAbout the Author\nWes O\u2019Donnell is a veteran of the U.S. Army and the U.S. Air Force for a total of 10 years of active-duty service.

What could have possibly scared these two Marlboro men so badly that they would want to hide underground?\nThe 1950s and the Red Scare\nIn the first decade following World War II, Americans had to come to terms with the nuclear genie they unleashed from the bottle.\nOppenheimer may have said it best. Watch him recall witnessing the first atomic blast:\n\nAs images of the flattened cities Hiroshima and Nagasaki began circulating widely, and the radiation threat (fallout) came to be better appreciated, many Americans wondered if they might someday share a similar fate.\nThen, in August of 1949, the Soviet Union detonated their first atomic bomb.\nThere goes the neighborhood\u2026\nWhen the U.S. government realized that America\u2019s atomic bomb plans had been stolen by Russian spies, the \u201cRed Scare\u201d, a nationwide anti-Communist hysteria provoked by a mounting fear that Russia would change the American way of life, began in earnest.\nAccording to Smithsonian Magazine, \u201cthe Federal Civil Defense Administration (FCDA), founded in 1951, set out to convince Americans that if the bomb did drop, they could survive the fallout.\u201d\nThe result was a nationwide boom in the construction of underground, privately-funded fallout shelters located on citizens\u2019 property. If you had money to build one, you and your family were safe. If you were poor, not to worry \u2014 we\u2019ll loan you the money at an exorbitant interest rate.\n1950s diagram of a fallout shelter for four to six people Public domain via Digital Public Library of America\nFor the young WWII combat veterans who had seen the atrocities of war in Europe and Asia firsthand, there was a consensus that it\u2019s better to have something that you don\u2019t need, than to need something that you don\u2019t have.\nEarly in the Cold War, the government concluded that it could not shelter every American citizen from a nuclear war.\nWell, technically they could. They just didn\u2019t want to pay for it.\nInstead, the government created a marketing blitz aimed at the suburbs that included detailed plans on how to build your own bomb shelter.\nThey made DIY cool well before HGTV aired their first Fixer Upper episode. Also, HGTV, if you\u2019re reading, can we get a show with nothing but the reveals? Just one full hour of reveals please.\nThe 500 million FCDA booklets that were sent out across the U.S. showed suburban, white, heterosexual, middle-class families cheerfully lining their bomb shelters with canned goods and blankets in what was arguably the government\u2019s first attempt to normalize nuclear war.\nSuburban families were targeted with government literature because it was presumed that in any nuclear attack, cities would be targeted, and urban dwellers would either be vaporized or flee to the suburbs.\nWhy waste marketing dollars on a customer segment who will be dead soon anyways?\nBut most importantly, this idea that Americans should DIY their own shelters marked a distinct shift from the community shelter model of Europe. Also, making American families responsible for their own survival spoke to the abstract ideal of rugged individualism; an ideal that is deeply rooted in American tradition and history.\nBesides, it was cheaper for the government to shift civil defense responsibility onto the citizens, rather than put that burden on the state.\nAccording to civil defense authorities, a concrete block basement shelter could be built as a do-it-yourself project for $150 to $200 at the time, or about $2,000 today.\nU.S. National Archives and Records Administration/Public domain\nPost-Cuban Missile Crisis\nIn October of 1961, President John F. Kennedy took to the airwaves to encourage American families to build bomb shelters.\nHe even made the crazy promise that the U.S. civil defense program would soon begin providing such protection for every American and then asked Congress for more than $100 million for public fallout shelters.\nMan, JFK was a badass.\nA year later in 1962, Kennedy\u2019s words seemed to be prophetic as the world hovered on the brink of a full-scale nuclear war brought on by the Cuban Missile Crisis.\nThis led many Americans to revisit their DIY projects and ensure that their bomb shelters were well-stocked and started a new wave of bomb shelter construction.\nBut by the late 1960s, after a generation had grown up in the shadow of the bomb, young people began to wonder whether a nuclear war was winnable at all.\nThe friendly depictions of a straight white male, calmly leading his family into the fallout shelter, became the subject of cynicism and ridicule.\nAnd by the 1980s, as global stockpiles of nukes reached an insane 50,000 in number, the public mindset toward bomb shelters got increasingly bleak.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the point of surviving the explosion when all that\u2019s left is a nuclear wasteland? F**k it. Let\u2019s do coke instead.\u201d\nAfter the fall of the Soviet Union, most talk about bomb shelters ended, as did talk about nuclear war itself. Although the threat of a nuclear exchange is higher now than it\u2019s been since the early 1980s.\nThe prepper movement \u2014 Early 2000s\nRemember the Y2K bug that wiped out humanity?\nYeah, me neither.\nBut I do remember the lead up to the year 2000 and how Americans were convinced that all computers everywhere would simultaneously shut down at midnight on New Year\u2019s Day.\nMy squad mate in the U.S. Army infantry at the time was convinced that society would collapse due to Y2K and began stockpiling MREs (Meal Ready to Eat) and automatic weapons all through 1999. I wonder what ever happened to that guy.\nIt didn\u2019t help that cable television (I\u2019m looking at you History Channel) ran nonstop Nostradamus programming that claimed the end of the world was nigh. After all, smut like that consistently got good ratings.\nBut this was my first experience with what would come to be known as prepper culture.\nFor the uninitiated, \u201cpreppers\u201d are individuals who prepare for the collapse of civilization by, ahem, preparing. Ten years in the U.S. military gave me a prepper mindset by default, but I don\u2019t go to the lengths of some preppers who no doubt had a collective orgasm when COVID-19 hit, and got to enact their contingency plans.\n\nI\u2019m not going to call preppers crazy. Hell, they just might be smarter than all of us in light of global pandemics and ongoing climate change.\nBut they are responsible for the revival of the idea of sheltering to survive. In fact, the super-rich can now ride out the apocalypse in style in this survival condo. The annual dues in this HOA must be ridiculous. CNET did an amazing expose of this place.\nThe Survival Condo descends 15 floors and 200 feet underground.\nSurvival Condo & Amy Kim/CNET\nUltimately, I\u2019m of the mindset that instead of being reactive and building bomb shelters, we should be proactively working towards nonproliferation and new arms control treaties that limit the likelihood of these instruments of state from ever being used.\nPutin\u2019s disastrous war of choice in Ukraine has raised the deadly specter of nuclear war into the public conversation again.\nUse this opportunity to support and follow organizations like the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists and the Arms Control Association.\nOr, you could dig up the 1983 classic \u201cThe Day After\u201d, get scared, and then attempt to build a bomb shelter in your backyard.\nThe choice is yours.", "comment_count": 1, "like_count": 12, "created_time": 1651526578522, "comment": [{"user_id": "5f5a6f45b393", "comment_time": 1651526578522, "comment": "Thank you for sharing!"}, {"user_id": "cea404ca44d9", "comment_time": 1651542170054, "comment": "I did some underground utility construction around the Dallas area in the early '80s.

But the story is true.\nAt the height of the Cold War with the Soviet Union pulling ahead in the Space Race, the U.S. Air Force devised a plan to detonate a nuclear bomb on the moon. Officially known as \u201cA Study of Lunar Research Flights or Project A119,\u201d the idea was to trigger a nuclear device on the moon\u2019s surface.\nThe explosion, which would have been visible from Earth with the naked eye, was to be a distinct show of force of the United States\u2019 capabilities. This top-secret plan was developed in 1958, just one year after the Soviet Union\u2019s surprise successful launch of Sputnik 1.\nPhoto by Matt Nelson on Unsplash\nScientist Carl Sagan was recruited for Air Force\u2019s plan to blow up the moon\nOddly enough, the Air Force recruited a young Carl Sagan, then only 24, to handle the mathematics and predictive models for the nuclear explosion.\nA moonstruck Sagan would later become an outspoken voice in the fight against nuclear proliferation. In fact, it was during research for a 1999 biography of Sagan that the project details were uncovered by biographer Keay Davidson.\nThis is the very same biography that ousted Sagan as a long-time cannabis devotee \u2014 except it was the Air Force who was high for thinking this was a good idea.\nCarl Sagan \u2014 Public Domain\nMoon nukin\u2019 called off due to fears of adverse public reaction\nDespite the project\u2019s full revelation in 2000 by team leader Leonard Reiffel and project documents that have now been made public, the U.S. government continues to deny its official involvement in the project.\nIn a horrifying twist, later research from 2010 revealed that the Soviet Union planned its own nuclear strike on the moon, also as a show of force.\nBoth countries ultimately realized that there could, in fact, be an adverse public response to blowing up Earth\u2019s only natural satellite \u2014 to say nothing of what it could do to future space missions. In addition, thanks in part to Sagan\u2019s mathematics, project leaders became increasingly concerned about radioactive fallout on the moon and its challenges to future lunar colonization.\nThose pesky scientists \u2014 always trying to screw up good moon nukin\u2019.\nInstead, the U.S. focused its efforts on landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to Earth. The final blow to the project came with President John F. Kennedy\u2019s Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in 1963, which barred nuclear weapons tests in the atmosphere, underwater, and in space.\nNuclear weapons situation is more complex now\nCertainly, the world is more complex today than it was at the height of the Cold War. For instance, the U.S. and Russia are no longer the only countries with nuclear weapons.\nIn addition, their major bilateral nuclear missile treaty, the Intermediate Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, expired in 2019. There are no plans to renew it.\nThe death of the INF Treaty removes another link in the chain of nuclear escalation. It could potentially result in the reintroduction of hundreds of medium-range nuclear weapons and loony ideas like nuking the moon.\nMoon still unlikely to be destroyed due to international space cooperation\nDespite the INF Treaty being abolished, space has been an arena of cooperation between the U.S. and the Russian Federation since the collapse of the Soviet Union.\nPerhaps cooler heads will prevail the next time a military leader feels like nuking a heavenly body.\nAfter all, what would life on Earth be like without the moon?\nThere would be no tides, no solar or lunar eclipses, and no moonlit nights. Without the moon\u2019s gravitational influence, the Earth\u2019s tilt could vary wildly. Most importantly, Frank Sinatra\u2019s estate would have to change the lyrics of one of his most popular songs to \u201cFly Me to the Debris Field.\u201d\nJust because you can do something, doesn\u2019t mean you should.

Photo by Steve Harvey on Unsplash\nSince Russia and Ukraine are technically at war, Ukraine would be completely justified in attacking the Russian homeland. As of this writing, (and thanks to Russia\u2019s abject failure at achieving air superiority), Ukraine still has an operational Air Force. In fact, they\u2019ve even added 20 more functional aircraft last week thanks to an influx of spare parts from the West.\nStill, as much as some of us would like to see Russia punished for their atrocities in Ukraine, attacking Moscow is a bad idea, even if Ukraine\u2019s fighters could get past Russia\u2019s formidable air defenses.\nHere\u2019s why -\nRussia\u2019s bumbling military, which I\u2019ve been extremely critical of in past writings, is indiscriminately killing soldiers and civilians alike. The images coming out of Ukraine are absolutely heartbreaking.\nRed Army to Dead Army \u2014 How Did the Russians Get so Bad at War?\nFrom the mighty Soviet bear that kept countless NATO generals up at night during the Cold War, to today\u2019s demoralized\u2026wesodonnell.medium.com\nMy old commander in the infantry used to tell me that everyone in war thinks that they are the good guys.\nBut that can\u2019t possibly be true, can it?\nAs an American soldier for six years and an airman for four, I\u2019ve personally witnessed the lengths that the U.S. military goes to in order to avoid civilian casualties \u2014 often putting our own troops in mortal danger to avoid another country\u2019s civilians from getting killed or wounded.\nSure, accidents happen \u2014 what military leaders call \u201ccollateral damage\u201d \u2014 but by and large the United States does not intentionally target civilians, nor do we dig mass graves to hide the innocent bodies.\nI wonder what goes through the Russian soldiers\u2019 minds when they intentionally kill unarmed civilians. Do they actually believe that they are cleansing Ukraine of a Nazi element? Even if they did believe that they can\u2019t use that logic to justify all of the civilian deaths in Ukraine.\nThe truth is that in the real world, there are good guys and there are bad guys. A gross oversimplification maybe, but still the truth.\nIn the Russo-Ukrainian War, Ukraine has the moral high ground. Ukraine is the victim of an unprovoked attack.\nPhoto by Artur Voznenko on Unsplash\nIf we assume that a nation\u2019s destiny should be shaped by its citizens, and if we assume that Ukraine\u2019s citizens have decided to seek closer ties with the West in the aftermath of the 2014 Maidan Revolution, then we should conclude that any attempt to stop the will of the people, especially from an external actor, is not in Ukraine\u2019s best interests.\nWithout venturing too far down the rabbit hole of ideas like sovereignty and democracy, the ultimate question is should Ukraine tarnish its victimhood status for a retaliatory strike against the aggressor?\nThe answer, of course, is no. Despite the temporary morale boost that Ukraine would enjoy and the demoralizing effect it would have on Russia, attacking Moscow would give instant validity to Putin\u2019s pointless war.\nLet\u2019s say some Ukrainian pilot, against all odds, makes it into the Moscow Air Defense District. Moscow\u2019s skies are guarded by five surface-to-air missile regiments armed with S-400 \u2018Triumf\u2019 systems and numerous alert crews ready to scramble fighters at a moment\u2019s notice.

And nobody wants this war to go nuclear.\nRight now, Ukraine enjoys nearly unanimous support from almost every nation on Earth. And while Ukraine would be justified in its attack, it would be overkill.\nZelensky is already embarrassing the Russian military in a modern-day David versus Goliath story.

This would represent the first offensive operation of this war on Russian soil.\nHowever, Ukraine denies that it launched any attack saying \u201cWe are holding defensive military operations on our own territory \u2026 Everything that happens on Russian territory is the responsibility of the Russian leadership. All questions to them.\u201d\nUltimately, could Ukraine successfully attack the Russian capitol?\nProbably not.\nShould they try?\nDefinitely not.\nUkrainians \u2014 Keep fighting the defensive good fight.

You\u2019re surrounded, when all of a sudden, with the tap of a button on your smartphone, the whole city is plummeted into darkness. You\u2019ve just caused a city-wide blackout, and now, you have escaped.\nSounds cool? Well, it is the premise of the hit video game Watch Dogs, released by Ubisoft on May 27, 2014. This open-world action-adventure stealth game was the subject of praise and criticism both before and after its release, but still remains a classic hit, still talked about by gamers today.\nBefore delving into the series as a whole, we must go back to a time when this video game franchise wasn\u2019t even a franchise yet. It is the summer of 2012, and the game is announced at E3. Ubisoft, a well-known and prominent video game developer at this point, known for its blockbuster open-world games such as Assassin\u2019s Creed and Far Cry, has just shown the teaser for their upcoming game about a stealthy hacker attempting to overthrow a society which has become engulfed in technology; in a city where everything is connected, one man is attempting to manipulate the system to his benefit.\nAt the time, the concept seemed revolutionary: technology was rapidly advancing and spreading throughout the world, as it still is, and a major work of media was to address the faults of relying on technology, an important matter. A video game where the player could take this matter into their own hands, hacking anything and everything at their will \u2014 the trailer was a massive success. Ubisoft was praised. All looked well for a potential future video-game series.\nWatch Dogs, scheduled for a fall 2013 release, was eventually delayed until May 2014. When the game was released, however, viewers noticed a difference. According to them, the game appeared to have been downgraded in both gameplay and graphical value from that shown at E3 2012 and 2013. There were less environmental details, and less features for the player, than in the game shown at E3. A huge controversy arose, with Ubisoft denying the allegations. Nonetheless, this was not a good look for the company and the game received heavy criticism for this matter.\nMillions of gamers claimed the game was downgraded, while Ubisoft denied the allegations.\nGraphical downgrades weren\u2019t the game\u2019s only criticism, however. The game was heavily panned by many critics for what they called a \u201cbland\u201d and \u201cdry\u201d plot, including a \u201cdull\u201d and \u201cboring\u201d protagonist, Aiden Pearce. However, this viewpoint wasn\u2019t shared by everyone; in fact, many praised the game\u2019s story and characters, saying that its intense and focused nature allowed the characters to flourish, with Aiden being not boring, but driven: a tough-as-nails vigilante whose no-nonsense nature fares well with his protective nature, as he protects those he loves throughout the story.\nUltimately, Watch Dogs had a riveting plot and characters, and Aiden Pearce is still to this day one of the most iconic characters in modern-day gaming. He is a representation of the divide between technology and safety, as he uses his hacking skills to protect the innocent and punish the guilty. Thus, the claim that the game suffered due to a poor story and characters is merely laughable.\nDespite the heavy criticisms, the game was still a massive financial success, selling over 10 million copies by the end of 2014 and winning Ubisoft the Studio of the Year Award for 2014. At this point, it was clear that Watch Dogs could become a successful series, but only if the sequel was done right. The first game was a financial success, but still garnered impressive criticism. If the sequel followed a similar suit, it would surely be the end of the series.\nFollowing the financial success of the first game, Watch Dogs 2 was released in November 2016.\nAs predicted, Ubisoft eventually revealed that a sequel to Watch Dogs was in the works. In March 2016, they released the teaser trailer, which revealed that Watch Dogs 2 would be set in San Francisco, and star a new protagonist. Learning this news, many gamers who hated Aiden Pearce were glad to see a new protagonist, who would be named Marcus Holloway. Of course, some who liked Aiden Pearce viewed this as a demoralizing change, but still accepted and embraced it. They hoped, however, that Aiden would at least appear in the game at some point (which he ultimately did, in a cameo many viewed as disappointing and unfaithful to the original character. Aiden Pearce, a man who took down an entire criminal underworld by himself, randomly gets captured and imprisoned by a gang in San Francisco? Bruh).\nWatch Dogs 2 was released later that year in November, and once again, reception was mixed. Critics praised the game\u2019s open-world recreation of the San Francisco Bay Area, which faithfully represented a smaller-scale version of the city of San Francisco, along with Oakland, Marin County, and the Silicon Valley region. The improved hacking skills were also praised.\nHowever, like the first game, the plot and characters were heavily panned. Ubisoft took careful consideration to make the characters in Watch Dogs 2 as lively and upbeat as possible, as to not repeat the \u201cdullness\u201d of Aiden Pearce. This backfired, as the characters were extremely underdeveloped and often acted unrealistically, with cringe-worthy dialogue as an attempt to \u201cbe hip\u201d and \u201cwith the times\u201d. The characters \u2014 with the exception of Wrench \u2014 were all underdeveloped, which made them unmemorable. This especially applies to the protagonist, Marcus Holloway, who was simply a puppet who did whatever DedSec told him to do, with no personal connection whatsoever. In contrast, Aiden Pearce had a personal connection, as he was acting to avenge his niece\u2019s death, making his story relatable.\nSimilarly, the story was an unorganized mess; rather than a linear story with specific missions, Watch Dogs 2 relied on an \u201cOperations\u201d system where the main missions contained mini-missions within them. In theory, this is great concept, but it only works when the plot of a game is actually developed enough; in this sense, Watch Dogs 2\u2019s plot was as developed as a fetus, with numerous plot holes and missing elements which, if they existed, would\u2019ve made the overall story that much better. Again, in contrast, the first Watch Dogs had a fully developed plot, and although not perfect, the characters fit in well with it, making it fresh and unique, unlike the second game.\nThe game\u2019s holes were exposed. Many players, who went back and played the first game prior to the release of the second game, later realized how much better the first game really was in comparison to the second game. All of Watch Dogs 2\u2019s failures made the first Watch Dogs\u2019 failures look like strengths. Ultimately, Ubisoft revealed that the game\u2019s pre-orders were \u2018disappointing\u2019, and there was an eighty percent decrease from the sales of the original. At this point, players realized that Watch Dogs 2, although still a great game, paled in comparison to the first one, and the future of the series was looking dreary.\nNonetheless, if a sequel were ever to come, it would most likely be Ubisoft\u2019s last chance to get the game right, or the series might be done for. Would Ubisoft learn from their mistakes, and make Watch Dogs 3 similar to the first one, while ditching most of Watch Dogs 2\u2019s plot and gameplay choices? Or would they continue down the same path, making Watch Dogs 3 a subpar game with an undeveloped plot and characters?\nWatch Dogs Legion, the third game in the series, was announced in 2019.\nFast forward to 2019, three years after the release of Watch Dogs 2, and the third game in the series is announced. It is called Watch Dogs Legion, and stars\u2026 everyone. The game has no central protagonist. Set in a future version of London, where technology rules the streets, the player can take control of anyone their heart desires, with everyone collectively working with DedSec.\nAnnounced at E3 2019, the game received a March 6, 2020 release date. However, a few months later, the game was delayed until late 2020, with its release date being currently unknown as of November 2019. This delay until further notice may reflect a positive change, as delays usually do.\nHowever, it is no surprise that many \u2018traditionalist\u2019 gamers are unhappy with the path Ubisoft is taking the Watch Dogs series in. What was originally an epic tale about a hacker vigilante fighting for justice and avenging his family has turned into an unorganized shitshow, where old grandmothers are running around fighting thugs in pig masks. It arises the question of whether or not the series is heading in the right direction, considering how much it has drifted from its original feel.\nOf course, this question cannot be answered until Watch Dogs Legion is released. As of now, the game appears to be revolutionary in its genre: never has there been an open-world game where the player can play as every citizen (or so Ubisoft claims) that has their own unique story, missions, and gameplay. Never has a modern-day open-world game been set in London, complete with its famous Buckingham Palace, Tower Bridge, and Underground system which the player can ride (although judging by Ubisoft\u2019s history of downgrading games, this is a feature that could ultimately be cut). Surprisingly, in a game with \u2018Dogs\u2019 in the title, the Isle of Dogs is absent (as well as actual dogs, which appeared in Watch Dogs 2 only). Oh, well.\nDespite everything the game claims it will have, and the hype associated with it, this is Ubisoft\u2019s final chance to get a Watch Dogs game right; that is, a Watch Dogs game with a complete plot and developed characters (although in a game where every character has a story, that may not happen). If Legion fails to nail all of these aspects, the Watch Dogs series may be done for good; it will be a mere memory, a primary example of a great concept gone wrong.\nAn ultimate embarrassment for Ubisoft that would be.\nChris is a writer and publisher who travels America, and loves doing it.

Follow him @chriskirsch01 to be informed of new articles.\nPerhaps one of the greatest innovations in human history is the city. Humans are social species, and the concept of living together in a vast, built-up urban environment has never been more relevant than in the ever-urbanizing world we find ourselves living in. But with this increasing urbanization comes opposing forces, and throughout much of the twentieth century, that opposing force was another human invention: the automobile.\nDuring this period, the ever-increasing accessibility and popularity of the automobile, particularly in the United States, threatened to alter the very fabric of the country\u2019s urban landscapes, and numerous concepts of the \u201ccity of the future\u201d arose, putting the automobile front and center. While some of these visions did not quite pan out the way these futurists imagined, some of their ideas did, and with this of course came copious unintended consequences.\nThe history of the automobile itself dates back to at least the nineteenth century, but it was not until the early 1900s that mass production of the automobile began, allowing it to become more accessible to the public and thus more popular. While the automobile was a relatively new invention at this point, its impact had already begun to be felt in cities across America, and feelings regarding this were mixed. According to a 1908 entry from The Yale Law Journal, entitled \u201cThe Status of the Automobile\u201d by H.R. Brown:\n\u201c[Automobiles\u2019] great power, speed and weight have made veritable king of the highway\u2026they have brought suburban towns within easy access from the city; they do not run upon a fixed track, and have no monopoly of any part of the highway; they do not seriously interfere with its use by other vehicles, and afford a most convenient and expeditious method of traveling between cities and outlying villages or country seats.\u201d\nWhile there was no denying their convenience, automobiles were commonly viewed in a negative light, specifically in regards to their impact on the urban environment. During this time, cities consisted of roads which were mere dirt paths, used by horse-and-carriages, electric trolleys, and most importantly, pedestrians. Streets were a place for people to walk, to congregate, to play games \u2014 they were for the people.\nNew York City in the 1900s, a time when pedestrians, not cars, dominated the streets.\nHowever, this livelihood was now being threatened by the newfangled automobile. Because of this, the automobile was not immediately accepted throughout the 1900s and 1910s. The same Yale journal mostly argued against the automobile\u2019s implementation, stating that:\n\u201cThe invention of the automobile has introduced upon the public roads of the country a novel and not altogether welcome guest. The increased size, weight and noise of such cars, particularly those employed in suburban travel, has resulted, as a matter of fact, in a marked depreciation of the value of property upon residence streets.\u201d\nIt is important to note that in this instance \u201chighway\u201d is referring to a street, making the argument that the automobile has forced itself upon the scene and was threatening the very fabric of cities and streets, dragging down land value and pushing people out.\nThe late 1900s and early 1910s were, according to James J. Flink of the American Quarterly, \u201ccharacterized by the rapid development of an attitudinal and institutional context that made the domination of American civilization by the automobile inevitable\u201d which he wrote in his article \u201cThree Stages of American Automobile Consciousness.\u201d It was at this point when the realization settled in that automobiles were not going away anytime soon, and going forward, they would become an integral part of society \u2014 the question was, how were they going to be implemented, and how would our cities adapt to this change?\nIn the early 1910s, the idea began to be seriously considered that our cities would need to adapt and change to make way for the automobile, not the other way around. Numerous concepts of the \u2018future city\u2019 began to be dreamed up which would combine the pedestrian-friendly nature of cities of the time with a less-friendly, automobile-centered nature. The results varied, but most concepts of the time managed to pack in a lot of action in a dense space, serving both the pedestrian and the car rather equally.\nHarvey Wiley Corbett\u2019s \u201cCity of the Future\u201d concept (1913).\nOne of the most prominent concepts of the future city from this time was the City of the Future concept art by Harvey Wiley Corbett, a prominent and reputable architect of the time. Corbett\u2019s vision from 1913 depicts what he envisioned the future city was to look like with the implementation of the automobile, and he imagined a vast urban space with towering skyscrapers, divided into multiple levels. On the bottom level were tunnels for passenger rail and rapid transit subways, then above that lay wide avenues for automobiles to travel, with trolleys running in the middle, and then above the avenue were two more levels of elevated pedestrian walkways which criss-crossed the city.\nCorbett\u2019s vision also featured pedestrian bridges spanning between buildings high above. The result was a complex city serving as the definition of separation: in a world where cities of the time were united by the street \u2014 that is, all forms of transportation shared the same space together \u2014 the city of the future was to be the exact opposite, a space where all forms of transportation had their own reserved spaces, and were completely separated from each other.\nAnother lesser-known but still important concept of the city of the future from the 1910s was Edgar Chambless\u2019s Roadtown. In essence, the Roadtown was a linear city, a \u201cskyscraper [laid] on its side, creating a continuous house and road\u201d according to Robert Mansfield in his book Cosmopolis: Yesterday's Cities of the Future. The Roadtown called for essential services to be held in the \u2018basement\u2019 of the long structure, which would contain roads, and living and working spaces stretching through it.\nEdgar Chambless\u2019s \u201cRoadtown\u201d concept, which would have functioned as one long, indoor city.\nChambless\u2019s Roadtown essentially combined urban, suburban and rural lifestyles all into one. The Roadtown was proposed by Chambless in 1910, and it was a wild plan which ultimately, like much of Corbett\u2019s concept, did not pan out. According to Chambless, the Roadtown would not have just been a concrete jungle, but rather:\nI would surround the city worker with the trees and grass and woods and meadows and the farmer with all the advantages of city life.\nThe automobile\u2019s prominence and popularity increased through the 1920s and 1930s, with this period \u201cinvolv[ing] mass idolization of the motorcar and a mass accommodation to automobility that transformed American institutions and lifeway\u201d, according to James Flink. Concepts of the city of the future with the automobile front and center continued to emerge, including Dr. John A. Hariss\u2019s 1927 idea of a six-deck street in Manhattan, with each level being designated for a different purpose \u2014 for example, the top level \u201cwas reserved for high speed automobile traffic\u201d according to Mansfield, and levels below it were reserved for slower traffic, as well as trucks and buses.\nAdditionally, the highways were to be built with sidewalks, and parking would exist on all six levels. Suffice to say, cities were quickly adapting to the automobile, with the engineering of new road layouts and intersections such as the cloverleaf intersection, and the creation of the Traffic Engineer, a new profession created \u201cin response to the needs of a nation on wheels\u201d according to Volume 35 of The Science News-Letter, published in June 1939.\nThe traffic control engineer\u2019s concern is not with the structure of a road itself. It is with laying out the road so that traffic can move swiftly. It is with traffic signals, road markers and warning signs. He is concerned with intersections -New Jersey\u2019s famous clover-leaf inter- sections on main highways leading out of New York City are typical of the traffic engineer\u2019s work. He is also very much concerned with designing curves such that automobiles can move around them safely at the prevailing speeds on that particular road.\nThe Traffic Engineer played a crucial role in ensuring automobile traffic flowed through suburban and urban areas, and its emergence can be seen as a result of America\u2019s transition to an automobile-dependent nation. But despite these innovations and concepts, however, the transformation of cities was not at the rate which futurists had imagined. That was, until the 1939 World\u2019s Fair, where a new concept of the future city was showcased to the world.\nThe 1939 Futurama exhibit, which depicted the future city as a massive, freeway-oriented space, connected by a complex of pedestrian bridges.\nDubbed Futurama, this exhibit was featured at the World\u2019s Fair in Queens, New York in 1931. It took visitors on a journey, whisking them around a model future city with the primary focus of the exhibit being the vast highways which stretched across and right through the cities. According to Norman Bel Geddes, prominent industrial designer of the time, and creator of the Futurama exhibit:\n\u201cThese motorways which stretch across the model are exact replicas, in small scale, of motorways which may be built in America in the near future.\u201d\nThus, the model was his interpretation of what the future city would look like, putting the automobile front and center. Futurama, like Harvey Wiley Corbett\u2019s \u2018City of the Future\u2019, featured a separated city, one where pedestrians and automobiles were not to live together, but rather, on completely separate levels. In Futurama, expansive freeways criss-crossed cities and urban spaces while pedestrian bridges lingered above.\nThe exhibit was fully sponsored by General Motors, a company whose actions greatly impacted transit in America during this time, and will be touched upon later, and so of course the exhibit placed a strong emphasis on the automobile; however, it was still the most prominent concept of the city of the future, possibly even to this date. It was also arguably the most popular, as \u201cthousands of visitors waited for hours in lines up to a mile in length for the opportunity to experience the Futurama\u201d, according to historian Roland Marchand. The amount of influence Futurama had on the public forced them to believe that this was, indeed, going to be the city of the future \u2014 and in some ways, they were correct.\nHighways were already beginning to be planned and built throughout the early twentieth century, in wake of the automobile, but it was not until the mid-1950s when President Eisenhower sped up the process of organizing a freeway system, and in 1956, the Dwight D. Eisenhower National System of Interstate and Defense Highways, shortened to the Interstate Highway System, opened. For the first time, America actually resembled Futurama, with large arterial highways cutting across major cities and landscapes, severely altering the nature of these cities with negative effects, which will be discussed later.\nA \u2018city of the future\u2019 depicted in Disney\u2019s \u201cMagic Highway, U.S.A.\u201d, which envisioned massive highways a la the Futurama Exhibit, but being used by rocket-powered cars.\nIn 1958, Disney\u2019s Tomorrowland TV series aired an episode called \u201cMagic Highway, U.S.A.\u201d, which depicted America as a nation on the move. Highways were essentially speedways where everyone zipped and zoomed to their destinations in personal transportation devices, of course influenced by the automobile. This illustration was quite ridiculous at times, with concepts such as highways spanning the oceans depicted, but nonetheless its vision in some ways was quite comparable to both the Futurama concept and the actual highway systems which eventually panned out.\nWith many of the primary concepts of the automobile-centered city of the future discussed, it is worth pondering the question: to what extent have these visions come true, and what methods were used to make them a reality? Harkening back to the 1910s concepts of the city of the future, Harvey Wiley Corbett\u2019s vision mostly did not come true. While some of his ideas depicted in the concept, such as the separated levels for subways and roads (subways in tunnels underground, roads with automobiles above) absolutely did come true, his visions of sprawling cities connected by complex series of sky-bridges and pedestrian walkways did not pan out. Rather than pedestrians being separated from automobiles vertically, they were separated horizontally: pushed off the road as Corbett envisioned, but to sidewalks alongside the roads, not on bridges above them.\nChambless\u2019s Roadtown did not take off in full, but his vision was partially realized with the building of the Union Carbide headquarters in Danbury, Connecticut, now known as The Summit at Danbury, where, according to Mansfield, \u201cworkers\u2026can park [their car] within one hundred feet of their office and walk in.\u201d The building consists of large office buildings connected by parking garages and a series of roadways where workers can essentially drive into their workplace, taking inspiration from Chambless\u2019s idea.\nAerial view of the massive Summit at Danbury complex, where workers park their cars right next to their offices inside. The complex is a partial realization of Chambless\u2019s Roadtown concept.\nThe architect of the Union Carbide headquarters, Kevin Roche, stated that his building was \u201cuncontaminated by any kind of formal idea\u2026The design grew entirely out of the initial seed of the office arrangement\u201d which is referring to Chambless\u2019s Roadtown. Even Hariss\u2019s idea of the multi-decked highway came true to an extent, with the city of Chicago featuring multiple-level decked streets in its downtown Loop area, which aid in alleviating traffic and even serve a similar purpose to what Hariss envisioned, with the lower levels intended for express trucks and delivery vehicles, and the upper level devoted to local automobile traffic. What these concepts have in common is that while they were not fully realized, and absolutely did not become widespread, elements of them were in fact realized in certain, very specific instances.\nHarkening back to Futurama, its visions of massive highways cutting through cities, essentially altering the very fabric of America\u2019s urban landscapes to make way for the automobile, did come true, on an even more widespread scale than the visions of the 1910s. This was not coincidental, however, as these highway projects were government-approved and funded. In this instance, America literally shaped its own future \u2014 it wanted a car-centric society, and it got it.\nAround the time of the Futurama exhibit, trolleys and streetcars were the dominant form of transportation, with numerous cities across the country consisting of complex and efficient streetcar systems. Soon after, however, the lines began to be bought over by private corporations, in an event commonly referred to as the General Motors streetcar conspiracy. According to CBS reporter Mark Henricks:\n\u201cBack in the dawn of the Automobile Age, General Motors began systematically buying streetcar lines and then shutting them down, leaving millions of Americans without viable public transportation options. Its motive? To ensure a market for its still-novel personal transportation technology. Rather than walk, the idea was, people would buy [cars].\u201d\nThe true motive for this action is debated among historians: some argue that GM purchased and removed the streetcar lines to replace them with cheaper buses, while some argue that GM did this as part of a plot to remove public transit options for Americans so that they would be forced to purchase and rely on automobiles. Whatever the true motive was, it is undeniable that this action transformed America\u2019s urban landscapes as the streetcars which were a core part of them for decades were removed, and this made way for the massive highways and freeways to be built through them which further altered their landscape.\nScrapped Los Angeles streetcars following the privatization of the lines.\nSoon after the purchasing, privatization and removal of the streetcar lines, America began to build highways across the land, including the Interstate Highway System by President Eisenhower, discussed earlier. It was at this point when America finally began to resemble the \u201ccity of the future\u201d depicted in numerous concepts such as Futurama and even Disney\u2019s \u201cMagic Highway, U.S.A.\u201d, but it was not all a cause for celebration.\nThe construction of these highways forever changed the landscape of many of these cities, and, since many of these cities were already developed, the highways often cut right through already-existing neighborhoods, completely demolishing and destroying neighborhoods \u2014 which were often poorer and home to helpless minority residents. For example, multiple neighborhoods were completely destroyed in 1955 due to the construction of the Cross Bronx Expressway in The Bronx, New York.\nAt the helm was Robert Moses, the man whose job was to fulfill America\u2019s automobile-centered vision in New York City, and he did this through the construction of numerous highways and freeways in and around the city, such as the Belt Parkway and the aforementioned Cross Bronx Expressway. Author and philosopher Marshall Berman, who lived in The Bronx during the construction of the Cross Bronx Expressway, literally had his home and neighborhood destroyed due to this project, as discussed extensively in his 1982 book All That Is Solid Melts Into Air, specifically in the chapter \u2018Robert Moses: The Expressway World\u2019, and the subject of a previous article of mine.\nThis devastation occurred in cities across the country, not just New York, where the citizens who lived in these areas \u2014 again, often minority groups \u2014 had their livelihoods destroyed by the construction of these automobile havens, and the fulfillment of this \u201cdream\u201d of the future city. This was, in essence, America\u2019s vision of an ideal city: one reliant on automobiles, not mass transit.\nSan Francisco waterway before and after the Embarcadero Freeway\u2019s removal.\nWhile this vision was mostly achieved, it was not long before ideals began to shift, and after a few decades, no longer was an automobile-centric city and society viewed as desirable. The damage was done, however, as the freeways and interstates built in the mid-twentieth century were already completed and implemented, and the neighborhoods they ran through were already destroyed and segregated.\nDecades later, the ideal \u201cfuture\u201d city was no longer one that relied on automobiles, but one that saw a return to a reliance on public transit and pedestrian-friendly spaces, as cities once were before the automobile. Some American cities, such as San Francisco and Seattle, have taken part in this process, with San Francisco\u2019s removal of the Embarcadero Freeway in 1991, and Seattle\u2019s removal of the Alaskan Way Viaduct in 2019.\nBoston\u2019s Central Artery/Tunnel Project or \u201cBig Dig\u201d, a megaproject which demolished the elevated Central Artery which cut right through downtown, and replaced it with an underground tunnel and built fresh green space above it, lasted for sixteen years. When it was finally completed in 2007 to the tune of $8 billion ($21 billion adjusted for inflation), it was easily the most expensive highway project in American history.\nDespite this, it can be argued that the Big Dig, along with the removal of the other highways in San Francisco and Seattle, were beneficial to the cities which they affected, as they replaced these clunky, bulky elevated highways with more valuable space, and lowered their overall reliance on the automobile.\nDowntown Boston before and after the \u2018Big Dig\u2019.\nUltimately, the concepts of the \u201ccity of the future\u201d from the early- and mid-twentieth centuries contained a plethora of unique concepts, but were united by one common factor: the automobile. They viewed the automobile as the answer, the solution to America\u2019s problems specifically within cities, and elements of these visions were carried out in some aspects. Yet, their implementation did not come without drastic unintended consequences, both environmentally and culturally.\nThrough these consequences, it has become increasingly clear that the city of the future is no longer one which relies on automobiles, but rather does the opposite. In a matter of less than a century, America went from believing that the ideal city was one relying on the automobile, to realizing that the opposite is, in fact, true.\nWhen analyzing past visions of the future city, two aspects become apparent: what the ideal city was once considered to be, and how quickly those ideals can shift. While automobiles should not be cut completely, as they are undeniably vital to navigating around a country built for the car, they should, for the most part, take a back seat in major cities.\nChris is a writer and publisher who travels America, and loves doing it.

Not a good look.\nAs a cool, 74-degree day loomed over Jupiter, Florida, a clearly-frustrated but seemingly uncaring Rob Manfred took to the stage in front of reporters.\n\u201cThe calendar dictates that we are not going to be able to play the first two series of the regular season,\u201d he addressed the reporters, the media, and the millions of watching fans. \u201cThose games are officially canceled.\u201d\nBeing completely numb to the situation, Manfred smiled and laughed on stage \u2014 but coming from a Commissioner who called the World Series trophy \u2018a piece of metal\u2019, this is hardly a surprise. The cancellation of 91 games appeared to be the culmination of the acrimony built up between the two parties: the players and the owners.\nIn this situation, a sticky, convoluted mess of disagreements between the team owners and players ensued, a mess whose anticipation was only ticking down as the calendar lingered toward December 2, 2021. On that date, at exactly 12:00 a.m. Eastern, Major League Baseball, as represented by the thirty team owners (who are represented by Rob Manfred, the Commissioner) locked out the players.\nWhat ensued was over two months of naught. What could have been a period of time where progress was made turned into a period of time that was wasted. The owners rejected talks of negotiations and put the situation off until after the holidays. Following that period, the two sides would meet for about fifteen minutes every few days, with virtually zero progress being made. Putting it off until it was too late, they finally began to negotiate within the last ten days, but by then, it was too late.\n\nThis entire situation is, of course, on both sides. Both the Players Association and the owners, who again, are represented by Manfred, have continuously failed to reach an agreement, and in turn, have continuously failed to please the consumer: the fan.\nThe sport is, in essence, shooting itself in the foot. In a statement responding to the Commissioner\u2019s decision to cancel games, the MLBPA said:\n\u201cRob Manfred and MLB\u2019s owners have cancelled the start of the season. Players and fans around the world who love baseball are disgusted, but sadly not surprised. From the beginning of these negotiations, Players\u2019 objectives have been consistent \u2014 to promote competition, provide fair compensation for young Players, and to uphold the integrity of our market system. Against the backdrop of growing revenues and record profits, we are seeking nothing more than a fair agreement.\u201d\nLet\u2019s not make it out to appear as if one side is to blame for this situation. Perhaps, is one side more to blame than the other? Maybe. But at the end of the day, it is on both parties to come to an agreement, but with the players\u2019 bar being set so high, and the owners\u2019 greed standing in the way, the situation is as fitting as a train whose wheels are too large or small to fit on the rail. In other words, it\u2019s an impasse.\nAfter nearly seventeen hours of negotiating, Manfred and the owners sent the Players Association a so-called \u201cfinal offer\u201d, which proposed that the minimum player salary be increased from $675,000 to $700,000, and the implementation of a 12-team postseason, as well as a slight $5 million increase for the pre-arbitration bonus pool, but no increase for the CBT thresholds. The MLBPA rejected this offer, leading to Manfred officially delaying the season.\nManfred, notably, has the power to lift the lockout immediately, but will not do so as the players could then strike, similar to what occurred in 1994. Fans will recall that season, which saw the cancellation of 948 games and the entire 1994 World Series. And now, twenty-eight years later, the sport has engaged in its eighth-ever work stoppage, and the fifth to cost games \u2014 so far, 91 games have already been canceled, not even including the entire Spring Training season, and further cancellations are bound to come.\n\nAs of this point, the first two series of the 2022 regular season have been canceled, and, according to the Commissioner, will not be made up. All games lost will also result in a loss in pay for the players, something the MLBPA has contested. In a statement, union chief negotiator Bruce Meyer said:\n\u201cTo say they won\u2019t reschedule games if games are canceled or they won\u2019t pay players for those games that are canceled is solely their position. They\u2019re not legally required to take those positions\u2026We would have a different position.\u201d\nAs the lockout enters its 91st day, currently coinciding with the number of regular-season games already lost (as mentioned, this will almost definitely increase, barring a miracle agreement being reached within the week), it confirms that the 2022 season will, for the third consecutive time, be an anomaly. The 2020 season was shortened to 60 games due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the 2021 season was ravaged with COVID restrictions, outbreaks and venue capacity limits.\nAnd now, in 2022, the season will once again be shortened. It is unlikely that the season will be outright canceled, but if an agreement is not reached as the days and weeks pass, more and more games will continue to be canceled. Now, the earliest date that Opening Day can commence is April 7, and even that date appears to be in jeopardy.\nClamors over fed-up fans turning their backs on the sport, quitting watching games due to frustration, have arisen during these trying times for baseball. For the older fan, these claims are hardly warranted, for baseball, despite its current rut, will recover. But the younger fan, a member of the demographic MLB has been striving to win over in recent decades, but is arguably faltering in this regard, may not be so forgiving. Howard Bryant, senior writer for ESPN, put this dilemma well, stating:\nWhen the games eventually return, the power of the sport will overcome the people who run it. Fans will get caught up in the taut pennant races and all the wondrous talents on the field, for the players are the game. But every day of this lockout has exposed a loss. The last several months have reinforced a certain ugliness to the sport. It won\u2019t kill baseball \u2014 because the players always save it \u2014 but it has made it a little less attractive, watching it a little less given.\nWhile the 2022 lockout may be a horrendous look for MLB and the sport of baseball \u2014 and this includes both the players and owners, and especially Rob Manfred \u2014 it will recover. With other sports rising in popularity, though, baseball certainly has a plethora of work to accomplish in order to retain its position as one of America\u2019s dominant sports, especially as the interest of the younger demographic wanes.\nBaseball has arguably already already lost its title of America\u2019s Game, and what comes next in the sport\u2019s legacy will have to be decided by both the players and owners. May the baseball gods bless the sport with all their might.\nChris is a writer and publisher who travels America, and loves doing it.

Follow him @chriskirsch01 to be informed of new articles.\nIn the current day and age, it is essentially morally impossible to ignore the tragic and inhumane history which encapsulated the founding and establishment of the United States of America. Specifically, the mistreatment of both the native inhabitants of the lands which Europeans claimed, and those forced into slavery, are aspects of this nation\u2019s history which simply cannot be swept under the rug.\nBoth the historical text Common Sense by Thomas Paine and the literary text Ten Hills Farm by Catherine S. Manegold acknowledge the mistreatment of these peoples and argue that the actions of the settlers were intentionally meant to harm them without any repercussions or possible compromises.\nIn 1776, Thomas Paine published a pamphlet entitled Common Sense, in which he advocated for the American Colonies\u2019 independence from Britain. To Paine, it was only common sense, as the title implies, that the Colonies would break away from the British reign.\nAlthough not a primary focal point of the historical text, Paine does touch upon both slavery and the mistreatment of Native Americans which, upon first glance, may resemble an undermining of their existence, but in reality is an argument in support of them and against Britain. Regarding this, he writes,\n\u201cThere are thousands and tens of thousands, who would think it glorious to expel from the Continent, that barbarous and hellish power, which hath stirred up the Indians and the N*****s to destroy us.\u201d\nThis can be interpreted in a number of ways. At first glance, it appears that he is implying that the Native Americans (which he labels \u2018Indians\u2019) and African-Americans (which he labels \u2018N*****s\u2019) are planning to revolt and destroy \u2018us\u2019, the white settlers and slave owners. However, upon further examination it can be inferred that Paine is merely acknowledging the cruel treatment of the Native Americans and African-Americans in the Colonies, and is using this as another argument for the Colonies\u2019 separation of Britain.\nHe states that thousands of Colonists would agree to expel British rule from the Colonies because the British intentionally treated the Native Americans and African-Americans harshly using their \u201cbarbarous and hellish\u201d power, and thus are responsible for both the implementation of slavery in the Americas and the mistreatment of Native Americans and their lands in North America.\nPaine then references the abuse of Native Americans in America when he states that, \u201che who hunts the woods for prey, the naked and untutored Indian, is less Savage than the King of Britain\u201d. Once again, at first glance, it may appear that he is undermining the Native American by stating that those who hunt and kill Native Americans are less barbaric than the British Crown, as if Native Americans are not important, but in reality he is arguing the opposite.\nThe 1619 Project is an example of an initiative which aims to further educate those about slavery.\nPaine is criticizing the British Crown for the hunting and killing of the Native Americans, and the forceful removal of the Native Americans from their very own land, essentially arguing that nobody is less barbarous than the British due to these malicious actions. He also mentions that in a few years\u2019 time, \u201cwe, or those who may succeed us, would be as ignorant of martial matters as the ancient Indians\u201d, implying that the Native Americans were unaware that the British were to engage them in war for their land, and as such were ill-prepared and defeated. Thus, Britain was morally incorrect for invading the Native Americans\u2019 land and conquering them, and due to this (and other reasons), it was only morally right for the Colonists to secede.\nWhile Common Sense acknowledges the horrors that Native Americans and African-Americans were forced to endure during the time of its writing and publication, the literary text Ten Hills Farm by Catherine S. Manegold completely submerges the reader into the perspective of the victims.\nWhile its primary focus is on the treatment and torture of slaves at Ten Hills Farm, a large estate which was located in the Massachusetts Bay Colony, the book also outlines the origins of the British settling in what would become the Colonies, discussing the horrible acts of violence and deception that they bestowed upon the Native peoples who already called the so-called \u201cnew\u201d world home. In Ten Hills Farm, Manegold tells of an extremely powerful and cold-hearted conquest of the Native Americans by the British settlers, writing,\n\u201cThen came fishermen, laborers, ministers, and warriors\u2026Almost imperceptibly, a complex history was casually erased, as though the god of memory had simply closed his eyes.\u201d\nManegold argues that the settlers had no remorse for the Natives\u2019 existence and the very land they called home \u201cfor a millennium\u201d, as she puts it. Ten Hills Farm makes it abundantly clear that the settlers intentionally destroyed the lives of the Natives to suit their own selfish desires.\nOne of these settlers was John Winthrop, an Englishman who played a prominent role in establishing the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Despite claiming to be a religious man and leading the Puritans to Massachusetts such that they could establish a new religious land, Winthrop spoke of the Natives as if they were mere dirt, with Manegold stating that,\n\u201c[According to Winthrop], God had already \u201cconsumed the natives with a miraculous plague\u201d\u2026At Ten Hills Farm he took his own.\u201d\nWinthrop was one of the cold-hearted settlers who intentionally contributed to destroying the Natives\u2019 lives so he could settle land which was viewed as \u201cnew\u201d, but rather was already claimed by Natives. Then, he made matters worse by settling and establishing Ten Hills Farm, becoming the owner of numerous helpless slaves. Winthrop had no interest in compromise with the natives and did not fear repercussions from stealing their land or owning and abusing slaves. In this lens, Winthrop can be viewed as one of the numerous \u201cbarbarous\u201d settlers that Paine was referring to in Common Sense.\nDuring this time, oppression was, sadly, a way of life throughout the world, and America adopted it.\nTen Hills Farm is a brutally blunt literary text, but it is this very nature which makes it extremely moving. Manegold does not hold back on portraying life as it was for the helpless Native Americans and African-Americans, admitting that this time period consisted of a \u201cculture that\u2026[was] notorious for the sadistic abuse of workers, [and] \u201cmen\u201d meant either indentured servants or, more often, African and Indian slaves.\u201d\nThe abuse of these ethnic groups openly ran rampant during this era, with \u2018men\u2019 referring to minorities whom rich white settlers could force to work for them, with severe and sometimes fatal repercussions occurring if they refused. Ten Hills Farm analyzes this for both Native Americans and African-American slaves but places more of an emphasis on the slavery side, outlining the absolutely brutal conditions that slaves would have to endure, both physical and mental torture.\nThe slaves at Ten Hills Farm had no freedom whatsoever and faced brutal punishments, often for no reason, as \u201calmost any infraction called for a slave to be whipped, disfigured, killed by public hanging, burnt to death, or broken on the wheel\u201d, according to Manegold. These punishments, as well as the ruling entities of the Ten Hills Farm estate and all other slave owners in the Colonies and early America, were carried out by white men who acted without remorse and feared no repercussions, as there were none for them.\nThrough interpretation and understanding of the foul actions committed against both Native Americans and African-Americans during the colonial time period, which are acknowledged in Thomas Paine\u2019s Common Sense and outlined vividly in Catherine S. Manegold\u2019s Ten Hills Farm, a picture can be drawn in regards to how truly rooted in sin the establishment and development of the United States is.\nKnowingly brought about by the European settlers, the physical and cultural destruction caused by them cannot even be fathomed. The actions of the perpetrators against these ethnic groups were all, of course, intentional, and so the question of whether or not the settlers acted in this manner without fear of any repercussions and without the acceptance of any possible compromises, which is argued by both the historical text Common Sense and the literary text Ten Hills Farm, becomes shockingly clear: absolutely.\nChris is a writer and publisher who travels America, and loves doing it.

I didn\u2019t love it. I didn\u2019t hate it. Sometimes I liked it. Sometimes I didn\u2019t like it. I\u2019ve had worse jobs \u2014 at Walmart, I was paid a lot less for a more difficult job as a booster team stocker. At Walmart, it was always a puzzle to find out where an item went on the shelves. At Amazon, a computer tells you where something goes. There\u2019s no guessing. Most of the time, however, it was both boring and extremely isolating, since it\u2019s just you at your station 90% of the time.\nI was hired at Amazon very quickly and conveniently. I am a teacher, and when I didn\u2019t get hired to work at summer school I was bummed \u2014 and I knew that I had to find some work, and very quickly.\nAt Amazon, my job was as a picker. There are also stowers, packers, tote runners, counters, people who organize totes at downstack (where totes are prepared for the station), people who repair malfunctioning Kiva robots, and people who take items off the floor. There are janitors, security guards, and social distance enforcers. The managers I\u2019ve worked with had all treated me very kindly, save the couple of times I was caught using my phone while picking, but that was polite reprimanding that I deserved.\nThe Ruthless Tactics Keeping Amazon on Top\nonezero.medium.com\nI don\u2019t know if this is the kind of job I could have handled for the long term. I\u2019m lucky I only worked there this summer, and my more experienced co-workers showed me the ropes whenever I was having trouble. I had to switch out my shoes after about two days of work \u2014 my feet were killing me. I was more tired and was not able to keep up running as much as I\u2019m used to.\nThere is no one universal experience in the warehouse. It\u2019s kind of like the military \u2014 there are a lot of different responsibilities you can have. The facility is absolutely huge and easy to get lost in. There are two metrics that Amazon uses to evaluate a warehouse picker: units per hour and takt time (the amount of time it takes you to process one item). Luckily, I had learning ambassadors, experienced employees who teach you the job, who taught me how to pick fast. But the only time I really interacted with managers was if my rate was too slow and they needed to tell me to speed up. The goal was to pick 350 units per hour and have a takt time of seven seconds.\nAt first, I really struggled with my rate. I was picking about 250 units per hour, and saw it as flat-out impossible to get a takt time of 11 seconds on a good shift. Someone came to talk to me about my rate and examined my picking to see why I was going so slow. She showed me a couple of tricks to pick faster and said that there were no repercussions because I was new, but that management was going to start writing up people who were working too slow.\nI guess something just clicked one day during my third week of work, where I picked about 400 units per hour and had a takt time of around eight seconds. I still don\u2019t totally understand how some people pick so fast, but like any job, you get better at it over time.\nThe fact that these pods malfunction so regularly makes me optimistic that these warehouse jobs aren\u2019t going to be automated any time soon.\nOn many shifts, I would get messages on the computer at my station, some that ranked my performance amidst my co-worker pickers. At first, my performance was horrible. I was consistently in the 20th to 30th percentile of pickers. I would also get messages that my takt time was too slow. Fortunately, I got better and ended the job consistently in the 80th percentile of pickers on my floor. I know this might sound brutal to some, but for me it was easy to just not pay too much attention to it. I saw it as nothing more than a message on the computer. Experience made me better at the job, but I also couldn\u2019t help but feel like ranking the productivity of your workers was a little problematic.\nDespite the fact that I was considered \u201cexperienced\u201d just four weeks into the job, a big item that was both heavy and the size of the entire bin would still kill my takt rate, as did any missing items. Sometimes, an object fell onto the floor and the Kiva pods (self-driving car robots that carry big bins) stop moving. We create tickets on the computer called \u201candons\u201d which is just a fancy technical term for reporting technical difficulties. The fact that these pods malfunctioned so regularly made me optimistic that these warehouse jobs aren\u2019t going to be automated any time soon. However, I did wish a malfunctioning pod or missing item didn\u2019t reflect so poorly on your rate, which is the ultimate determination of your performance. And most of the time, there\u2019s simply nothing you can do about either.\nThere\u2019s a rumor I hear about Amazon warehouses that management doesn\u2019t let you go to the bathroom. I got two 30-minute breaks, but that might differ from warehouse to warehouse. No manager was going to penalize me if I went to the bathroom when I wasn\u2019t on one of my 30-minute breaks, as long as I was able to keep up my rate.\nI\u2019ve always tried to make sure I was doing well enough and working fast enough before I took a bathroom break, so there\u2019s certainly a lot of productivity pressure imposed to not go to the bathroom unless you\u2019re in a place where you can sacrifice part of the speed of your rate.\nI\u2019ve only worked at an Amazon warehouse during the coronavirus pandemic, so I don\u2019t know what they\u2019ve changed exactly from pre-Covid times. I think Amazon handled it as best as they could. There is no shortage whatsoever of cleaning supplies. You didn\u2019t have to go far at all to find disinfecting spray and hand sanitizer, which were placed at every station, every break table, and at all the water dispensers.\nOn one day, we had to carry around social distance trackers that beeped when we were within six feet of another person. That was just one day, though, so it seems like they were just beta-testing the trackers. However, there were employees designated in hot spots like break rooms who strictly enforced social distancing. I don\u2019t envy the job of trying to police human behavior, but they did a very good job and were firm in making sure everyone is six feet apart in those hot spots. Masks were required, but I didn\u2019t see any enforcement and I can tell you that it\u2019s not easy to keep a mask on for that many hours of physically demanding work. Plus, during breaks, you had to take off your mask to eat. If you didn\u2019t have a mask coming in, they provided you with a disposable mask.\nAmazon Isn\u2019t Even That Convenient Anymore\nHave we reached peak Amazon frustration?onezero.medium.com\nAfter you enter through the Amazon gates, there are monitors that checked your distance to someone else. If you were flashing red on the monitor, you were too close to someone else. If you were flashing green, you were good. After you enter, there are temperature checks. If there\u2019s anything wrong or abnormal, there are employees at the entrance who will double-check your temperature. If your temperature is over 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit, you are sent home, and I can only hope that workers who have been sent home are paid normally, but according to Business Insider, some employees say that they aren\u2019t being completely paid for time off.\nThe only thing I think Amazon can do better in terms of social distancing is the entrance. I have never seen as big of a crowd in the warehouse as at 6 p.m. every single day, at the end of my shifts, where hundreds of people were in a hurry to get home as soon as possible, while other hundreds of people were rushing through the doors from the other direction to clock in on time.\nTo be clear, I\u2019m trying to get home as fast as possible too, and the parking lot at that time is a big logjam. I had been stuck in the Amazon parking lot for 30 minutes before I was able to begin my commute home. Other workers were running as fast as they could to make the bus.\nThe fact that one big wave of shifts was ending and another big wave of shifts was starting is probably the biggest reason why crowding happens at the entrance. A temporary solution would be to simply better stagger shift times.\nI never hated the job as much as the time I was asked to be in charge of taking the totes off of the manual pick and stow stations. Sometimes, there are too many pickers and everyone doesn\u2019t get assigned a station. Some pickers are left on \u201cstandby,\u201d which means they have free time until they\u2019re assigned to a station. I\u2019m not going to lie, but I really didn\u2019t mind being on standby.\nThere are automated pick stations at Amazon where pickers\u2019 totes automatically go into the conveyor and to the packers, and then there are manual stations for pickers and stowers, where we were required to bring full, heavy totes to the conveyors.\nI did this one day, and I was the only person on my floor loading and pushing full flatbed carts of extremely heavy totes to the conveyor. Every time I unloaded over 60 full totes on the conveyor, I would go back to the manual stations and see more full totes piled up \u2014 it was like a never-ending Sisyphean toil. Another person probably would have helped, but that\u2019s the job I never wanted to work in the warehouse again.\nIt made me realize how privileged I was, to both have been a seasonal employee and to have had one of the easier jobs in the warehouse on most days.\nI didn\u2019t love this job, but my experience wasn\u2019t nearly as bad as some of the horror stories I\u2019ve read in the media. But what most people don\u2019t know is the isolation of the job in the first place. I had whole days where I didn\u2019t talk to anyone (unless there was a problem). I wish there was more social interaction as a picker, but considering the pandemic, maybe it\u2019s good that there isn\u2019t. Still, the isolating nature of the job is a benefit to Amazon since it\u2019s part of what makes it so difficult for warehouse workers to organize.\nAll my interactions with other workers had been extremely cordial. My managers were very friendly, helpful, and understanding. I feel like most people genuinely wanted to support me and help me succeed. And while I\u2019m sure that varies from fulfillment center to fulfillment center and manager to manager, I\u2019ve really enjoyed interacting with all the people at my warehouse. They share similar concerns about making ends meet as well as similar complaints about malfunctioning robots or demanding performance rates.\nAmazon has its issues with forcing its workers to be more productive, but an untold villain that people don\u2019t want to hear about is the customer. The customer wants convenience, with free shipping and packages sent within a two-day time period.\nWhat people don\u2019t like to think about is that convenience has a human price. After working at Amazon, I realize the biggest difference I can make toward better treatment for workers is to stop shopping there.\nNot shopping at Amazon seems like a doomsday proposal to me \u2014 which just goes to show how Amazon, as a company, has taken a larger-than-life presence in our digital marketplace. Covid-19 has certainly exacerbated that and raised the demand for e-commerce.\nPutting pressure on the company to give better pay, provide better benefits, accept unionization, and establish less demanding working conditions comes by hurting Amazon fiscally. If enough people stop shopping at Amazon, the company might react by laying off employees in response to lower demands. But if Amazon is hurt fiscally, it might have no other choice but to give in to public demand, like any big international corporation.\nWe have decried working conditions for Amazon workers, and those complaints are valid \u2014 however, what we often fail to realize is that part of the reason Amazon has succeeded is because customers are addicted to convenience. But that convenience comes at a price for warehouse workers. I wish that I would have been more patient when an Amazon package didn\u2019t arrive on a given day, now that I know what goes into getting that package to me.\nAmazon wants to please the customer by whatever means necessary. That philosophy is what helped make it the biggest company in the world. It\u2019s on us, as consumers, to change that.", "comment_count": 16, "like_count": 2811, "created_time": 1595437029264, "comment": [{"user_id": "63463afc4a3f", "comment_time": 1595437029264, "comment": "Thank you for sharing!"}, {"user_id": "9c76bed816f1", "comment_time": 1597905261293, "comment": "I started working at Amazon just after Prime Week, 2017.

It\u2019s revealed a lot about myself and about the psyche of the country as a whole.\nOn one October morning, my friend and I went on a run. It was a very routine run in Baltimore with a very routine route. We stopped at a stoplight, and a very big dude waiting at a bus stop stood up, came up to me, and asked \u201cdo you want to run up on me?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I responded.\n\u201cDo you want to run up on me?\u201d He asked in a more heated tone.\nI thought he noticed we were runners and wanted to race across the sidewalk, or something like that. But he kept asking \u201cdo you want to run up on me?\u201d numerous times, and I simply didn\u2019t know how to respond. He was a much bigger man, and my friend urged me to just cross the street once we were allowed to cross and we went about the day.\nI\u2019m Asian, and the man was Black.\nI took great care to override any racial biases I might have. I did not want to think of a big Black man, who weighed as much if not more than me and my friend combined, who kept saying \u201cdo you to run up on me?\u201d repeatedly as threatening, but at the same time, I didn\u2019t really know what he was asking. My friend, who\u2019s a white guy, was a lot more direct and didn\u2019t engage in as much of the mental gymnastics.\nThe last thing I wanted to seem, at the moment, was racist.\nHowever, my friend made it clear the man clearly wanted to fight, from his proposition as well as his body language. It was way too early in the morning to get in a fight, he joked. But my interpretation was clearly wrong \u2014 to \u201crun up\u201d on someone meant you wanted to throw hands, my friend told me. In the future, I would be wise to rely on my street-smart instincts and just not engage.\nAbout 30 minutes later, we ran back to the block where this happened, and my friend said we should be on the other side of the street. We ran past and the man was still there. A female jogger ran past, and he said something to her, and she didn\u2019t reciprocate. We couldn\u2019t hear what was said, but she didn\u2019t acknowledge him. I\u2019ve been told this on numerous occasions by both white and Black friends: the best thing you could do in that situation is to not make any eye contact, don\u2019t say anything, keep your head down, remove yourself from the situation, and go about your day.\nI do not know anything about this man, and I don\u2019t want to make any assumptions. We can\u2019t assume he was catcalling the jogger or that he actually wanted to fight. But to us, it seemed like he struggled with his mental health and may have been homeless.\nI didn\u2019t think much of my race at the moment, but I did think about the man\u2019s race. Why was I engaging in so much mental gymnastics to just not seem racist at the moment? I am well aware that I have implicit biases and need to work on them, especially as a teacher in predominantly Black and high-poverty inner-city schools for the past three years.\nBut do I have to engage in the work to the point of completely disregarding my common sense, my instinct for personal safety, or more? I do see the counterpoint: my instinct could be racist. But this is not a world that\u2019s going to reward introspection and reflectiveness when someone\u2019s repeatedly asking \u201cdo you want to run up on me?\u201d\nI thought about the man\u2019s race a lot, and whether I was being racist, or whether my fear of being racist was leading me to behave naively and stupidly in that situation. It was a moral conflict I struggled with for a while because I do spend a lot of time in activist and woke spaces. My moral conflict wasn\u2019t going to save me if there was an altercation we clearly weren\u2019t going to win.\nHowever, as I grew more educated about anti-Asian hate crimes around the country and the senseless murders of Asian women and elders.\nIn March 2022, a 67-year-old Filipino woman in Yonkers was stomped on and punched over 125 times after being called an \u201cAsian bitch.\u201d The suspect suffered from mental illness and previously served sentences for stabbing and pushing a woman through a window.\nIn March 2021, a Filipino woman was pushed to the ground, kicked in the face, and called a racial slur by a homeless man on parole for murdering his own mother. In the Bay Area, 84-year-old Thai immigrant, Vicha Ratanapakdee, was killed after being pushed to the ground in the Bay Area. In February of this year, 35-year-old Asian-American, Christina Yuna Lee was stabbed 40 times and found dead in her bathtub by a homeless man who followed her into her apartment and killed her.\nMost notoriously, six Asian women were killed by a white man who said he struggled with a \u201csex addiction\u201d and wanted to eliminate \u201ctemptation.\u201d\nAs an Asian-American, I actually think these high-profile attacks are not racially motivated, or at least are not motivated by racial animus against Asian Americans (legally speaking). It is hard to prove these attacks are hate crimes.\nHowever, that does not mean I don\u2019t think there is a racial element to it, and one that might even be more pernicious than whether these attacks or labeled hate crimes or not.\nThe fact is many of these attacks seem to be more motivated by the mental state of perpetrators than race. Many of these attacks are done by homeless people. And I am one of the last people who will advocate for more policing as a solution to these senseless attacks.\nThe question then remains: why are so many homeless and mentally ill people targeting Asians? Why are Asians disproportionately the victims of these attacks? Are Asians easy targets? In particular, are Asian elders and Asian women easy targets?\nWhat does it say about the role of Asians in America if even some of the most vulnerable members of society, the homeless and mentally ill, view Asians as dispensable easy targets?\nAs an Asian man, I struggle with this question. I recently grew out a beard \u2014 not out of a desire to grow out facial hair, necessarily, but because I didn\u2019t shave while my fiancee had COVID. It looked good, so I kept growing it out. My students comment I look like the \u201cAsian Wolverine.\u201d I do notice students respect my authority more in a variety of ways.\nAll of this is to say that in terms of personal safety, I am significantly more privileged than an Asian woman or an Asian elder in the community. And it\u2019s important to acknowledge that. In particular, there are a lot of stereotypes about Asian women as meek and submissive that do a horrible disservice at any time but particularly in this present moment.\nI am not an Asian woman, but my mother, grandmother, and my cousins are. My parents are getting older. I have a lot of friends who are Asian women who fear for their safety as more news of attacks unravels.\nOf course, confronting homelessness and mental illness are pivotal challenges for American society, and confronting anti-Asian attacks is also essential.\nThere has been a lot of talk in woke circles about the awkward place Asians occupy. Asians can sometimes be perceived as the \u201cmodel minority\u201d and \u201cwhite-adjacent,\u201d essentially allies to white supremacy. I\u2019ve even thought about whether there\u2019s such a thing as \u201cAsian privilege\u201d because your average Asian has much less to fear in an encounter with law enforcement than your average Black American.\nAsian solidarity is extremely flimsy, especially compared to Black solidarity. \u201cAsian\u201d is such an umbrella term to define very diverse groups of ethnicities. The immigrant generation may harbor significant division between different Japanese and Chinese people, for example, but first, second, and third-generation Asians are growing significantly more solidarity.\nWhat these attacks show is Asians are vulnerable to being \u201ceasy targets,\u201d are vulnerable to being seen as dispensable, and sometimes, a lot of times, Asian lives don\u2019t matter.\nIf an Asian elder can be stomped on and kicked, without anyone intervening, what message does that send about the value of Asian lives? If a killer can justify killing six Asian women on his \u201csex addiction\u201d and need to eliminate \u201ctemptation,\u201d what value does that send about the value of Asian lives?\nWhere is the outcry?

In fact, it was most of my life, from high school to college, to a bit after college. Self-help maxims and cliches pretty much do apply to most of life, and it\u2019s not like popular self-help advice like \u201cdon\u2019t compare yourself to others\u201d and \u201capproach life with a growth mindset\u201d isn\u2019t good advice.\nHowever, since, I\u2019ve been a bit disaffected with self-help because I had been exposed to a lot of it, and with how much the world has changed in recent years, I didn\u2019t like how self-help commonly denies the role of external factors like systemic injustice and mental health.\nI read Ryan Holiday\u2019s The Obstacle Is The Way and thought \u201cdamn, I would have really liked this book four years ago.\u201d In 2022, a middle upper-class white guy telling people how to live their lives does certainly have undertones of insensitivity it didn\u2019t have in years prior.\nRegardless, I decided to read Mark Manson\u2019s popular self-help book, The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck for a variety of reasons. I was standing in the airport in Amsterdam, waiting for a train, and decided to pop open the book and give it a chance. Manson started with a very engaging anecdote about Charles Bukowski, and I decided I wanted to read more. I decided I wanted to read the whole thing.\nSo I bought the book at an overpriced airport book store and finished the book in two days.\nI didn\u2019t agree with everything Mark Manson said. I thought he was at times too abrasive, and reading his sections on how people adopt a \u201cvictim mentality\u201d seemed a little tone-deaf in this day and age.\nBut Manson is an incredible writer. As a writer, it\u2019s good to study his craft just to see how he tells stories.\nPlus, there actually was great, unconventional self-help advice in the book, in my opinion at least.\nI think every writer should read Mark Manson\u2019s book, not because of the self-help which has been tried and done\nHook your reader with an anecdote or story\n\u201cCharles Bukowski was an alcoholic, a womanizer, a chronic gambler, a lout, a cheapskate, a deadbeat, and on his worst days, a poet. He\u2019s probably the last person on earth you would ever look to for life advice or see in any sort of self-help book.\u201d\nThis is how Manson starts the first chapter of the book. He goes on to describe how Bukowski was an absolute failure of a writer, securing rejection after rejection. Bukowski spent most of his money on alcohol and gambling, and it would take almost 30 years before an editor at a small independent publishing house took an interest in Bukowski\u2019s work.\nHe decided to take the chance, and he decided to write a novel after signing a contract. Bukowski became a very accomplished and popular novelist, defying people\u2019s expectations and selling millions of copies of his books.\nOne narrative of Bukowski\u2019s success is he never gave up on himself, he kept trying, and he persevered.\nBut Bukowski had a different perspective: on his epitaph, it says \u201cdon\u2019t try.\u201d\nManson expands on this epitaph to make his points and expound upon his title. But I was really impressed with how he opened his chapters, in particular. Mark Manson starts each chapter with a very engaging anecdote. One is about the upbringing of Buddha, another is about a Japanese holdout during World War II, and Manson\u2019s struggles during the Great Recession.\nEach anecdote hooks the reader so Manson can give his greater points. It is a more unconventional self-help book, but Mark Manson\u2019s writing won me over. Yes, Manson can come off as arrogant, self-indulgent, or privileged. There\u2019s an excerpt where Manson admits to telling her wife she looks terrible when she took hours to get ready.\nTakeaways\nHowever, what Manson can teach writers isn\u2019t as much about content as much as it is about style. Yes, Manson curses a lot in the book, but the book is a number one New York Times bestseller for a reason. It has a pretty simple style and is easy to read, but it\u2019s also very engaging. Negative reviews of the book on Goodreads are people who love to hate the book.\nManson has a compelling title \u2014 who hasn\u2019t wanted to care less and worry more, especially in this day and age? It\u2019s more than the title, simple style, provocativeness, and anecdotes. He is incredibly unconventional for a field that can get as cliche as self-help.\nBut I find the anecdotes the best and most actionable takeaway for a writer. Start a piece or article here or there with an interesting story or anecdote, one that doesn\u2019t have to be about your personal life or story, but just a story that\u2019s interesting to you. There\u2019s a good chance that if it\u2019s interesting to you, it\u2019ll be interesting to your reader.", "comment_count": 2, "like_count": 278, "created_time": 1651633923790, "comment": [{"user_id": "63463afc4a3f", "comment_time": 1651633923790, "comment": "Why Every Writer Should Read Mark Manson\u2019s Self-Help Book \u2014 Even If You Hate Self-Help"}, {"user_id": "607fa603b7ce", "comment_time": 1651707575413, "comment": "I love how you emphasized the main point of your article by starting with a compelling anecdote of your own!"}, {"user_id": "5109f4ed5e94", "comment_time": 1651656150689, "comment": "Starting chapters with anecdotes is brilliant.

And it\u2019s hard to be categorized as white when you\u2019re darker-skinned (which was why southern Italians and Sicilians had a much harder time becoming \u201cwhite\u201d than northern Italians).\nThere\u2019s also a reason the U.S. census doesn\u2019t include \u201cMexican\u201d or any other Latinx group as a race \u2014 because, in the late 1920s, the League of the United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) and the Mexican government successfully lobbied to get \u201cMexican\u201d taken off the census. I did not know my North African and Middle Eastern friends also had to check off \u201cwhite\u201d on the census.\nThere was a historically legal advantage to claiming whiteness \u2014 the Naturalization Act of 1906 said only \u201cfree white persons\u201d and \u201cpersons of African nativity or persons of African descent\u201d could naturalize as American citizens.\nWhere, then, did this leave Asians in the early 20th century? Could they qualify as \u201cfree white persons\u201d or \u201cpersons of African descent?\u201d In the time period, the answer was no, but will Asians become white? Are we beneficiaries of white supremacy and white-adjacent?\nWell, it turns out some Asians tried to claim whiteness to become American citizens \u2014 ultimately, however, these attempts were unsuccessful.\nThe late 19th century and early 20th century were pretty hard times for Asian immigrants in America. The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 is one of the most notorious immigration bans in American history. This would not be the first legislation perpetrating anti-Asian discrimination, but it would be the most notorious during a time America became significantly more isolationist.\nOne notable but relatively piece of history is when the Supreme Court reinforced the constitutionality of nativist laws forbidding Asians from becoming American citizens.\nA lot of these laws and cases surrounded one central question: can Asians be classified as white? The answer from the federal government was clear \u2014 no.\nOzawa v. United States\nIf you can\u2019t tell by his name, Takao Ozawa was a Japanese man. According to Frederic Schwarz at American Heritage, nativism against Chinese immigrants was strong in the late 1880s and early 1990s, but Japanese immigration was negligible until the early 1900s.\nAt that period, however, 17,000 Japanese people were immigrating to the United States per year. Schwarz notes Japanese laborers, as workers, had similar reputations to Chinese workers \u2014 they were known as very hard working and assets, but once Japanese immigrants started their own businesses, they were seen as a threat.\nIn 1907, Japan and America had a \u201cgentleman\u2019s agreement\u201d to limit Japanese immigration.\nThe Supreme Court opinion says Takao Ozawa was born in Japan, and on October 16, 1914, he applied to be an American citizen in Hawaii. He had been living in America for 20 years. He graduated from a high school in Berkeley, California, and he spent three years as a student at the University of California.\nEssentially, Ozawa was very American, and his kids were raised in America and taught in American schools. His family spoke English at home, and his family attended American churches.\n\u201cThat he was well qualified by character and education for citizenship is conceded,\u201d Associate Justice George Sutherland said.\nHowever, the District Court of Hawaii said Ozawa was not eligible to be an American citizen due to being Japanese and denied his citizenship application.\nOzawa appealed this denial, claiming he could be naturalized as a Japanese man since he could qualify as a \u201cfree white person.\u201d\nHowever, this case defined a \u201cfree white person\u201d as a member of the Caucasian race, and Sutherland wrote that Ozawa was \u201cclearly of a race which is not Caucasian.\u201d\nThe Court made sure not to give any implication it was calling Japanese people racially inferior, only that Ozawa couldn\u2019t become a citizen under the qualification of being a \u201cfree white person.\u201d\nLegacy\nIt wouldn\u2019t be the first or last time during the time period anti-Asian sentiment was expressed, but technically, as an Asian-American, it was the naturalization law that declared only white or Black Americans eligible for citizenship that was more anti-Asian.\nThe Court just made a clear distinction that Japanese people weren\u2019t white and made a distinction on who was white and who wasn\u2019t.\nOn the very same day, however, the Supreme Court decided in Yamashita v. Hinkle that a Washington state law prohibiting Japanese people from owning property was constitutional. In 1923, in United States v. Bhagat Singh Thind that a Sikh man, who identified as \u201cAryan,\u201d could not be white due to a lack of physical characteristics.\nThis was a contradictory decision, according to Immigration History, because anthropologists considered Indians Caucasians at the time. For the Court, Thind didn\u2019t meet a \u201ccommon sense\u201d definition of a \u201cfree white person.\u201d\n\u201cThe conclusion that the phrase \u2018white persons\u2019 and the word \u2018Caucasian\u2019 are synonymous does not end the matter,\u201d Sutherland wrote.\nOzawa v. United States, Yamashita v. Hinkle, and United States v. Bhagat Singh Thind were all unanimous decisions by the Court.\nThe National Archives says the Immigration Act of 1924 would soon be passed, limiting the number of immigrants that could come from Asia. Of course, anti-Japanese sentiment famously escalated during World War II, when Japanese Americans were put in internment camps following the bombing of Pearl Harbor.\nIronically, anti-Japanese sentiment during World War II led to the repeal of all exclusion acts, particularly the Chinese Exclusion Act, in 1943. While Chinese immigration was still limited to 105 Chinese immigrants per year, Chinese-born citizens won the right to naturalization as well.\nFor the United States, it was the right political move \u2014 the U.S. Office of the Historian notes Japanese propaganda repeatedly referenced the Chinese Exclusion Act to sow discord in the alliance between the United States and China during World War II. Despite its half-measures in actually allowing Chinese immigration, Franklin D. Roosevelt called the Chinese Exclusion Act a \u201chistoric mistake.\u201d\nOnly the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, commonly known as the Hart-Celler Act, would completely abolish the quota system, skyrocketing immigration from Latin America, Asia, and Africa.\nEventually, immigrant groups did not have to claim whiteness to become American citizens after the Walter McCarran Act of 1952.\nToday, Asians might not be considered white on the census, but do many Asians have proximity to whiteness? And could Asians one day fall under the category?\nIn America\u2019s racial binary, it is possible, but it also remains true many non-Black minorities fall in an awkward place in America\u2019s racial discourse, particularly because of issues like proximity to whiteness, but also because of a long history of nativism and discrimination that revolves around issues of immigration.\nTakao Ozawa may not have ever been allowed to become an American citizen. But he and others did set the groundwork for future change and advocacy efforts.", "comment_count": 1, "like_count": 252, "created_time": 1650952439445, "comment": [{"user_id": "63463afc4a3f", "comment_time": 1650952439445, "comment": "Thank you for sharing!"}, {"user_id": "2cd0270760b", "comment_time": 1651521597349, "comment": "Well done!

We didn\u2019t know it at the time, but those extra three weeks meant that we could enjoy his birth unmasked, as a family, in a state of naivety that would soon be washed away by near-constant ambulance sirens. Now both he and the pandemic are turning two. Early on, he was sluggish in his milestone development, with a neck and spine content to round and slump rather than support. Luckily, his adjusted age graded him on a curve. Medical professionals gave him a little more time and space to reach his goals. It has benefited him so wholly and allowed him to grow into himself in his own timeline. Two years later, I think parents should also be given the same grace with an adjusted age of parenthood.\nSome wear motherhood well. Effortlessly, it suits them like flushed cheeks after a jog. But that\u2019s not me. The evidence that I have a toddler is on the walls of my kitchen and the pain in my lower back \u2014 but yet, in so many ways, I still feel like a new mother. Blinking at the sun after a period of extended hibernation with a volatile and unwieldy roommate. My relationships have atrophied, professional progress has been as smooth as a stick shift, and my sense of self has been so worn down that I purchased a necklace with my name on it to perhaps remind myself that I am not, in fact, MAMA.\nThe pandemic and subsequent erasure of supports forced me to contort into a SAHM shape. A flavor of motherhood that I had no taste or desire for. I know that all of us have had to contort, and that many of us are angry, sad, and/or numb. My issue has less to do with the feelings that have come up and more to do with society\u2019s unwillingness to tolerate the reality of these emotions and relentless hammering on blessedness. I am angry, and a smattering of $300 checks and the occasional like-minded parent focused op-ed do little to soothe my rage. For the last two years, I have been the baby stuck in the container, desperately wanting to get out, crying fat round tears, with red grasping palms. I see you baby. I feel you baby.\nThere is a biological imperative to put my son\u2019s needs first. Do you want more Cheerios? Did you throw your cheese? Are you thirsty? Meanwhile, my stomach works endlessly to distill sour lukewarm coffee into sustenance. It is hard to take care of yourself when every fiber of your being is thinking about someone else while multitasking a looming sense of dread. So you fall off to the side, like one of those cowboys riding a horse while clutching a gut wound. The horse keeps going and a woman in front of a pizza shop says that it gets so much harder when they\u2019re older.\nIn September 2021, the pandemic settled into a low simmer of anxiety and we started to look into childcare options. All of my hopes and aspirations were stuffed into a small family daycare in a second floor one bedroom apartment off Church Avenue. The staff there will never understand the fullness of my gratitude each and every time they physically take my son from me. For the first time we felt as though we had a village. They knew him and witnessed the last glimpses of his babyhood. Unfortunately, this sense of community was accompanied by a monotony of childhood illnesses that I was wholly ignorant of as a childless person. HFMD, croup, RSV, the adenovirus. Daycares became more vigilant than ever to protect against you-know-what and therefore my son\u2019s attendance hovered around 50%.\nWork ground to a halt and became untenable with a young toddler. The scale by which I measured joy was recalibrated to a child yelling \u201cBLUE SHOES!\u201d when he was in fact wearing blue shoes. Seeing the moon for the first time and now looking for it every single night. Learning how to spit intentionally and loving his mother\u2019s wet grimace. His joy became mine. I tried to do more, I tried to have my own, but it was too hard and I gave up.\nHe has become my whole world; my reason for living. I say that with less starry-eyed admiration and more so with quizzical astonishment at how my life became so single-minded. How did my life become so small? This child. This city. This season. He is all I have and I am all he has. It\u2019s not sustainable or healthy. It\u2019s just what it has been for nearly two years.\nRecently, my son has started to mimic the sounds of the alphabet with a confidence that astounds me. Pointing to letters, making random sounds, and grinning with absolute conviction that he has gotten it right. I\u2019d like to take this moment to steal a bit of that audacity and pour it into myself. We have all done what we needed to do. Some of us have even survived. It\u2019s crucial to grieve what\u2019s been lost in this adjusted age of parenthood. The moments that just washed away with an infancy that was never witnessed by friends and family.

To propel myself forward and reach the next milestone. I will try to build the block tower again and if I fail I will try again, and he will see me trying.\nWe\u2019re stepping forward into ourselves at the same time; twins in a pandemic born 35 years apart.\n\nTiina Treasure is a writer and therapist living in Brooklyn, NY.

I thought that as the human lifespan expanded that we would feel younger for longer instead of becoming older earlier. My childhood, colored with freebie AOL CDs and screeching modems is tucked firmly in memories that have been plied with to the point of unreliability. I feel slow and unresponsive in the present as technology evolves at a pace that I don\u2019t have the stamina or desire to keep up with. I\u2019m reminded of those sunflower yellow spiral wishing wells ubiquitous in central Florida malls. You dropped a coin to watch it revolve around the funnel with increasing speed. No matter how long it took, the end was always abrupt. Youth runs out the same way. Plink.\nThe hallmark of being middle aged appears to be less about the amount of time spent encircling the sun and more so how far away childhood feels. That distance breeds idolatry. Sweeping declarations of how things were different and mostly better, \u201cwhen I was a young.\u201d What I lacked in open wheat fields and local swimming holes I made up for with the Geocities websites and a deep proclivity towards the creation of fanart. A world of sharing pre-algorithm. A space that no longer exists, just like childhood.\nI started using the internet as a preteen in an era when A/S/L just seemed like a logical set of questions versus a predator\u2019s checklist. Our family computer was in the back corner of the den and thankfully ill-supervised. After a brief family mealtime sabbatical I would slip back to the computer under the guise of \u201chomework\u201d. Meanwhile, the only use the computers had at school was to occupy students with Snake while the teacher took a well deserved break to stare into nothingness.\nWith one eye trained on my parents to make certain that they were fully ensnared by America\u2019s Funniest Home Videos, I printed out hundreds of pages of Buffy fanfic, working quickly to staple the papers into neat piles with a robust feeling of success.\nMy parents\u2019 abundant confusion about what the internet was swung wildly between the computer as salvation and harbinger of death. They were scared and as such access to the internet was temperamental at best. Even after shrinking the font size I burned through reams of letter sized paper to accrue my late night stash. At bedtime I went to my room on the other end of the house, where I lived more or less alone. A home meant for a family of 8\u201310 and instead occupied by 3. With a flashlight under the covers I slipped into a world of OTPs, hurt/comfort, and Mary Sues. A world where the awkward girl is always told that she is beautiful. Where she is seen, held close, and cherished.\nInternet use became more normalized right around the time when my parents realized that it was possible to make a career of it. I quickly graduated from content consumption to content creation although we didn\u2019t call it that yet. With a bootleg copy of PhotoShop 4, I spent the remainder of my childhood creating X-Files fanart on DeviantArt and LiveJournal. The internet helped me feel less alone through the pivotal years of teenage arrogance and narcissism.\nIt gave me a cathartic space to link identity and interests when geography was at odds. I made a friend on a Star Wars message board that still sends me yearly Christmas cards updating my address every time I move. My internet friends made me feel normal and understood. It sounds simple but at 14 it can be a lifesaving act of insurrection.\nI used the internet as a refuge, a haven, when the reality of being a child in my home was too much to bear. It was a world to escape into without having to actually put in the work of running away. When my father canceled AOL I cried. At the time I was brushed off as being a melodramatic and now firmly fixed in my own adulthood I can see a pleading child yearning for safety and connection. That was my formative experience with the internet. It held me when no one else would.\nAs a child I used to describe the internet to my parents as if it was a library that they didn\u2019t have to drive me to. The world was just so much bigger than what was presented in front of me and that gave me hope. It\u2019s hard not to grieve the loss of what the internet has become and spiral into the waxing platitudes of someone so deeply disconnected from the present that they can only speak of the past. It was just a moment in time that was so much shorter than any of us anticipated. A childhood forged in the wilds of the internet.\nSearching was once the active process of hunting and foraging. Now it\u2019s an onslaught of promoted content, Machiavellian SEO, and algorithms that serve to promote divisiveness and commerce. Social media gamified sharing causing even the most casual user to curate their self expression. We ranked our friends, gave thumbs ups to acknowledge existence, and learned to summon a heart from the depths with nothing more than double tap. The long-form comment died around the same time that the word engagement became jargon.\nI\u2019m told that all swimming holes eventually get spoiled. They become discovered, polluted, and too often monetized. The internet has become a game where both user and content creator are exploited to the benefit of companies whose money is made on reach and impressions. More words that have become diluted in meaning. The hollow abundance of an audience instead of a small cohort of like minded internet strangers. We all have thousands of posts to engage with and not a single card at Christmas.\nIt\u2019s endlessly strange to wake up and realize that your generation is no longer synonymous with young. To realize that the tire swing no longer exists and instead you have to describe what it once felt like to tuck your feet into the well, lean back, and grip the chains so your fingers don\u2019t get pinched. The internet of my youth is gone. However, my experience with it was formative and lives within every long-form comment I leave and every internet friend I made. My absurdist belief that it can be a place of community and comfort. That safety is found where you make it and not necessarily where you live.\nTiina Treasure is a writer and therapist living in Brooklyn, NY.

It\u2019s 7:45 and my toddler is pleading for another book. I negotiate him down to a pithy one where the entire plot is to count dogs. In the kitchen my husband feverishly stirs the boxed macaroni and cheese, transforming powder into something edible. He pops his head out into the living room, pot still in his hands, to see that the contestant on Wheel of Fortune has no clue what the final puzzle is. I carry my son in his sleep sack to the window and we look out to see if we can spot the moon. \u201cNo moon!\u201d I affirm. He wants to look for longer but I pry him away, a little too eagerly. I tell him that his mother and father love him very much and I lay him in his crib, walking away slowly so that my body language does not betray my intent. I close the door and wait for the lock to click. \u201cWhat have I missed?\u201d I call out as I rush to the TV. \u201cIt\u2019s just the recap,\u201d my husband assures me as I collapse into the sofa and he nestles the steaming bowl covered in hot sauce into my hands.\nI started watching the Bachelor the year after I graduated with my Masters in Social Work. At the time I worked in a program that provided alternatives to incarceration for individuals with mental health and substance abuse issues. My job primarily consisted of fieldwork and I was a regular at shelters, methadone programs, and psychiatric units. My days were intense and too frequently sad. After work TV provided some respite but Game of Thrones no longer held the allure that it once did. I needed to disconnect into a world of fantasy, one that didn\u2019t involve beheadings.\nMy first season of the Bachelor starred Juan Pablo ambivalently plucking the petals off of a daisy playing, \u201cshe loves, she loves me not\u201d with beautiful 27 women. Anyone who\u2019s seen that season knows that it was a very bad year for the contestants and a very good year for the audience. I cringed at every \u201cit\u2019s okay,\u201d he uttered. As if saying those words could magically manifest emotionless women. Nevertheless, it was not Juan Pablo\u2019s journey that I was interested in. It was the women perfectly arranged behind him. The relationships between them and the glimmers of personality that hid behind an otherwise carefully crafted romantic narrative.\nJuan Pablo didn\u2019t find love that season, but I sure did.\nWhen I started watching the Bachelor my workweek anxieties softened. Yes, Monday still involved an ice-cold plunge into the lives of my clients but at 8pm I would be surrounded by predictably beautiful women all wearing a singular ubiquitous hairstyle. The Bachelor was easy. It was uncomplicated comfort. It provided a safe space where my mind could rest and the only thing I had to worry about was if Nick Viall was going to get his heart broken a third time. That, I could handle.\nWhen friends try to make plans on Mondays, I generally tell them I\u2019m busy without going into details. I don\u2019t have to subscribe to any definition of busy other than my own and maintaining my schedule and having some predictability and ease to look forward to is the cornerstone of my mental health. Any judgment about whether or not it\u2019s a worthwhile use of my time is simply not the point. I don\u2019t need more worthwhile activities; I need rest. Because if Chris Soules can survive a two-on-one date with Ashley I and Kelsey in the Badlands, well then I can certainly finish out the workweek.\nEmphasizing structure to maintain mental wellness isn\u2019t actually a new idea. In fact, it\u2019s a huge component of every psychiatric discharge plan I coordinate. When my patients are hospitalized for some departure from baseline I advocate for them to receive more structure and supports than they had prior to their admission. Whether it\u2019s an intensive outpatient program, respite center, or partial hospitalization program. They all have the same key components of structure and socialization. Allowing frayed minds space to heal and rest.\nThe truth is we all crave predictability and success. Routines help us to reduce stress and feel accomplished. As much as we tell ourselves otherwise, we like to know what\u2019s going to happen next. We want to be surprised, but only a little. So when the last rose of the night goes to the villain, we\u2019re shocked but only in that the producers have had their way with us yet again.\nThe Bachelor is my North Star. A fixed point in the week with well worn behaviors and rituals to help me to reset and mark the passage of time. It\u2019s eating dessert before supper. Spending a couple of hours at the beginning of the workweek with problems that are entirely manufactured.\nBecause there is nothing better than watching a group of grown men feign excitement over being sent to Rhode Island.\nLife will inevitably be full of surprises, but on Monday nights I already know what I\u2019m doing. It\u2019s just a routine, like reading books before bedtime, looking for the moon, and being told that your mother and father love you. We all need a centerpiece to build our weeks around. For me, it\u2019s a vase filled with roses, predictably red and thornless roses.\nTiina Treasure is a writer and therapist living in Brooklyn, NY.

They are flies on fly tape, struggling to break free of poor health and old age but just becoming weaker and more exhausted with each fight. At this point every unknown number with a 352 area code causes my heart to stall. Another fall alert notification. A frustrated EMT. A home attendant quitting. A doctor that wishes they could. I call the house line back and no one picks up because when my mother falls she rarely has the forethought to do it with the phone in her hand. So she waits in Florida, and I wait in New York, for the next call. For that call. In my experience the stepping stones that precede death are placed in chaotic measure. Death appears to be nothing more than a visit from a neighbor that you forgot lived around the corner. It\u2019s the waiting that kills you. Peeking in the oven before the pie is done baking.\nWe anticipated my grandmother\u2019s death for years. She had a habit of doing things the hard way and that well worn neurological groove followed her to the end. She was sand slipping through our fingers. Impossibly tiny grains that seemed insignificant until you noticed that the weight was gone and your cupped hands were empty. It\u2019s impractical to say goodbye to a person that is retreating slowly. She lasted six days without food or water after the stroke that rendered her still. The end was less a crescendo and more like a janitor coming to clean up after the movie had ended. Spilled popcorn, empty sodas, and a mother and daughter that won\u2019t leave until the credits finish. As if there\u2019s some virtue in staying after the story had ended.\nMy mother had just finished putting keys in the little dish by the front door when my grandmother\u2019s phone rang. A stranger from the nursing home said she was dead. They said it was common that people pass after their family leave for the day. That apparently no one wants an audience while dying. We took the elevator back down to the nursing home. Six floors to descend into a reality where she was fully gone. My mother cried and I held her. Haggard breaths sneaked past sobs. Our emotions which so rarely align manifested in identical grief. The shameful gratitude that it was finally over, matched with the devastating reality that it was finally over. For a few seconds in that elevator we were alone and more together than we\u2019ve ever been. Apparently the grieving don\u2019t like an audience either.\nAt the nursing home my mother took her rings and I found a mint green mohair cardigan with her name embroidered on the tag like a toddler. Her hands knitted that cardigan, back when she had effortless dexterity and physical presence that was at times intimidating. Until it was reduced. To what? A pot simmering for far too long on the stove, bits sticking to the bottom, burning to the point where there\u2019s no difference between the smell of death and dying. Sometimes the body just doesn\u2019t know when to quit.\nAfter my grandmother\u2019s death my mother\u2019s mobility was stolen in bits and pieces. I don\u2019t know if the two events are linked but emotionally they feel like cousins. The doctors call it ataxia but in my experience it can more plainly be described as repeat burglarizing of the mind and body. With every fall it steals a little more confidence, a little more strength, a little more hope. Eight years after we held each other up in that elevator my mother can no longer stand or even conceive of holding my child. For years I tried to keep the robbers at bay. Buying elastic shoe laces for her sneakers so she could put them on herself. Making frozen meals so they could eat well. Writing his pill schedule on the dry erase board so that he wouldn\u2019t have to ask. My mother has refused help at every step and my father has forgotten that I offered it. The elastic shoelaces atrophy in my sock drawer back home while she insists on wearing the same gold leather house slippers that she\u2019s fallen in dozens of times. At night my father takes out his hearing aid and can\u2019t hear her screaming. When I stopped traveling to Florida on a monthly basis due to factors both outside my control and deeply in my best interest they worsened and the robberies have been more frequent ever since.\nMy sister and I consider what options are available to our parents- her father, my mother. She reminds me yet again of how long my grandmother survived without any measure of life. As if I\u2019ve forgotten, when in fact the memory of that horrid ending and awareness of shared genetics loiter daily in my mind. I can hear my maternal ancestors snapping their fingers at me, \u201cHurry up and live while you still can.\u201d\nOur father wants to move into assisted living and my mother refuses to. She is 10 years younger than him and she knows all too well that if she goes in she\u2019ll never come out. He won\u2019t go without her and so they\u2019ve reached an impasse. Racing towards mutual destruction with a white knuckled grip on their rollators and a slew of home attendants at their hip. My sister suggests we start clearing out the attic and my mother refuses. Her stubbornness permeates cellular walls. She says we\u2019ll just have to deal with it all after she dies. I\u2019m frustrated but I also can\u2019t blame her. She has so little left to remind her of who she was. A collection of pig figurines, garage sale glassware, bootleg DVDs, and photo albums that are too heavy for her to open. She says she feels normal if she just doesn\u2019t move at all. An actress sitting on stage frozen just before the curtain rises. A life reduced to set dressing.\nThey are trapped in that house. It kept them safe until it didn\u2019t, and then another trip to the hospital. This time a longer one, pneumonia and Covid-19. Six weeks in the hospital and rehab. He lost 15 pounds and all of his meals are blended now. He says a hamburger milkshake actually tastes pretty good. Simultaneously, my own tiny family contracted Covid-19 as we crested the peak of Omicron in New York. I know we either got it from school or daycare but it really felt as if the virus traveled through those FaceTime and insisted on making it plainly clear how intertwined our lives still are. In quarantine with my husband and toddler whom I love more than anything but also fantasize about going on reality TV to escape. How nice it would be to go on a date with a stranger in Iceland. How nice it would be to not watch my parents die slowly. Stuck inside I trim the split ends of my hair on audio only zoom calls flailing wilding to stop the dead from spreading. Before you ask the question of how my parents are doing, ask yourself if you can hold space for me during the answer.\nI remember how my mother braided my hair. All the times she insisted on doing it, too hard, too tight, but also just perfect. How much I hated it then and how much I crave it at this very moment. It would an act of revolution to have maternal love run their fingers through my hair. To hold her hand and not be afraid to squeeze it. They shake constantly now. She can\u2019t type or sign her name. I\u2019m free to write whatever I want to online but I also know there won\u2019t be a birthday card in the mail come September. That penmanship that I could never aspire to has evaporated. My sadness is plaited tight to my skull, the baby hairs stinging.\n\nTiina Treasure is a writer and therapist living in Brooklyn, NY.

However, that raises the question of whether Russians are genuinely innocent and separate from the actions of their government.\nThis is a difficult question because, as we\u2019ve seen with the sanctions against Russia that disproportionately affect the average Russian living in the country, Russians are also the victims of Putin\u2019s policies. This image has only been exacerbated as we\u2019ve seen thousands of protesters stand up to what many call a fratricidal war and are subsequently arrested. Since February 24th, we have seen the rapid totalitarianization of the Russian state as we\u2019ve witnessed the censorship of Russian journalists and those who claim to call the war in Ukraine a war have been arrested. We\u2019ve seen the shutting down of sites like Instagram and Facebook in the country. Putin isolates the Russian people in a feeble attempt to control the narrative.\nHowever, as we\u2019ve seen with Putin\u2019s March 18th Moscow rally celebrating the anniversary of the annexation of Crimea and praising Russian troops to a packed Luzhniki Stadium, not all of Russia is opposed to the war in Ukraine. Therefore, it is irresponsible of us to think that the situation inside Russia is as simple as supporting or not-supporting Putin. Sentiments are complicated, and as we\u2019ve seen with the people packing the Soccer Stadium made to sit 81,000, Putin still garners significant support from his people. As a result, I think it\u2019s time to ask whether Russians are responsible for the war in Ukraine and how the philosophy of collective guilt and responsibility can help us navigate this complicated issue.\nShortly after the Russian Invasion of Ukraine was announced and the world stood in shock at the swift violence brought onto the Eastern European country, I was bombarded by messages from many Russian and Belarussian artists condemning what they deemed Putin\u2019s actions. There was and continues to be, in some cases, a separation between the activities of the Russian government and what the people want, at least according to those who fled Russia and arrived in Russia\u2019s neighbouring countries of Uzbekistan, Georgia and further to large Russian tourist countries like Turkey.\nAmongst all the demands to recognize that this conflict is Putin\u2019s design, that the Russian people don\u2019t want the war, don\u2019t support the war, and see Ukrainians as their brothers in history and ethnicity, a small YouTube channel, ShmowderProductions, made an interesting comment. This channel \u2014 run by a Russian engineering student and focused predominantly on a small, independently produced, and incredibly niche game Pathologic (\u041c\u043e\u0440. \u0423\u0442\u043e\u043f\u0438\u044f) \u2014 raised a nuanced and refreshing point in light of the Russian invasion.\nYou can probably guess what this is about. Few days ago I woke up and learned that my tax money have become bombs that fall on Ukrainian cities. I wish I had words to express how much this breaks my heart. How much it hurts to log on to Twitter on a daily basis and see my Ukrainian friends hiding in bomb shelters. How terrible it is to realize that (despite not having a say in the matter) I share a part of the blame.\nScreenshot of the ShmowderProductions community post condemning the Russian invasion of Ukraine\nWhat is significant about his post is recognizing that even if he is opposed to the war in Ukraine and the government's actions, he is still partially responsible. It is his government; it\u2019s his tax money funding the invasion; it\u2019s his fellow citizens killing Ukrainians \u2014 he shares part of the blame.\nRegardless of his recognition of his role in the conflict, the discussion around Russian collective responsibility is complicated, as is the idea of collective responsibility. As a result, I am going to try to provide an explanation of collective responsibility and highlight how Russia\u2019s war with Ukraine cannot just be blamed on Putin. Still, the Russian (and Belorusian by extension) populations share some responsibility for the conflict and its maintenance.\nCollective responsibility\nTo understand the nature of collective responsibility and orient our terminology to avoid confusion regarding the term, we must turn our attention toward the German-Jewish writer, philosopher, and social critic Hannah Arendt and her essay, \u201cOrganized Guilt and Universal Responsibility.\u201d\nArendt\u2019s essay was initially published in January of 1945, before the end of the Second World War, and was originally titled \u201cGerman Guilt.\u201d What can be deduced from the timing of the article\u2019s publication and the original title is that her essay's contents concern the German population's guilt and responsibility for the horrors of the Second World War and the crimes committed under the Nazi regime. But while this work is a deep philosophical analysis and condemnation of the genocidal war crimes of the Nazi regime, her analysis of the responsibility of the nation is timely, and the language she employed continues to be used to understand concepts of guilt and responsibility in times of crisis, war, and authoritarianism.\nShe explains that in totalitarian societies such as Germany\u2019s Third Reich, and we can extrapolate that further into Putin\u2019s Russia today, the individual is destroyed. This is because the state's actions cannot be separated from the actions or desires of the individual. As she explains:\nThe totalitarian policy, which has completely destroyed the neutral zone in which the daily life of human beings is ordinarily lived, has achieved the result of making the existence of each individual in Germany depend on either committing crimes or on complicity in crimes.\nAs a result, the state's actions, when it occurs in such an authoritarian and all-encompassing manner, put the population either in the role of the criminal or the accomplice. You are either actively participating in the criminal regime, or you are passively supporting it, making you complicit in the government's actions.\nThis is a popular narrative used by scholars who study the Second World War, the Holocaust, and Nazism. It is so popular because it\u2019s compelling and holds water based on what we understand society to have been like during Hitler\u2019s Germany.\nHowever, the issue becomes much more complicated when we start to look at collective guilt and responsibility. The idea of collective guilt is a lot more complex, and Arendt seems to assert that it has a nullifying and paralyzing effect \u2014 it is near impossible for everyone to be guilty of the crime. Still, they can be responsible for letting it happen, for being complicit in the system that allowed it to reach such an extreme. In the case of Nazi Germany, Arendt is referring to the Holocaust, the bodies found in Auschwitz, Buchenwald, Sachsenhausen, etc. In the case of the Russian invasion, we can extend that collaboration to the idea that this is a war of liberation for Ukrainians, that Russians aren\u2019t actively slaughtering and executing Ukrainians in Mariupol or Bucha. Instead, it\u2019s propaganda to demonize the benevolent Russian special operation.\nHowever, as was stated, believing that everyone is guilty is paralyzing. It prevents the ability of forces to persecute or confront those who are actively committing the crimes. As Arendt explains:\nWhere all are guilty, nobody in the last analysis can be judged, for that guilt is not accompanied by even the mere appearance, the mere pretense of responsibility. So long as punishment is the right of the criminal \u2014 and this paradigm has for more than two thousand years been the basis of the sense of justice and right of Occidental man \u2014 guilt implies the consciousness of guilt, and punishment evidence that the criminal is a responsible person.\nAccording to Arendt\u2019s definition, guilt can only be determined if there is a consciousness of guilt. Therefore, the person who perpetrated the criminal action is also the person responsible for initiating that action.\nAn example she provides to elucidate this point is a dialogue between a German war criminal and an American correspondent, who, after asking whether the man killed people in the camp (\u201cyes\u201d); buried them alive (\u201cyes\u201d); he personally killed people in the camp (\u201cAbsolutely not. I was only paymaster in the camp\u201d); we conclude that this man, in reality, did nothing technically criminal. He didn\u2019t personally murder those in the camp, did not personally gas millions, but he was complicit in the system. In this, we get Arendt\u2019s famous notion of the banality of evil, that even the process of murder can be bureaucratized and people so alienated from their guilt and responsibility it\u2019s hard to see that they did anything wrong.\nHe may claim that he did not want what had happened, that he was following orders, that he didn\u2019t personally kill those people, but, as Arendt laments, \u201cthe horrible part of it will still be that this is the fact.\u201d He may not have wanted the death, the war crimes, but he was complicit regardless and, as a result, is as responsible for the crimes as if he was the one to perform these actions personally.\nCollective responsibility then asserts while not everyone is guilty of the crimes of the state perpetrated on their behalf, they are still responsible for these crimes having been taken in their name. This is because they, in one way or another, supported the system, whether actively or passively, that allowed their governments to invade foreign, sovereign nations and murder the civilians of other countries in their name.\nWhat about Russian Protestors?\nPhoto by Kirill Kruglikov on Unsplash\nNow, you may be wondering how we can understand where the Russian protestors fit into this narrative of collective responsibility or even those who have fled the Russian state.\nAs we\u2019ve seen following the Russian invasion, there had been several decently sized protests within the major Russian cities, particularly in Moscow and Saint Petersburg, calling for the end of the war and condemning the actions of the Russian government. Since February 24th, there have been daily protests, with the latest updated number from March 13th registering over 14,900 Russians arrested for protesting or even acknowledging the war in Ukraine.\nThe figurehead for the anti-war protests within Russia is the longtime opponent of Putin, Alexie Navalny, who is currently imprisoned for trumped-up charges concerning a parole violation. Since the invasion, his organization \u2014 notable for their investigative work uncovering Putin\u2019s palace on the Black Sea \u2014 released two videos on their Youtube channel.\nThe first video, released on February 28th, defines the stance of Navalny\u2019s team and Navalny\u2019s supporters \u2014 that they are against the war in Ukraine and that Putin\u2019s actions and beliefs are not representative of Russians as a whole.\nHowever, the second video takes a much more active approach with the resonant cry of Navalny\u2019s team begging the population to unleash mass protests within and without Russia condemning the war in Ukraine and Putin\u2019s leadership. There is this sense, particularly in this video but also present in the first released by Navalny\u2019s team, that they don\u2019t want Russia to be regarded as a country that violated a nation's sovereignty without any push-back from the people. Navalny doesn\u2019t want Russians to be considered as supporting Putin or condoning such actions. He wants to present a Russia that is better than that.\nHowever, the call for mass protests on March 6th seemed to have fell flat. Despite the continuous demonstrations since the beginning of the war, the turn-out cannot be considered representative of the Russian population. According to a poll conducted evaluating the support for the war in Ukraine, 68% of Russians voted for it, while only 22% were against it, and the remaining 10% found it hard to say.\nBut what does that mean for the protesters?\nAccording to Arendt, we can use the Nazi example again to understand how we can understand where their responsibility lies. As she explains,\nThe most extreme slogan which this war has evoked among the Allies, that the only \u201cgood German\u201d is a \u201cdead German,\u201d has much this basis in fact: the only way in which we can identify an anti-Nazi is when the Nazis have hanged him. There is no other reliable token.\nThe same approach can be taken when evaluating the responsibility of the protestors. Their actions invalidate their responsibility. They are actively against Putin\u2019s regime in Russia and are working to counter it. We can be extended further by looking at those arrested. Those that don\u2019t bear responsibility for the horrors happening in Ukraine are those 14,900 who have been arrested or are sitting in prison. That\u2019s a minuscule number compared to the roughly 150 million people currently living in Russia.\nUnderstanding Russian responsibility\nSuppose we base our understanding of collective responsibility on Arendt\u2019s definition and apply it to our current situation with Russia and Ukraine. In that case, we get a damning the image of the Russian population as complicit, or even more dangerous, actively supporting the actions of the Russian government.\nIt\u2019s bad form to compare Putin to Hitler, and the narrative around this war between Russia and Ukraine being World War Three is a dangerous and insensitive one. However, there is some merit to the philosophies and understandings of guilt and responsibility that came out of this period. We cannot in good conscience claim that the Russian population is not responsible for the war or try to depict a stark divide between the wishes of Putin and the Russian government and those of the Russian people. It\u2019s a naive claim and denies the complexity of the issue of Russian and Ukrainian identity, relations, and history.\nEven the supposed hero of this story in standing up against Putin, Alexei Navalny, is a complicated figure. He has angered Ukrainians with his comments regarding the annexation of Crimea in 2014 and also condemned Putin for causing the Ukrainian Orthodox Church to schism from the Russian Church.\nUltimately, Ukrainian actress Irma Vitovska put it best when she published a comment statement with the Ukraine Crisis Media Centre on March 16th:\nToo few, and even now, on the 20th day of war, we see thousands of people taking to the streets in the Russian Federation to protest the war, but these are thousands among the 140 million people of the country [\u2026][Ukraine] has realized that the Russian population supports the criminal actions of its authorities [\u2026]People who do not oppose the criminal actions of their government share the responsibility with the government.\nThis is the gaze and perspective we evaluate Russia with. It is a nation of people complicit in the actions of their government and where the majority of the population supposedly supports the conflict. As Arendt frames, however, in a state that has become effectively totalitarianized like Russia, the boundary between citizen and criminal has been wholly effaced. We can no longer tell if we\u2019re dealing with Russians who secretly are complicit or are secret heroes against the state.\nThe only ones we know for sure bear no responsibility are those who have been killed or imprisoned by the Russian government.\nExcerpts are taken from \u201cOrganized Guilt and Universal Responsibility\u201d, published in The Portable Hannah Arendt, edited by Peter Baehr and published in 2003.\nAn Injustice!\nA new intersectional publication, geared towards voices, values, and identities!aninjusticemag.com", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 120, "created_time": 1646413177356, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Ukraine", "Russo Ukrainian War", "Russia", "War", "Politics"]}, {"author": "angela (\u0430\u043d\u0436\u0435\u043b\u0430)", "post_id": "2f7be89fd66c", "user_id": "2e29bdd296b", "title": "Social Construction, Soviet Science, and Our Relationship with Science Today", "content": "Social Construction, Soviet Science, and Our Relationship with Science Today\nA fringe Soviet scientist managed to change the way genetics was perceived for decades, shedding light on our views of science.\nPhoto by Pavel Neznanov on Unsplash\nAt the end of HBO\u2019s mini-series, Chernobyl, the nuclear physicist Valery Legasov states: \u201cThe truth doesn\u2019t care about our needs or wants. It doesn\u2019t care about our governments, our ideologies, our religions. It will lie in wait for all time. And this, at last, is the gift of Chernobyl. Where I once would fear the cost of truth, now I only ask: \u201cWhat is the cost of lies?\u201d Legasov says this as he is apprehended by the state, a result of his effort to reveal the truth of Chernobyl, particularly that it was a failure of Soviet science as much as it was a failure of Soviet policy.\nWhile this lecture is not concerned with the Chernobyl disaster, I feel that this quote reflects a predominant perspective concerning Soviet science, and that is that it is devoid of truth and is founded instead on lies. In particular, there is this predominant idea in the West that science in the Soviet Union is inferior, overly politicized and socially constructed \u2014 as if Western science is not a result of the same issues.\nThis lecture is not concerned with Chernobyl but deals instead with a complicated and long-running situation known as the Lysenko Affair, where a genetic theory, Lamarckian in essence, gained prominence in Soviet science agriculture, and politics, for almost 30 years before quietly fading into obscurity. Loren Graham provides some solid insights into this affair.\nBut who is Loren Graham? Graham is an American historian of science with a special focus on science within Russia and the Soviet Union. Much of his work addresses Lysenkoism, and he had even met Trofim Lysenko on a visit to Moscow in 1973. So why address Soviet science in a class that has, for the most part, only concerned itself with the paradigms of Western science? Well, Graham provides an answer in that \u201cit sheds light not only on the nature of Russia and the Soviet Union but also science itself\u201d.[1] What we say about Russian or Soviet science can also be said about Western science and science as a whole.\nSo, let us jump into the Lysenko Affair by starting with its namesake and the social background he came to prominence in. His biological and genetic theories will follow, followed by Graham\u2019s assessment of social constructivism and the strong and weak aspects of a social constructivist viewpoint. Finally, we will end with Feyerabend\u2019s assertion that science needs more Lysenko Affairs.\nTrofim Lysenko\nTrofim Denisovich Lysenko was born in 1898 in Ukraine, near Poltava, and was born into a peasant family. He was educated as a Practical Agronomist at the Horticultural Institute of Poltava. Between 1923\u20131965, Lysenko has published approximately 400 works concerning his studies in plant propagation and his theories on biology and genetics. By 1948 Lysenko had established \u201call the major components of his biological system.\u201d[2], as Loren Graham explains in his 2016 book, Lysenko\u2019s Ghost: Epigenetics and Russia. But what was Lysenko\u2019s biological system, and what makes it worth addressing?\nWhat characterizes Lysenko\u2019s views on genetics and biology is best described as an almost ill-informed and practical application of Lamarckian genetics paired with Russian peasant interpretations and understandings of nature and the growth of plants. As the Russian historian Loren Graham describes in the reading assigned for today, \u201cRussian, Science, and Social Constructivism\u201d:\nFor over thirty years, from the early 1930s to the late 1960s, the Soviet agronomist Trofim D. Lysenko opposed the Mendelian genetics that was accepted elsewhere in the scientific world and favoured in its place a form of Lamarckism, the doctrine of acquired characteristics.[3]\nThe support for Lamarckism and acquired genetics is not unique to Lysenko. It would be disingenuous to assert that he was the one to popularize the idea of acquired genetics within Russia. The idea of acquired genetics that traits acquired through life can be passed onto offspring and written into your genetic makeup had been popular in Russian leading up to the revolution and has longevity well into the Soviet period. As Graham asserts, \u201cLamarckian views were widespread among Russian biologists, especially young Marxists but also many non-Marxists\u201d.[4] It was a view, before the revolution, that Lamarckian genetics and Mendelian genetics were compatible, and Graham seems to assert that they provided explanations for the shortcomings present in both theories.\nFollowing the revolution and civil war that would rock Russia and the satellite states that would make up the Soviet Union, we begin to see a change in ideas of genetics and biology. While prior to 1917, many Russian biologists and geneticists toyed with and engaged thoroughly with the ideas of not only Lamarck and Mendel, but also Weismann, Darwin, and Kammerer, with the rise of Marxist science and a stronger class consciousness between the proletariat and the bourgeois, came to a change in what was popular science. An official consensus would emerge in the 1930s, as enforced by the Communist Party. Graham explains:\nIt held that Mendelian genetics was a suspicious field and definitely should not be applied to human beings in the form of eugenics. Lamarckian biology was favoured but only on the levels of plants and animals, not humans. Humans were explicable in Marxist terms, not biological ones.[5]\nFor the Communist Party, people could only be explained by Marxist terms. To be reduced to genetic qualities and traits seemed to undermine the Soviet mission of Marxist development and freedom.\nHowever, it is important to keep in mind that the idea of acquired genetics (Lamarckism) was never applied to humans, and this will extend to Lysenko, as well. His reach only went as far as farm animals. What is significant about this point is that it almost single-handedly undermines the Western conception that the rise of Lysenko and Soviet genetics was based on the desire to create a unique Soviet man, Homo Sovieticus, a notion even Stalin dismissed as ridiculous.\nWhy was Mendelian genetics suspect, and what led to the rise of this scientific change of perspective, though? The easiest response has been mentioned in passing, and that is the rise of class-consciousness, particularly a distaste and suspicion of the bourgeoisie following the Civil War, especially after Stalin\u2019s official coming into power in 1927. Many geneticists at the time were those who either came from aristocratic backgrounds or were of a member of the bourgeois class prior to 1917, and \u201cbecause many of the professional biologists had bourgeois backgrounds, their political loyalties were always suspect to the regime\u201d.[6] This meant that even their theories were viewed as suspect. They were inherently untrustworthy, and their perspectives were impractical or too bourgeois. Lysenko exploited this in asserting his biological perspectives and provided him greater credibility in the regime. He could position himself as a practical biologist up against academic biologists who, in his words, \u2018cared more about the flies they studied than the people of the Soviet Union\u2019.\nLysenko\u2019s Biology\nSo, what made Lysenkoism unique besides his adoption of Lamarckism and belief in acquired genetics? Graham goes in-depth into Lysenko\u2019s views on genetics in chapter six of his book, Lysenko\u2019s Ghost, as he discusses not only his views on genetic theory but how they fail or are wildly uninformed and unoriginal, given the framework of the time he is living in. There is too much to discuss on that front in this lecture, but three aspects of Lysenko\u2019s biological theories make up the foundations of his work.\nThe first is that he believed that the whole cell was the carrier of heredity, not just its constituents.[7] As a result of this, Lysenko also refused to accept the existence of dominant and recessive alleles.[8] An allele is one, two, or more versions of a gene, of which you inherit two from each parent \u2014 in the case of humans. I am not a geneticist, so I cannot explain all the nuances of the problems of his point, but as you can see, Lysenko\u2019s ideas of genetic transfer are in direct conflict with what we consider to be standard genetics.\nHis second point is the most damning in his denial of modern genetics:\nLysenko also denied the distinction between phenotype (the observable characteristics of an organism that result from its genotype and the environment) and genotype (the genetic makeup of a cell), even over the distance of one generation. Instead, he maintained that \u201call the properties, including heredity, the nature of an organism, arise de novo to the same degree to which the body of that organism (for example, a plant) is built de novo in the new generation.\u201d The obliteration of this separation lay at the bottom of much of Lysenko\u2019s writings and repudiates the whole structure of modern genetics.[9]\nFor Lysenko, he refused to accept that different types of plants or animals produced things differently. Instead, he firmly believed that you could force characteristics on different plants or animals to make them work for your expectations.\nLysenko is famous for working with wheat and cows, but mostly for his work with wheat. He spent much of his life arguing that you could force summer wheat to grow in colder climates if you could force the plant to acclimatize to the colder climate in its growth process. Through what Loren Graham describes as cold stratification, Lysenko believed that given enough generations of wheat, it could grow in colder, more northern climates it had previously been unable to survive in. His experiments failed on a large scale, but he retained political support despite lacking scientific rigor and unsuccessful experiments.\nLysenkoism came to the significance and remained due to a mixture of three things, Stalin and Khrushchev\u2019s respective ignorance regarding genetics and genetic theory, Lysenko\u2019s strong ability to curry-favours, in particular by denouncing seemingly bourgeois geneticists who opposed his ideas \u2014 many of these scientists would die in the custody of the NKVD (the predecessor of the KGB) or a gulag. However, Lysenko was fairly successful in producing practical results for a state in crisis. As Graham explains, he successfully got the peasants to plant wheat for the Great Soviet Experiment rather than destroying it \u2014 a problem that had plagued the Soviet Union almost since its inception.\nAs a result, \u201ca peasant agronomist who promised a revolution in agriculture had enormous political advantages over sober academic geneticists who \u2014 in a time of crisis \u2014 appeared to be restraining progress by crying \u201cnot so fast,\u201d or \u201cinadequate verification\u201d.[10] Lysenko presented a quick and practical response to a state that was slowly starving itself to death and had failed to inspire the countryside to engage with collectivization. He could get the peasants to plant wheat. But, unfortunately, the academic scientists could not point to any concrete results or benefits their theories could have to the state at this time. As a result, Lysenkoism was adopted at official state policy over Mendelian genetics in 1948, partially a result of eugenics following WWII, and would last well into the 1960s.\nSoviet Science and Social Construction\nI have just explained to you some of the history of Lysenkoism, particularly how it came about, its unique characteristics, and its strength in seemingly practical results. Now it is time to turn to social constructivism, particularly the role Lysenkoism plays in our idea of science as a social construct. Graham asks, \u201cTo what degree is science a social construction and to what degree is it a reflection of the natural world?\u201d \u2014 he spends the rest of his paper, \u201cRussia, Science, and Social Constructivism\u201d, attempting to answer this question.\nHe explains that in the 1970s, following the publication of Kuhn\u2019s work, sociologists of science, people like David Bloor, whom you have read for today, began to address the question as to whether knowledge produced and accepted by scientists is shaped and formed by the society that surrounds it. According to Graham, even the hardest of sciences like mathematics, biology, physics, and chemistry, given this framework, can be and are socially formed.\nThis eventually leads us to the central concern of his work, where he asserts that \u201cif the social constructivist thesis is correct, Russian science should be very different from Western science\u201d[11], since their social frameworks are different and seemingly incompatible. Following this claim, he brings us to his thesis that Russian or Soviet science can reflect both the strengths and weaknesses of this social constructivist viewpoint. There are cases in which Soviet science is vastly different from Western science and cases where their sciences are quite similar, or sometimes even supplant each other.\nIt is clear from Graham\u2019s introduction that he is sympathetic to the social constructivist viewpoint. However, he does not leave it unexplained for his readers who are less familiar with the concept, especially science. As he states:\nFor most people approaching this issue for the first time, the strength of the anticonstructivist viewpoint will probably seem obvious, while the constructivist approach will seem counterintuitive. Many people, after all, look on science as \u201ctruth,\u201d or something close to it, and therefore fully expect science to be the same everywhere, to be \u201cinternational.\u201d[12]\nHe will spend the rest of the paper provides a strong argument supporting social constructivism in science and end with a weaker case \u2014 but overall, he settles on the point that there cannot exist a universal, absolute truth. So let us dive into it.\nThe Strength of the Social Constructivist Viewpoint\nGraham begins with what he deems as the hardest to illustrate, which is the cases that support the social constructivist thesis that Russian science must inherently be different. But, first, he explains that, in particular Soviet science, can be reduced to Marxist influences: \u201cIn the Soviet period, both overt (and officially supported) Marxist influences and covert (and officially opposed) anti-Marxist influences were at work\u201d.[13] This made Soviet science unique, especially because its science can be divided between Marxist theory in science supporters and those of its detractors. Alternatively, in simpler terms, Soviet science is divided between those sympathetic to the Communist Party line and those who are critical of it. He provides examples in support of both positions, but I will only address two.\nA significant position in support of Marxist theories in science is the case of the \u201cinflationary model\u201d in astrophysics. A model even Stephen Hawking found compelling.\nThe influence of ideology on Soviet astrophysicists was noted by the British cosmologist Stephen W. Hawking in his best-selling book A Brief History of Time, in which he explained their opposition to \u201cbig bang\u201d theories of the universe by Marxism; Hawking, no Marxist himself, was so impressed by their work that he came to oppose the big bang theory himself, supporting instead a version of an \u201cinflationary model\u201d worked out by Soviet researchers and others.[14]\nThe inflationary model or theory proposes a period of rapid and exponential expansion of the universe in the first few moments of its existence. It posits that the universe is gradually expanding over time and had gained popularity in the 1980s as an explanation for the holes present in Big Bang Theory. It is compelling that this theory arose out of opposition to the singular idea of the Big Bang on Marxist grounds. It seems to provide evidence in support of ideological science.\nGraham\u2019s second significant example, this time coming from the critics of Marxism and Soviet policy, is a field I am much more familiar with, and that is Soviet ecology and environmentalism. Graham cites Douglas Weiner, the foundational historian in Russian and Soviet environmental history, who explains that resistance to Soviet industrialism on ecological grounds lead to the development of \u2018biocenosis\u2019:\n\u2026resistance to Soviet industrial development by ecologists strengthened their commitment to the theoretical concept of \u201cbiocenosis,\u201d the self-enclosed ecological community protected from all industrial incursions. These ecologists created what Weiner has called \u201carchipelagos of freedom\u201d nature preserves (zapovedniki) off-limits to all intruders, including Soviet ideologists.[15]\nZapovedniki is foundational to Soviet environmentalism, and what Weiner describes is the strength in ideological opposition in the creation of different scientific frameworks.\nFor Graham, these examples highlight the strengths of the social constructivist viewpoint in science, especially because this is science directly influenced by the social milieu at the time. These are theories and positions developed out of a pro- or anti-Marxist position within the Soviet Union. It illustrates that science cannot be separated from the political, or at the very least, the ideological, as there seems to be science either for or against the given political framework/paradigm or ideology in vogue at the time.\nHowever, it would be too easy to stop right there, and, at this moment, you are probably wondering why I spent so long diving into Lysenkoism and obscure genetic theories. Well, this leads to what Graham considers to be the weakness of social constructivism.\nThe Weakness of the Social Constructivist Viewpoint\nSince I have already gone over the Lysenko affair and provided an idea of Lysenkoism as a theory, I do not need to go over it again. It is important to keep in mind his central point with regards to the Lysenko Affair, however, in revealing the weaknesses of the social-constructivist viewpoint, and that is: \u201cThe weakness shows up not in the onset of Lysenkoism but in its demise\u201d.[16] This is important to remember because, if anything, the onset of Lysenkoism can serve as a strong example supporting social constructivism. It is a unique Soviet perception that arose out of the social milieu of the Soviet Union at the time, in particular a state in need of food production and a geneticist with the ability to make the peasants work, as opposed to the academic geneticists who were viewed as halting progress.\nThe demise of Lysenkoism is an interesting one because there was nothing dramatic with its slow decline from popularity. Instead, it seemed much more like a substitution of one scientific viewpoint with the other. Graham provides an in-depth account of Lysenkoism\u2019s collapse and its significance. In the 1960s, we see the return of Mendelian genetics to the Soviet Union. As Graham states, \u201cIn other words, the socially constructed doctrine of Lysenkoism was being undermined by contradictory scientific evidence, a powerful alternative cognitive scheme, and the convincing results of agricultural practices based on Western-style genetics\u201d.[17] Western genetics was much more scientifically rigorous than Lysenkoism and carried further explanatory power than Lysenkoism provided. Moreover, mendelian genetics agricultural applications had also led to outperforming agriculture in the West than anything the Soviet was able to provide.\nNowhere else is this better exemplified than in Nikita Khrushchev\u2019s visit to the United States in 1959:\nWhen Nikita Khrushchev visited Roswell Garst\u2019s corn farm in Iowa in the early 1960s, he was staggered to learn that no farmers in Iowa still grew their seed corn; instead, they all purchased their seed corn from commercial breeders, who used the principles of Mendelian genetics that Lysenko denied.[18]\nThere was substantial and irrefutable proof by Khrushchev\u2019s visit in support of Mendelian genetics and its explanatory and practical powers. Moreover, western agriculture was thriving, as opposed to Soviet agriculture, which was always markedly slow and relatively inefficient in comparison.\nIn the 1930s, when Lysenkoism was gaining traction among Western geneticists, there was still a sense of uncertainty regarding heredity and genetics. For example, scientists were unsure whether heredity was carried in proteins or whether DNA was a significant substance. This scientific uncertainty provided an opening for Lysenkoism to apply its explanatory powers onto the nascent Soviet state.\nBy the 1960s, however, the concept of heredity and Mendelian genetics was much more concrete \u2014 Lysenkoism seemed backwards in comparison. As a result, we eventually see Lysenkoism undergoing rigorous critique and condemnation. Lysenkoism was being challenged by Western scientific development and agricultural practices, and it was a system deemed wanting.\nHowever, Graham hesitates to assert that Lysenkoism was overthrown or supplanted by Mendelian genetics. Instead, he uses the term substitute. As he explains:\n\u2026what was happening is not best described as the refutation of Lysenko\u2019s genetics by scientific and agricultural reality but the substitution of one social construction of genetics by another \u2014 the replacement of Lysenko\u2019s genetics by Western genetics, both of which are social constructions.[19]\nGraham almost single-handedly, with his last comment, dismisses the notion that Western science is superior to Soviet science. Instead, he reduces these scientific frameworks to the same level, stating that both result from their respective social milieu.\nHowever, he does seem to assert that there are limits to social construction. It does not have universal explanatory power. He argues that social construction stops at the demise of Lysenkoism. Social construction is not what kills it either, but rather is the role of cognitive factors, theoretical rigour, and practical success. This seems to be the key to Graham\u2019s argument. What causes the demise of socially constructed paradigms is when their practical successes, theoretical rigour, and cognitive factors no longer seem to work or work less efficiently compared to the theory it is up against. According to Graham, this does not mean Mendelian genetics represents absolute truth, and he refuses to accept that Mendelian genetics is not socially constructed in the same way Lysenkoism is. However, \u201cExperimental evidence and straight thinking do matter, and Lysenko was deficient in both\u201d.[20]\nFor Graham, this is why Lysenkoism failed. Not because of the supposed inferiority of political and ideological science, but rather due to the lack of scientific rigour. Something Graham seems much more offended by concerning Lysenkoism than its ideological bent. The leash of reality is long and slack, as Graham states, but it is still present and still reinforces the strength of the theories, even if socially constructed.\nPost-Kuhnian Anarchy\nPaul Feyerabend will also look at the Lysenko Affair but takes it in a much more radical direction than Graham does \u2014 seemingly taking Kuhn\u2019s relativistic idea of paradigms to their logical extremes. Seemingly fascinated with Kuhn\u2019s tentative assertion that Newtonian Physics can be put on the same pedestal as Aristotelian Physics, Feyerabend asserts that there should be more Lysenko Affairs in science. Who is Paul Feyerabend, and what is the purpose of this claim?\nPaul Feyerabend was born in 1924 and died in 1994. He was born in Vienna, served on the Eastern Front in WWII, and is best known for his work at the University of California, Berkeley. There he wrote his three major works: Against Method, Science in a Free Society, and Farewell to Reason.\nBut besides that, he is best known for his controversial and supposedly anarchic views towards science, particularly with his rejection of universal methodological rules. However, he is significant in the establishment of the sociology of science. I think we get this sense from the reading you had to do for today, \u201cHow to Defend Society Against Science\u201d, that Feyerabend is a man testing the waters and almost purposely shit-disturbing to make a point. While there is a lot to talk about in his work, with many controversial and wild assertions made in his paper, I am concerned with his support of Lysenkoism and the power he thinks affairs such as Lysenkoism have on complicating science.\nFeyerabend says this about science and Lysenkoism:\nConsidering the sizeable chauvinism of the scientific establishment, we can say the more Lysenko affairs, the better (it is not the interference of the state that is objectionable in the case of Lysenko, but the totalitarian interference which kills the opponent rather than just neglecting his advice).[21]\nThe chauvinism he seems to be referring to in this comment is that of doctrinaire science. He asserts earlier on in this section of his article that \u201cscience is just one of the many ideologies that propel society and it should be treated as such\u201d.[22] As a result, for Feyerabend, science is inherently ideological. It cannot separate itself from the social milieu, the social ideologies, the social paradigms that are present. The chauvinism that Feyerabend is referring to then, regarding Lysenkoism, is that of science playing the role of gatekeeper. He directly responds to those who cried out in outrage of the relativism that Kuhn\u2019s theory of paradigms had suggested \u2014 that perhaps Lysenkoism and Mendelian genetics can sit on the same pedestal.\nFeyerabend is arguing for a conversation between theories, an interaction between ideologies and paradigms. He does not see why Mendelian genetics but be held up as the pinnacle of genetics when Lysenkoism could provide an interesting rebuttal to Mendelian genetics seeming monopoly on hereditary knowledge. As Feyerabend explains, \u201cIdeologies are marvelous when used in the company of other ideologies. They become boring and doctrinaire as soon as their merits lead to the removal of their opponents\u201d.[23] For Feyerabend, we need to engage with all ideas, not just the supposedly superior ones. T\nhe Lysenko Affair provides an interesting alternative in much the same way that Flat-Earth theory presents an alternative and critique of round Earth. Unfortunately, there is no such thing as a universal truth for Feyerabend. As a result, he sees only a benefit to engaging with these supposed inferior theories. To ignore them is to create instead totalitarian, dogmatic science and makes us no better than Trofim Lysenko in denouncing and removing his most ardent critics.\nLysenkoism in Science Today\nDespite the concept of acquired genetics being out of vogue in the West since the early twentieth century and controversial in Russia since the 1960s, the fact that the theory of acquired genetics has actually gained traction as a legitimate and substantial theory has gained traction since 1991. Loren Graham discusses the rise of acquired genetics, or what has become the accepted term for it, Epigenetics, in his 2016 book. Since the publication of a paper by O.E. Landman in 1991, there has been an increase is incredulity at the idea that acquired genetics is contradictory to inherited genetics.\n\u2026O. E. Landman published an article expressing incredulity that so many biologists remained convinced of a basic contradiction between the principle of the inheritance of acquired characteristics and molecular biology. On the contrary, he wrote, the inheritance of acquired characteristics is \u201cfully compatible with current concepts of molecular genetics,\u201d and he pointed to examples of such inheritance. These developments provided an important background and a prehistory to the blossoming of epigenetics in the early years of the twenty- first century.[24]\nThe idea that these genetic theories are mutually exclusive appears to be reductive, although Graham goes on to explain that evidence of acquired genetics still isn\u2019t solid enough to be universally accepted, it provides an interesting perspective and change to Mendelian genetics.\nGraham explains that epigenetics is strongest in the cases of trauma, in which he explains that methylation, a response in times of extreme stress and trauma seems to affect DNA but is a physical configuration that is reversible. The Dutch famine and its generation effect, in particular, the increased generation rate of disabilities and obesity caused by extreme starvation is often used as an example in favour of the theory of epigenetics, although it is only tentatively accepted in the field of genetics.\nHowever, the concern of epigenetics has become an incredibly politicized issue in Russia, particularly there has been a rebirth in Lysenkoism and the view that \u201cLysenko was right\u201d. Wading through the neo-Stalinist hot-takes considering Lysenkoism you do end up getting some insightful points that seem to reaffirm Feyerabend approach to weighing both perspectives equally in scientific discourse. Graham paraphrases a Russian epigeneticist, Shatalkin who claims that: \u201cClassical geneticists are \u2018correct\u2019, he says, in what they \u2018affirm\u2019 but incorrect in what they \u2018deny\u2019. They deny Lamarck\u2019s and Lysenko\u2019s valuable contributions to the science of heredity\u201d.[25] This position has even been taken up by other Soviet historians, such as Kate Brown who has spent much of her career studying the history of nuclear power and its effects in the former USSR. She lauds Lysenko in making Soviet scientists sensitive to the intergenerational transfer of radioactivity and other toxins on DNA while acknowledging his detrimental role not only in genetics but in politicizing science in the Soviet Union. As much as science can truly be separated from politics, its ideologies, and the impact of the social milieu.\nConcluding Remarks\nI began this lecture commenting on our Western view of Soviet science, our position that we see it as a product of lies, that somehow it is inferior to the science we do and have done in the West. I hope this position doesn\u2019t sit as right as it might\u2019ve prior to this lecture, especially given Loren Graham\u2019s strong position that what is discussed about Soviet science applies just as comfortably to Western science. The argument that Soviet science is socially constructed and overly politicized works in the reverse, our own Western scientific conceptions are as equally constructed as our Soviet and Russian counterparts.\nSociety frames and shapes what we consider to be \u2018real\u2019 science, what we deem acceptable. All of this is constructed around our social ideals and ideologies. Lysenkoism was the scientific ideology of Soviet genetics, Feyerabend would argue that Mendelism was the scientific ideology of Western genetics. In order to avoid the totalitarianism of both ideologies, the rise of dogmatism and chauvinism within science, these ideas must be weighed equally. Graham will argue that there are limits to the reality that counters Feyerabend\u2019s extreme anarchy that everything is equal, but he still asserts that what ultimately impacts the rise of theories, their knowledge background, and their significance is all contingent on the social framework, the paradigm, that these theories emerge. He advocates for scientific rigour in this process, but even Feyerabend will argue that what we consider the scientific method or rigour is socially constructed.\nI hope this idea feels destabilizing and unsatisfying because I think it\u2019s supposed to. Even though Graham tries to assert that method will ensure science that reflects reality will flourish, there is this lingering uncertainty, especially with the Lysenko Affair. What is stopping Western science from having its own Lysenko Affair? And should we encourage more of them?\nThis was originally a lecture presented at the University of King\u2019s College, on November 18th, 2021\n[1] Graham, Social Constructivism, 468\n[2] Graham, Lysenko\u2019s Ghost, 82\n[3] Graham, Social Constructivism, 472\n[4] Graham, Lysenko\u2019s Ghost, 60\n[5] Ibid., 67\n[6] Graham, Social Constructivism, 472\n[7] Graham, Lysenko\u2019s Ghost, 83\n[8] Ibid., 89\n[9] Ibid., 92\n[10] Graham, Social Constructivist, 472\u20133\n[11] Ibid., 469\n[12] Ibid., 470\n[13] Ibid.\n[14] Ibid., 470\n[15] Ibid., 471\n[16] Ibid., 471\n[17] Ibid., 474\n[18] Ibid.\n[19] Ibid., 474\u20135\n[20] Ibid., 475\n[21] Feyerabend, Defending Society, 7\n[22] Ibid., 6\n[23] Ibid., 7\n[24] Graham, Lysenko\u2019s Ghost, 201\n[25] Graham, Lysenko\u2019s Ghost, 122", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 5, "created_time": 1646238008271, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Science", "Soviet Union", "Genetics", "Philosophy", "Social Construct"]}, {"author": "angela (\u0430\u043d\u0436\u0435\u043b\u0430)", "post_id": "8a111ff911ec", "user_id": "2e29bdd296b", "title": "Ruin Porn: What Tarkovsky\u2019s \u2018Stalker\u2019 Teaches us About Nature", "content": "Ruin Porn: What Tarkovsky\u2019s \u2018Stalker\u2019 Teaches us About Nature\nThe 1979 Soviet sci-fi classic teaches us about confronting our own finality in light of environmental degradation.\nScreenshot from Stalker (1979). Directed by Andrei Tarkovsky.\nDespite Andrei Tarkovsky\u2019s famous condemnation of science-fiction as overly commercial and superficial, he had managed to bookend the 1970s with two of his most famous films, Solaris and Stalker. The 1979 film, Stalker, has garnered widespread interest and praise. At the time of its release in the Soviet Union, it was well-received and was distributed in the West, where it garnered a cult following. Stalker was Tarkovsky\u2019s last film to be produced in the Soviet Union, after which he exiled himself to Western Europe, landing himself in a migrant camp in Italy for a short period. His last two movies were filmed in Italy and Sweden, his final film, The Sacrifice, being released in 1986, the year of his death.\nThe Film that Almost Killed its Director\nThe mythos around the film is as significant as the film itself. The script was finished in 1976, but the filming would become one of Tarkovsky\u2019s most tortuous and troubled of his career. The initial plan was to film in Tajikistan, but an earthquake ruined their ability to film there. In response, Tarkovsky searched for other areas to film in the Soviet Union, looking into Uzbekistan, Georgia, and Ukraine, but ultimately decided on Tallinn, Estonia. Tarkovsky chose a handful of former industrial areas around Tallinn, notably a ship repair yard, an abandoned oil-processing factory, and most famously, an abandoned hydroelectric station, destroyed in the Second World War. These areas would make up the fenced-off Zone, with all locations being treated as found, regardless of the pollution or contaminated water.\nIn Spring and Summer of 1977, the exterior scenes were shot, and the film was processed. However, all the film was tinted a dark green colour, effectively ruining the movie. All shots that were done would have to be re-done, meaning another season of filming on a budget that was already maxed out. Tarkovsky ended up firing his cinematographer and condemned the production of Stalker as cursed following a minor heart attack in 1978. The film was changed into the longer two-part film we know today to secure the funding to re-shoot.\nCatering to the mythos that the production of Stalker was cursed is the fact that three of the people who participated in production would die a few years following the release of the film, all of the same disease. Tarkovsky, his wife Larisa, and Anatoly Solonitsyn, who played the Writer, all died of lung cancer within the decade after production. Sound recordist Vladimir Sharun believed that the deaths of these three were exacerbated by working in the contaminated conditions, particularly in wading through the oily, polluted waters the film spends so much time focused on.\nSetup and Plot\nThe film is loosely adapted from the 1971 novel, Roadside Picnic, written by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky. The book is a dark satire of the Soviet Union and was heavily censored by Soviet authorities upon release. Tarkovsky, however, was fascinated with the book and worked for years writing what would ultimately become Stalker, taking inspiration from one section of the book that follows a Stalker into the Zone.\nStalker is a bit looser with its sci-fi connections. The book it referenced took place in a fictionalized country, unnamed, surrounding one of six Zones left behind by extraterrestrials. Much like the film, however, there are disturbances in the Zone, disrupting the rules of nature and \u201cconfronting brave visitors with their true selves and granting their deepest wishes.\u201d\nThe film sets up the nature of the Zone differently, leaving it purposely ambiguous so that at the end of the film, we\u2019re uncertain whether the Zone has powers at all. The film opens with text \u2014 a supposed interview with Nobel Prize-winning Professor Wallace and an RAI correspondent. We\u2019re never told who Professor Wallace is, but he recounts this uncertainty of what it was that created the Zone and whether cordoning off the Zone was beneficial, as he states:\nWas it a meteorite or a visitor from outer-space? Whatever it was, in our small country, there appeared a miracle \u2014 the Zone. We sent in troops. Not one returns. Then we surrounded the Zone, with a security cordon. We did right\u2026 although I\u2019m not sure. I\u2019m not sure.\nThis sets the tone of the film and establishes its sci-fi elements with some ambiguity. Were the visitors from outer-space aliens or just a meteorite? Following the opening text, we are presented with the film proper. In simplest terms, the movie follows a Stalker and his companions on their singular journey into the Zone, towards a room that grants wishes. However, while the Strugatsky\u2019s journey into the Zone is more akin to a dystopian road-trip story, Tarkovsky\u2019s takes the form of a sombre, spiritual quest. With this setup, we are introduced to our characters.\nCharacters\nThere are three main characters in Stalker. All are referred to by aliases or nicknames. Even Stalker\u2019s wife and daughter remain obscured in fake names or titles, but the most telling are the main three: Stalker, Writer, and Professor. There is a scene in a bar before the three enter the Zone, where the Writer attempts to introduce himself to the Professor, but Stalker intervenes with the remark, \u201cHe will be referred to as Professor.\u201d The Zone requires anonymity, and in that vein, we are to engage with these characters through their titles and archetypes.\nThe Stalker, played by Alexander Kaidanovsky, is a former convict, intense and demanding discipline from his companions. Nevertheless, he relishes in the Zone and exclaims upon entering the Zone proper, \u201cHere we are, home at last.\u201d As the film repeatedly states, he is one of God\u2019s fools and sits as the spiritual center of the film. He is one of the first characters we meet as he sneaks off from his home and leads the Professor and Writer deep into the Zone. While he is a former convict, he feels trapped and imprisoned everywhere outside of the Zone and laments that only in the Zone can one find freedom.\nThe Writer, played by Anatoly Solonitsyn, is a famous writer, although we are not told what he was written. He\u2019s a drunk and seems to be on the verge of a crisis, as he seems to have lost his inspiration but only isn\u2019t entirely convinced that it is inspiration that he needs. He acts as a foil to Stalker, often rejecting the ideas of miracles or the dangers of the Zone, notably represented in his first monologue when we\u2019re introduced to him: \u201cMy world is so unutterably boring. There\u2019s no telepathy, no ghosts, no flying saucers. They can\u2019t exist. The world is ruled by cast-iron laws. These laws are not broken. They can\u2019t be broken.\u201d\nThe Professor, played by Ukrainian actor, Nikolai Grinko, is a physicist who enters the Zone supposedly for study and is accused of using the Zone to acquire a Nobel Prize from the Writer. It is later revealed that the Professor had entered the Zone to get revenge on a colleague and blow up the Room with a 20-kiloton bomb to prevent the Room from falling into the wrong hands. He abandons this plot when it is revealed that the Room only grants your most secret desires, not specific wishes. He is the most familiar with the history of the Zone and has a vague knowledge of the background of our Stalker and reveals that the daughter \u201cis a mutant, a so-called Zone victim.\u201d\nMonkey, or Martyshka, played by Natasha Abramova, is the Stalker\u2019s daughter. She gets little screentime but is a child of the Zone, a mutant, but the miracle at the film\u2019s end. She presents the twist that miracles don\u2019t just exist in the Zone but are present as home. She is always framed in colour, similar to the Zone, which reinforces the connection that she is a product of the Zone. Unlike the rest of the monochrome sepia world outside the Zone, she is somehow connected to inside the Zone.\nThe Stalker\u2019s Wife, played by Alisa Freindlich, is a long-suffering woman that introduces us to the concern of time in the film, with the question of her watch and her wasted years. However, she breaks the fourth wall at the end of the film, telling the audience why she married a Stalker and that she doesn\u2019t regret the sorrow because, without sorrow, happiness would not exist.\nThe film dives deep into the Zone with these five characters, playing with images of restriction, spirituality, and introspection. The film is incredibly meditative with its longshots and lingering gaze onto the natural world, and it feels more like poetry on-screen, with Tarkovsky giving you no easy answers to what the film is trying to say. Tarkovsky purposely denies restrictive interpretations of his work, and, as a result, his films are complex and rich with analogy, metaphor, and in the case of Stalker, poetry.\nThemes and Interpretations\nIn response to the complexity and nuances of Tarkovsky\u2019s film, Stalker has many interpretations and theories as to what the film is about, and I don\u2019t have time to go into all of them in detail. Still, I want to highlight some of the most popular interpretations of the themes depicted in the film.\nThe first interpretation is that the film is about pursuing desires and finding hope and faith through arduous journeys. We see this in the fight at the end when the Stalker accuses the Professor of destroying the hope. We also see this tension in the Writer refusing to accept the strangeness of the Zone, his agitation at miracles, and his eventual condemnation that the Room grants wishes. Tarkovsky was, famously, quite spiritual and religious, and we see these images in parts of this film, as with many of his other ones. While this is a significant part of the film, however, it would be remiss to claim that the film\u2019s only message was one of believing in miracles and faith. The film depicts a sombre, spiritual journey, but it covers more.\nAnother possible interpretation of the film is an analogy and subversion of the haunted history of the gulags and prison camps the Soviet Union is infamous for. Ryan Madson, in his excellent article on the film, \u201cPost-Stalker: Notes on Post-Industrial Environments and Aesthetics,\u201d addresses this interpretation and dismisses it as too restrictive, stating:\nFilm critics have proposed reading the Zone allegorically, perhaps representing the gulag or the militarized borderlands between the Soviet bloc and the West. But such readings are ultimately too restrictive, and Tarkovsky famously resisted overtly symbolic or single-metaphor interpretations.\nWhile it is hard to miss the references to gulag and camp life in Stalker, as is represented in the language of \u201cZona\u201d and \u201cthe meat-grinder,\u201d and Kaidanovsky\u2019s gaunt features and characteristic Zek shaved-hair, the reading is a bit reductive to the film and it ignores the way the film subverts this idea of freedom. The Stalker exclaims, \u201cThey took everything from me behind the barbed wire. Everything I have is here. Here, in the Zone\u201d. Instead of freedom being found in the world outside of the Zone, the Stalker finds his home, his freedom, and comfort in, amongst nature inside the barbed wire of the Zone.\nAnother possible interpretation is that the film is about asylum-seeking. All three characters are on the run from something in their lives, the Stalker is a convict, the Writer chafes under a restrictive government, and the Professor risks detention for his attempted destruction of the Room and the Zone. This film was the last film made in Russia by Tarkovsky before he became an asylum seeker. However, even this reading feels too restrictive even for Tarkovsky, who was known for his autobiographical characters and his insertion of his philosophies into his films.\nA theme that has gained the most traction both academically and popularly is the connection between the environments in Stalker and that of the environmental disasters within the Soviet Union. Some have even gone as far as to argue that Stalker prophesied the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. While that argument is a bit dubious, the belief that Stalker was prophetic does hold water in that it gave us the language to discuss these post-industrial landscapes and disasters \u2014 much like the landscape of the Zone. In addition, Tarkovsky was invested in nature and fascinated by it, going as far as stating in an interview:\nOften we remove nature from films because it seems useless. We exclude it thinking we are the real protagonists. But we are not the protagonists because we are dependent on nature. We are the results of its evolution. I think to neglect nature, from an emotional and artistic point of view, is a crime.\nAs a result, we see how the environment can be hostile yet beautiful. There is a haunting beauty in the Zone that is concerned with environmental degradation and could be extrapolated further onto radiation. The argument of radiation and ecological degradation isn\u2019t unfounded, as Tarkovsky would address similar issues in his last film, The Sacrifice.\nRadiation and Environmental Degradation\nIn our earlier discussion of characters, it can be argued that I left someone out of the list, and that character is the character of the Zone. The Zone takes on a central role within the film, almost surpassing our sickly and agitated protagonist, the Stalker. The entire colour palette of the film shifts once our ensemble enters the Zone, shifting from a monochromic, industrial sepia filter to these rich, vibrant scenes of lush environments over-taking melted and moss-covered tanks, oily wells, rushing pipes, and dark-brown foam rippling uneasily on the surface of the water. The setting is polluted but is also beautiful. As Ryan Madson puts it eloquently,\nTarkovsky\u2019s landscapes are alive with elemental forces. Sun and rain, wind and fire, and tangles of vegetation animate his long takes and complex tracking shots. His cinematographer\u2019s fixation on limpid currents of water is a notable example. Nature is a real and vital force in Tarkovsky\u2019s cinematographic language.\nWe see nature\u2019s vital force exacerbated in Stalker, as the Zone is an actively hostile place with warnings, such as the Writer\u2019s false voice telling him to stop and the hawk diving towards the group in the room of sand, and active threats such as misleading the Stalker and Writer. These threats are invisible, however, creating a labyrinth of hidden landmines that could kill and trap a man within the Zone \u2014 supposedly the disappearing of soldiers and travellers due to such dangers. The Stalker tells us early on that the trip is short, but one rarely goes the shortest way; there is too much risk.\nThis closed Zone is most similar to a concept in Russian and Soviet ecology, known as a Zapovednik. \u201cZapovednik\u201d \u2014 a Russian term literally meaning an \u201carea given special legal protections\u201d that has more broadly come to mean \u201cnature preserve\u201d in discussions of Russian ecology. Russia currently has 102 zapovedniks with some being implemented before the 1917 Revolution and having been sustained throughout the tenure of the Soviet Union and beyond. Unlike American or Canadian National Parks that sought to preserve the environment \u201cfor the benefit and enjoyment of the people,\u201d as was declared when the first American National Park, Yellowstone, was established, Russian conservationists instead sought to protect nature from people. Vast portions of the Russian environment were closely guarded, restricted, and observed to ensure that the nature within was uninterrupted by human interactions or interventions. These ideas would\u2019ve been familiar and well-known amongst the popular consciousness in the Soviet Union, and it would be remiss to think that Tarkovsky was not inspired by such concepts in his development of the Zone.\nThe Zone we see our three main characters journey deep into can be interpreted in this vein. It is most literally an area that is given special legal protections and protected from humanity, whether to protect people from what\u2019s inside or to protect what\u2019s in the Zone from humanity. Both arguments can be made given the actions of the film. The Writer and Professor are hostile to the Zone, interrupting, disrespecting it, and ultimately trying to destroy what is miraculous in it. But we also see that the Zone is also hostile, full of invisible hazards and as Madson describes, it is a maze-like space full of imperceptible landmines.\nThese invisible threats can be interpreted as analogous to hazards of radiation or pollution, ironic since the film was filmed in heavily industrial and polluted areas. In the 1970s and earlier, concerns about environmental degradation and contamination were rampant throughout the Soviet Union. Much like in the West, environmental movements were gaining traction and, while Tarkovsky made no direct comments on the ecological issues of his time, it would be hard to believe that he wasn\u2019t aware of the environmental concerns floating around in the 1970s, especially as a member of the intelligentsia.\nTwenty years before the film\u2019s production, there had been catastrophic nuclear crises and problems in the Urals surrounding the closed city of Ozersk and the Mayak Plutonium Plan. The plant contaminated the surrounding area to the point that children were suffering mutations and severe cancer. The area around the closed city eventually became its own kind of Zone, in a way, not as dramatic as the Zone of Alienation following the Chernobyl disaster but significant regardless. A good book on the topic is Plutopia by Kate Brown, as she delves into the nature of these invisible environmental threats and Zones not just within the Soviet Union but also within the United States.\nWhile it is unknown whether Tarkovsky was influenced directly by what had happened in the Urals, especially since much of the details were classified, or whether such stories made it back to him indirectly, the scenario does present a touchstone as to where he would\u2019ve gotten inspiration especially since much of what happened in Ozersk was during his lifetime, throughout the 1950s and 60s. Furthermore, the \u2018mutated\u2019 children are referenced in the character of Monkey, the Stalker\u2019s daughter, as she has no use of her legs, has a shaved head that remains covered, and is quite sickly. Therefore, it can be extrapolated that the children of the Zone are those who suffer from a specific sickness. In this case, it can be inferred that it is radiation-induced childhood cancer or disabilities.\nMany children born with radiation-induced deformities often came from parents who had high levels of exposure. In the case of Monkey, her father is a Stalker, sickly himself, and it can be interpreted that the invisible threat in the Zone is not just these miraculous landmines, but also high levels of radiation brought on by a meteorite or visitor from outer space. Which is what uranium is, as a product of supernovas. This knowledge is treated as well-known. The Stalker\u2019s wife mentions that she was well aware of the kind of children Stalker\u2019s have before she married him, and the Professor and Writer casually discuss the mutations and risks brought on by the Zone. It\u2019s a method to bring the audience closer to the characters. Still, it also suggests that the audience watching this film in the USSR would\u2019ve been aware of where these metaphors are coming from, whether directly or indirectly.\nThe most popular way Stalker is used in the discussion of Soviet environments and radiation is in the conversation about the Chernobyl disaster, particularly in how we engage with these post-industrial environments and how Stalker provided us with the language and aesthetic framework to understand such crises.\nRuin Porn and Aestheticized Destruction\nIn the film, we are provided with a landscape with a backstory. As the Professor explains to the Writer:\nAbout 20 years ago, they say, a meteorite fell here. It razed the settlement. They searched for it, but they found nothing, of course. Then people began to vanish. Finally, it was decided that this meteorite was not quite a meteorite. So, as a start, they put up barbed wire to stop the inquisitive taking risks [\u2026] They started to guard the Zone, like a treasure.\nWe are presented with an environment that has, in recent, memory been destroyed and abandoned by humanity. In an aesthetic sense, the land is labelled as post-industrial, which is reflected in nature, reclaiming the space left by humanity. We see overgrown fields, knocked over power poles, and buildings flooded and left open to the elements. Tarkovsky lingers on these scenes, letting the audience soak up these vibrant and harrowing environs.\nThe film has been lauded as the progenitor of the aesthetic movement called Ruin Porn. Madson provides a solid description of Ruin Porn, what Tarkovsky got right, and why it is attractive. He explains that ruin porn\n\u2026offers dereliction and decay where the romance of the picturesque ruin is amplified by the absence of people. Civilization has apparently forsaken or forgotten these places.\nIn essence, Ruin Porn is best described as finding pleasure through engaging with sites of destruction and decay. This is the aesthetic language and framework that has since been used to understand and engage with places of post-industrialism.\nMadson argues that Tarkovsky\u2019s immersive, beautiful, and horrifying world of Stalker had opened up new ways to conceive of our finitude, our anxieties and fears \u201caround abandonment, failure, and the unknown.\u201d Moreover, it had managed to do that, creating a dangerous yet banal post-industrial Zone that can be confronted with three bolts tied with bandage cloth. As he elaborates:\nWithin a post-industrial landscape that turns banal and lethal, the Stalker appears to possess some limited agency. The Zone is a minefield, a labyrinth, a trap. The Stalker guides his companions through a post-industrial wilderness with its own rules and rites of passage. And their passage is physical, an embodied experience that relies on all the human senses and not just the visual. Tarkovsky\u2019s camera lingers upon the trio as they glide along a railroad track, wade through industrial canals, and trudge through tunnels. An earthiness and pervasive dampness are conveyed throughout, helping the viewer to empathize with the characters and experience their journey more viscerally.\nWe are soothed because, while this Zone is labyrinthine, it can be tackled, and there are specialists who journey into the Zone, Stalkers. We are further comforted in Stalker\u2019s embrace of the nature of the Zone, the flowers, the puddles he wades through, and the mossy patches he chooses as his bed for a quick nap. Nature is celebrated for its regenerative properties. It is free to reclaim its space, unlike the Stalker, who inevitably has to return from behind the barbed wire. This place also feels like a holy place, a place that can only be traversed by one of \u201cGod\u2019s Fools\u201d, by those who enter the Zone with no other desire than to lead people to hope. There is an optimism in that.\nMadson claims that Stalker \u201canticipated a recent emphasis on regenerative landscapes and the increasingly popular acceptance of unmanicured nature in cities.\u201d There is an optimism prompted by Tarkovsky\u2019s humanist philosophies and \u201cour entanglements with the post-industrial world.\u201d Madson posits locating a new kind of post-Stalker humanism or metaphysics that focuses on the regenerative properties of urban and industrial ruin. There is a relief in the idea that nature will do what it always does and reclaim its rightful space in the world when we are gone.\nI want to take Madson\u2019s point further, however, and argue that in some ways, we have found our post-Stalker form of humanism, as exemplified in the narratives that surround post-industrial environments like the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone. Within the realm of \u2018ruin porn\u2019 when discussed Chernobyl, there is a wary acceptance of the ultimate fate humanity can expect to encounter.[1]\nIn this sense, ruin porn becomes a valuable method to approach the finality of humanity by removing death somewhat from the imaginary terrain and forcing it into reality. No longer is the apocalypse reserved for the future, but it becomes part of the here and now.[2]\nChernobyl, and Stalker by extension, force us to encounter the inevitable. While we can be optimistic about nature\u2019s return to the Zone, we do have to grapple with our extinction in that same vein. Perhaps there is a comfort found in the fact that in both Stalker\u2019s Zone and Chernobyl\u2019s Zone, humanity could not survive in these places, and we can be optimistic that our finitude isn\u2019t the end of the world. We can take lessons from the post-humanist space on our planet \u2014 that there is a future beyond us.\nIf you don\u2019t accept that there is comfort in post-humanist or post-industrial spaces, don\u2019t worry, you\u2019re not the only one \u2014 and even Tarkovsky, I don\u2019t think, would argue that the Zone is a reassuring place. But, if we apply the lessons of Stalker to Chernobyl, New York Times writer Mark O\u2019Connell describes our relationship with this post-industrial landscape as ironic and uneasy. As he states:\nThis is the colossal irony of Chernobyl because it is the site of an enormous ecological catastrophe. For decades now, this region has been void of human life; and it is effectively a vast nature preserve because it is void of human life. To enter the Zone, in this sense, is to have one foot in a prelapsarian paradise and the other in a post-apocalyptic wasteland [\u2026] It was astonishing to behold how quickly we humans became irrelevant to the business of nature.[3]\nSimilar can be said about Tarkovsky\u2019s Zone, and it is both apocalyptic and a post-humanist paradise. We are trespassers, after all, just experiencing the Zone for a few hours as we watch three men journey through sopping landscapes and fight over hope. However, as we pass through this Zone, Tarkovsky challenges us with these questions about our post-industrial world, questions of how it presents itself, and how we deal with catastrophes that threaten our existence. These questions are only more pressing as we now have to grapple with our Zone and what we want our post-industrial world to look like.\nOn a more practical level, Stalker provided those who had to work on the ground in Chernobyl a language they could understand. The Zone was an obvious one, an area that had obvious invisible threats, and was maze-like in the way radiation could shift and make once safe areas incredibly dangerous. In a similar vein, liquidators, those sent in to clean up the reactor, level nearby villages, and bury irradiated forests started, in some cases, referred to themselves as Stalkers. It was a cultural touchstone, and while the film provides a new aesthetic language, it also provided the framework to understand the Chernobyl disaster on a different level. This was an area touched by disaster, that emptied villages, and caused some to vanish and only those who could enter were those trained on how to navigate the maze of Chernobyl \u2014 not with bolts and bandages, however, but with Geiger counters.\nConclusion\nEven though this film almost killed him, Tarkovsky managed to create a new way of thinking of our environments, clearly influenced by the world that he was living in at the time \u2014 coming to terms with its environmental problems and concerns. As Madson claims, \u201cHe unintentionally developed an aesthetic of the post-industrial, an aesthetic which still feels contemporary\u201d and I would argue that the timelessness of aesthetics and themes of the film are only exacerbated with the existence of our Zone and our confrontation with catastrophe as we face climate change.\nTarkovsky purposely left interpretations of Stalker open, refusing audiences any easy answers to their questions. Still, audiences, critics, and academics have latched onto the ecological qualities of Stalker and how it managed to provide us with a language to deal with crises and Zones almost a decade before the world had to grapple with such a catastrophe. It offers an uneasy glimpse into a world without us, especially when our home and everything we\u2019ve ever loved sits beyond the barded wire within the Zone. The film even depicts the futility of fighting the Zone because it is part of nature and cannot be destroyed once it arrives. So, we are left with this challenging vision of our role in a future post-industrial world we\u2019ve created where miracles can exist, but they come at a cost.\nThis was originally a lecture presented at the University of King\u2019s College on February 3rd, 2022.", "comment_count": 1, "like_count": 70, "created_time": 1646237188574, "comment": [{"user_id": "2e29bdd296b", "comment_time": 1646237188574, "comment": "Thank you for sharing!"}, {"user_id": "13ca6703ab7d", "comment_time": 1646656847179, "comment": "\"The whole is more than sum of all single parts\" a brief translation of what Aristotels summarized in Metaphysik VI 17, 1041 b."}], "post_tag": ["Film", "Andrei Tarkovsky", "Stalker", "Environment", "Ruin Porn"]}, {"author": "Medium Creators", "post_id": "245edb548fd7", "user_id": "6a8bd9ed65dc", "title": "May Updates from the Partner Program", "content": "May Updates from the Partner Program\nCalls for submissions, our new design publication, and May payments\nAnimation by Shira Inbar\nOn Medium, we\u2019re growing the opportunities for writers and editors to share great stories with eager audiences.\nMost recently, we\u2019ve launched the design publication Modus; we partnered with Better Programming, a handy resource for programmers everywhere; and we have started sharing weekly writing prompts for our personal essays publication Human Parts.

Solovjov fled his home city only to come back days later, and then to leave again for a city further west \u2014 where he\u2019s waiting, like the rest of the world, to see what comes next.\nOn Medium over the last few days, Ukrainians like Solovjov \u2014 residents of Kyiv and Kharkiv who only days ago were dropping off their children at school or meeting for coffee in the park \u2014 have published anguished, bewildered dispatches from their apartments; a former BBC commentator has offered crucial perspective on the geopolitical landscape the war in Ukraine is being fought on; and former President Barack Obama published his statement on what this war means for us, now and in the future. \u201cOver the long term,\u201d he wrote, \u201cwe all face a choice, between a world in which might makes right and autocrats are free to impose their will through force, or a world in which free people everywhere have the power to determine their own future.\u201d\nIn various ways, Ukrainians have been fighting to maintain their freedom for centuries. And while Vladimir Putin insists that Ukraine is not a \u201creal\u201d nation, the citizens of Ukraine have a very different story to tell. It\u2019s impossible to ignore their voices, and their stories\u2019 reminders: that peace is always hard-won, and freedom is an immense privilege.\nBecause Medium exists to deepen our collective understanding of the world \u2014 all of it, all the time \u2014 we thought we\u2019d share a few of the truly singular perspectives on the Russian invasion of Ukraine that we\u2019ve come across over the last week. Most were published recently. Some were published years ago, but are suddenly more relevant than ever. These stories illuminate the war by either zooming in to tell a specific (often personal) story or zooming out to provide important context. We hope they give you some much-needed perspective \u2014 both at the geopolitical level and the human one.\n\nFrom the Medium archive, this longread by former Moscow correspondent for The Economist Noah Sneider tells the thousand-plus-year history of Russia and Ukraine. Sneider, who grew up in Moscow, spent weeks in Ukraine during the 2014 annexation of Crimea and spoke with Ukrainians and Russians alike. As Sneider writes: \u201cTwo nations riding fundamentally incompatible historical narratives have crashed. The stakes could not be higher, and not simply because Russia fears NATO expansion, but because Russia fears losing its brother, losing its family, and thus losing itself.\u201d\n\nMedia sociologist Jeremy Littau advises us to think carefully about the words we use to describe what\u2019s happening in Ukraine. Whether you refer to the situation as an \u201cinvasion,\u201d a \u201cwar,\u201d or a \u201cconflict,\u201d you\u2019re making an implicit judgment about the facts.\n\nCould we have stopped this? Former economics editor at BBC Newsnight Paul Mason answers that and other questions you\u2019ve (probably) asked yourself over the last week in this Q&A, originally published just before Russia\u2019s invasion on February 24. Follow Mason on Medium and check his profile for more recent developments \u2014 he\u2019s shared several breakdowns of the war.\n\n\u201cThe Russian people have had to sacrifice their freedoms, their finances, and frequently their lives at the altar of Putin\u2019s power,\u201d writes Whitney Milam in a sweeping profile of the man who has ruled Russia for a total of 16 years.\n\nAuthor and New Yorker columnist James Surowiecki interrogates the idea that violent conflict in Europe ended with World War II. In fact, as Surowiecki writes, Ukraine has been fighting separatists in the provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk for almost a decade. This has been anything but a cold war.\n\n\u201cThe easiest way to control a population is to control what they see and hear,\u201d writes Steve QJ in this guide to the tactics Putin (and autocrats before him) have used to stay in power.\n\nUkrainian human rights activist Nataliia Buchkovych writes from Kyiv, where she is reporting on Russia\u2019s war crimes and the Ukrainian army\u2019s defenses. Buchkovych concludes: \u201cWe don\u2019t want war. However, we definitely will not let Russia subjugate us. We will resist with all our hearts.\u201d\nFor more stories that contextualize the war in Ukraine, browse this list.

Our goal is to make it as easy as possible for people to explore that network broadly \u2014 discovering new ideas and perspectives \u2014 and deeply \u2014 connecting with authors and topics that offer consistent insight and knowledge. To that end, we\u2019re excited to introduce a newly designed Medium experience on the web, available to just about everyone starting today. (If you don\u2019t see it yet, you will soon.)\nFor several months, we\u2019ve been experimenting with new interfaces (first introduced here) aimed at making the Medium web experience more cohesive and more connected. Along the way, we\u2019ve made several improvements to the speed and responsiveness of our site, and the results have been strong. With the new design and improvements, we\u2019ve seen readers finding more stories they like on their homepage, and we\u2019ve also seen that readers are more likely to continue reading multiple stories once they arrive at medium.com. Writers are easier to discover and follow, and their stories are reaching wider audiences.\nTaken together, we believe these changes will benefit the entire Medium ecosystem.\nConsistent, streamlined navigation\nAll the core elements of your Medium experience are now in one persistent navigation menu, making the site simpler to explore. Your homepage, lists, notifications, and account settings stay with you as you read. Similarly, claps, responses, share buttons, and bookmarks are conveniently located across the bottom of your reading screen.\nOn the right side of your screen, we\u2019ve introduced a new space to provide additional context and information about what you\u2019re reading, and to offer connections to other relevant Medium stories and writers.\nClaps, responses, share buttons, and bookmarks are now located across the bottom of your reading screen\nA persistent navigation menu: your homepage, lists, notifications, and account settings stay with you as you read\nBranching Out\nOn the newly designed Medium homepage, in addition to recommended stories and stories from authors you follow, we now have a dedicated space that offers even more recommended writers and topics.\nDiving deep\nWhen you\u2019re reading a story, the right side of your page will update to show you more about the author, and it will also present an opportunity to dive deeper by exploring other relevant stories. On writer profile pages, you\u2019ll learn more about them, see who they follow, and easily access any reading lists they\u2019ve created.\nWhen you\u2019re reading a story, the right side of your page will update to show you more about the author, and help you find other relevant stories to read\nThank you\nTo the readers and creators who\u2019ve been testing this with us over the last few months \u2014 thank you. Your feedback has helped shape the experience we\u2019re releasing to just about everyone today.

The traditional and majority translation of this verse reads reads: In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God\nRemember when I told you I wasn\u2019t going to throw bible scriptures at you in this book? I lied. But I lied just this one time. John 1:1 says, \u201cIn the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.\u201d I\u2019m not necessarily a Christian, but this is a fascinating image.\nAt the start of time, language existed, which implies that God lives within the language we would evolve to use and is inseparable from the power of the divine. I could end this chapter right here because I just laced you with the central idea. But I\u2019ll elaborate. What is language? John 1:1 is a gorgeous sentence, a simple phrase loaded with nuance, so imagine what it could suggest for a second regardless of your religious inclination.\nWe know that John 1:1 isn\u2019t objectively true from a scientific viewpoint. Right? We know that words didn\u2019t technically exist before everything else, especially without human beings alive to speak them. In the beginning, there were probably trees, some water, rocks, a couple of animals and insects, and a handful of single-celled organisms.\nAsimov\u2019s Guide to the Bible is a work by Isaac Asimov that was first published in two volumes in 1968 and 1969, covering the Old Testament and the New Testament, respectively. He combined them into a single 1296-page volume in 1981. They included maps by the artist Rafael Palacios\nBut when we peel apart what our biblical ancestors meant metaphorically, some insights start to surge. Thanks to Isaac Asimov, a renowned science fiction writer who wrote the classic book The Foundation, I\u2019ve learned to understand this quote a little better. Asimov wrote another book called \u201cAsimov\u2019s Guide to the Bible: The New Testament: 002,\u201d In it, he links John 1:1 to the greek philosophy of Thales Miletus. According to Thales, the world isn\u2019t chaotic. Instead, existence has a structure, an implicit balance governed by the rules of nature, and we interrogate these rules thanks to observation, thinking, and most importantly, language. This meant that God fashioned the world through very perceivable constants.\nIn journeying toward what John 1:1 actually means further, I found only English approximations gave us the phrase \u201cthe Word.\u201d Our biblical ancestors were not just referencing \u201cword,\u201d as in the smallest element of a sentence, but \u201cthe Word,\u201d with the W capitalized. Paying attention to a slight distinction like this is the difference between Hercule Poirot solving a murder and not, and unless we travel into the Aramaic language, we miss out on what our biblical ancestors were referencing. In the Aramaic, \u201cthe Word\u201d translates to \u201cMemra,\u201d not \u201cword,\u201d as in the piece of a sentence. Without boring you with too much of the specifics, \u201cMemra\u201d means consciousness, expansion, matter, and manifestation. It implies a vision held, the process of expression that expands that vision into a central force.\nThe translation of \u201cMerma\u201d into \u201cthe Word\u201d isn\u2019t entirely off-base either. There are a lot of connections we can make if we go further down into the rabbit hole. For example, why wouldn\u2019t the English translators use \u201cconsciousness\u201d to define the experience our biblical ancestors intended? As in, \u201cIn the beginning, there was consciousness.\u201d In addition, the original Greek translation has \u201cLogos\u201d in place of \u201cMemra,\u201d much closer to the Aramaic than the English approximation. Logos means \u2018word,\u2019 but it also denotes the entire rational structure of knowledge. And as more and more philosophers took up the term \u201cLogos,\u201d it came to refer not to some abstract entity but to a thing, even a human being: the person who had created this orderly system of knowledge and principle in the world. Logos, if you will, became personified through language and perception.\nJesus is the Word because through him all things are made,\u201d says Jonathan, 8. \u201cWhat he said became. Through the words of Jesus, the Earth and man were made. So, he is the Word.\u201d \u2026 John\u2019s purpose is to establish the fact that Jesus is God and man in one person.\nAsimov describes that Logos was not interchangeable with God, but merely one power He maintained. God, being spiritual, was extracted from the rational and scientific processes of the world. Why is this important? Because I think there\u2019s a whole picture that has to connect Merma, Logos, and the Word. We have to step away from the masterpiece to notice the details in full view.\nWords construct reality. I\u2019m not saying that just because I enjoy writing. But without language, what would reality be, though? Human language has developed with the sole purpose of communicating thoughts and feelings. That\u2019s no small thing. Language is an exceedingly complex and intricate behavior and is one of the capacities that distinguish humans from the rest of the living world. Words enable humans to represent and communicate complex abstract information and tell stories.\nLook at how many creatures exist on this planet, but the gift of language is exclusively a human trait. Questions about its origin have perplexed scientists for years. Estimates of the first use of language range enormously, from as late as 50,000 years ago to as early as the beginning of the human genus more than 2 million years ago. So, what is the purpose of it? Could you imagine living a life where words of any kind never crossed your mind?\nHow well do you communicate with just your eyes or body language? Have you mastered the art of wordless communication? Speaking is essential because we have no other way of detailing how we feel efficiently. Maybe, there are a select few people who know exactly how you feel without speaking a single word. Magical connections exist in life where the frequency is so perfect that a quaint chuckle says as much as a sentence. Human beings are remarkable that way, using all five senses to get our point across, especially when illustrating to someone how much we care about them.\nLanguage and toolmaking coevolved, perhaps beginning as early as 1.75 million years ago. This doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that early humans were talking in the same rapid-fire way that we do today.\nFor taste, we can make a loved one their favorite meal. And for touch, a gentle stroke on the head after they\u2019ve had a long day. Regarding smell, we can put on a fragrance they love or, for sight, an outfit. For our sense of hearing, we can say kind things.\nWhere do you go to receive kind words? I imagine you have a person you go to when you want some external affirmation. Maybe it\u2019s a person who is indescribably kind and uplifting whenever they call you. A call from them constantly changes your day for the better. The question is: why is that feeling external? Because I believe kindness is a revolutionary act, and the most thoughtful person to you should always be yourself. There is nothing we should expect other people to give us that we are not actively giving to ourselves.\nPeople are better at communicating kindly to other people than to themselves. That\u2019s not good. How many people are the voice of wisdom and affirmation for others but lack that voice for themselves? Unless you\u2019re a miserable person, you\u2019ve never called a stranger stupid or worthless. Yet, I imagine you\u2019re hard on yourself in a way that is not productive and probably just crippling.\nNot only does language construct reality, but it also creates who we are because we became speaking subjects. Nevertheless, language is also never entirely within our power. Something about words always escapes us. There are 171,476 words in the English language. How many of those do you think you use? On average, an adult uses 20,000 words in their active vocabulary. And to be fluent in English, a non-native speaker uses 10,000 words.\nBut there are moments you can\u2019t escape with language, like when someone uses a word you\u2019ve never heard before or when another person says something that hurts your feelings. We are somewhat defenseless against language, against its forces, because those forces are constitutive of the way we come to define our experience of the world and ourselves.\nLiteracy is popularly understood as an ability to read and write in at least one method of writing, an understanding reflected by mainstream dictionaries. In this view, illiteracy would be considered to be the inability to read and write.\nUnless we control how we speak to ourselves, we will never gain control over the power of the words others throw our way. When you insult yourself in any way, you deliberately keep yourself subservient to your mind when you should become the master of your evolutionary and divine gifts. To say \u201cI love myself\u201d is to lose sensitivity toward external judgments and double down on the empathetic power of the \u201cI.\u201d\nInitially, it might feel performative when speaking kindness to yourself because it is very performative. All communication is performative. There is a vast difficulty expressing what you mean genuinely. Even when comfortable with someone, you\u2019re almost always attempting to be as accurate as possible when speaking, like an actor reading a script. Our \u201cI\u201d is the director in mind, the Self or stand-in for consciousness, who tries to ensure the actor corrects the lines. However, the least performative speech should be the one you\u2019re having with your \u201cI\u201d because what you\u2019re performing or practicing is your ability to remain open to yourself.\nWhen you degrade, curse, and slander yourself, you subordinate your wellbeing to the speech of others because you\u2019re used to hearing it. The mind is the most important real estate you\u2019ll ever own. You don\u2019t need a hostile tenant. And if you\u2019ve catastrophized your internal existence, any external catastrophe matches the rational structure of your perception. The power of countering inner hate speech stops you from repeating it to others and allows you to act responsibly in the face of language, in the space of building your reality.\nProverbs 15:4 \u201cGentle words bring life and health; a deceitful tongue crushes the spirit.\u201d Proverbs 16:24 \u201cKind words are like honey\u2013sweet to the soul and healthy for the body.\u201d Proverbs 18:4 \u201cA person\u2019s words can be life-giving water; words of true wisdom are as refreshing as a bubbling brook.\u201d\nI f you speak to yourself kindly, you will never even think negatively about anyone. Items like gossip and rumors begin to dissipate in your interests because there\u2019s no reality for those ideas to stand firm.\nAs I noted earlier, speaking to yourself in a kind manner is self-affirming. For example, think about what happens when you say, \u201cI love you\u201d to someone. The only way to ideally respond to \u201cI love you\u201d is to repeat the phrase word for word, to reiterate it back or amplify it: \u201cI love you, too,\u201d or \u201cI love you more.\u201d Like saying, \u201cI love myself,\u201d saying \u201cI love you\u201d is performative. Have you ever seen a concert or a comedy show, and the performer calls out to the city they\u2019re at to get the crowd on their side? \u201cMan, it feels good to be in Dayton, Ohio!\u201d The crowd always cheers. Most appeals to external love need affirmation, or the feedback loop breaks apart entirely.\nPerformance in our words has nothing to do with the words themselves but the potential for truth resting beneath their surface. When we say, \u201cI love you,\u201d we\u2019re trying to say, \u201cEverything I feel for you is true.\u201d If this weren\u2019t the case, then it would mean that we don\u2019t feel love for anyone until those three words leave our mouths.\nThe Birth of Venus (Italian: Nascita di Venere [\u02c8na\u0283\u0283ita di \u02c8v\u025b\u02d0nere]) is a painting by the Italian artist Sandro Botticelli, probably executed in the mid 1480s. It depicts the goddess Venus arriving at the shore after her birth, when she had emerged from the sea fully-grown (called Venus Anadyomeneand often depicted in art). The painting is in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, Italy.\nInternal love is a much more potent force than external love because to love externally is to accept being shattered, defenseless, and without narrative recreation, unless suffering exists next to it. Speaking words of love to yourself is an experience that can never result in pain.\nSo language constitutes the actual manifesting of truth in its exposure to the other forces of consciousness, the self-identifying that it is the essence of the Self that split from God at the beginning of time.\nWe deserve consideration but allow it to flow from our inner dialogue first. You deserve respect. You are important to other people for reasons you might not fully comprehend, as much as to yourself. Therefore, you, reading this, are morally responsible for speaking to yourself in a way that befits your worthiness. It would help if you talked to yourself the same way you talk to someone you value. The trade-off is that you must act in a way that makes you feel deserving of such kind speech. You can\u2019t be a mean-spirited human being and speak to yourself like a princess. That\u2019s sociopathic bullshit.\nEvery one of us misses the mark of divine behavior from time to time. If that reality meant that we should be denied kind words entirely, then I\u2019d much rather live in hell. That would not be a world I\u2019d want to live within, nor would it reflect what I believe God would\u2019ve constructed.\nTo speak kind words to yourself before anyone else means you train yourself to say the most considerate thing possible to yourself in a difficult moment. You must help yourself become a more virtuous, responsible, critically thinking entity without destroying your sense of Self. Choose your spiritual destination, but realize that it starts with defining who you are, refining your character, and articulating Self. That would put you in concert with the Word, Logos, and Memra.", "comment_count": 3, "like_count": 192, "created_time": 1645918661724, "comment": [{"user_id": "9f63b8c88331", "comment_time": 1645918661724, "comment": "Thank you for sharing!"}, {"user_id": "2f1ee383ef6f", "comment_time": 1646324400710, "comment": "This is so beautiful .

Produced by DC Films, 6th & Idaho, and Dylan Clark Productions, and distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, it is a reboot of the Batman film franchise. The film was directed by Matt Reeves, who wrote the screenplay with Peter Craig.\nRegardless of the familiarity of the cape, mask, and cowl, every portrayal of Batman is unique. Like snowflakes, no two are the same. Matt Reeves\u2019s new The Batman takes the material more seriously than other incarnations, with the darkness turned up and the humor more subtle. Environments in the film are shadowy, and the crime scenes are bloody, but it is the closest thing to a perfect Batman story that I\u2019ve ever seen any director put to screen.\nIt is blessedly not an origin story, but it dives us into Batman\u2019s career two years into crime-fighting. Of course, there is mention of the trauma that forced a young billionaire into being reclusive and fighting crime while using a bat motif, but Matt Reeves understands that most people coming to watch this movie are either smart enough to comprehend Bruce Wayne\u2019s childhood or are already familiar with it from previous iterations.\n\u201cTwo years of nights have turned me into a nocturnal animal,\u201d snarls Robert Pattinson\u2019s Batman in the film\u2019s opening narration. This opening instantly gives us two things: it introduces us to this version of the character and allows the neo-noir tone of the film to enter our minds. The film is David Fincher\u2019s Zodiac, but if a superhero solved the crime. Moreover, The Batman\u2019s focus on the particulars of gritty murders magnifies the frail nature of Gotham, where a man dressed in a bat costume and beating people up in the dead of night is relatively plausible.\nIt stars Robert Pattinson as Bruce Wayne / Batman alongside Zo\u00eb Kravitz, Paul Dano, Jeffrey Wright, John Turturro, Peter Sarsgaard, Andy Serkis, and Colin Farrell. Set after two years of fighting crime, the film sees Batman uncover corruption in Gotham City while pursuing the Riddler(Dano), a serial killer who targets Gotham\u2019s elite.\nUntil the end of the film, Reeves forgoes the superhero aspect of the character to highlight the psychology of a man who would behave as Bruce Wayne does, along with the insular brilliance it would take for a man to do it successfully. Early on, though, we get the sense that this Bruce Wayne is barely holding it together, regardless of all his brutal fighting mastery and sherlock prowess. And that gives the film a powerful catharsis.\nThe film is methodical rather than macabre, philosophical instead of pulp. For example, early in the movie, we witness a murder filled with jaw-dropping suspense. But instead of sicking the hero on the case in typical comic book film fashion, with an escalating series of action scenes, The Batman quickly sprawls outward, examining the ripples created by the initial bloodshed.\nThe Riddler, played brilliantly by Paul Dano, is much more sadistic and focused than other comic book villains. This is a villain who enjoys the show, a domestic terrorist who relishes gore and claims there is a method to his madness, and by the end of the film, the audience can see the message form.\nDevelopment began after Ben Affleck was cast as Batman in the DC Extended Universe (DCEU) in 2013. Affleck signed on to direct, produce, co-write, and star in The Batman, but had reservations about the project and dropped out. Reeves took over and reworked the story, removing the DCEU connections. He sought to explore Batman\u2019s detective side more than previous films, drawing inspiration from 1970s films and comics such as \u201cYear One\u201d (1987), The Long Halloween (1996\u201397), and Ego (2000).\nEvery actor is committed to the material in a way that oozes from director Matt Reeves. Reeve\u2019s, in my opinion, is as much the star as Dano, Pattinson, or Kravitz, as his craftsmanship shows in every single frame. Created alongside Dune cinematographer Greig Fraser, this may be the best-looking Gotham City flick of all time.\nWhile movies about police investigations often take less pleasure in the process, Reeves depicts a Batman who immerses himself in the day-to-day grind of being challenged by an antagonist. Every character in the film goes on a moralistic and sometimes spiritual journey where the ultimate destination isn\u2019t as important as the navigation.\nMatt Reeves interrogates the subconscious of these characters, imposing a magnifying glass onto their troubled interior lives. None more than Zoe Kravitz\u2019s Catwoman. He imbues this version of Selina Kyle with a grace, strength, and vulnerability that makes her more magnetic than previous iterations. It takes a lot of subtle acting to sell Catwoman\u2019s decisions, such as her superhuman ability to be at the right place at the right time while simultaneously delivering the complex person beneath the hardened exterior. Anne Hathaway did it in The Dark Knight Rises, but Kravitz brings an additional dose of humanity to the character.\nBatman is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The character was created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger, and debuted in the 27th issue of the comic book Detective Comics on March 30, 1939. In the DC Universe continuity, Batman is the alias of Bruce Wayne, a wealthy American playboy, philanthropist, and industrialist who resides in Gotham City. Batman\u2019s origin story features him swearing vengeance against criminals after witnessing the murder of his parents Thomas and Martha, a vendetta tempered with the ideal of justice\nThis is a film that I never wanted to end. I love all superhero films, but none stuck with me quite like this one. It is still rattling around my mind. It\u2019s a film that enhances Batman\u2019s cinematic legacy, complicating it by tasking the audience to examine heroism\u2019s nature and contemplate what really makes Batman a hero \u2014 or if he\u2019s even a hero at all. There\u2019s a good reason that the punisher archetype Batman created in comics has been scrutinized for ethical implications and whether or not his \u201cheroism\u201d would stand up in the real world. Reeves doesn\u2019t see that as a drawback of Bruce Wayne\u2019s character, nor does he withdraw in challenging his hero \u2014 and in doing so, revitalizes the mythology of Batman to its appropriate status.", "comment_count": 1, "like_count": 111, "created_time": 1646515481973, "comment": [{"user_id": "9f63b8c88331", "comment_time": 1646515481973, "comment": "Thank you for sharing!"}, {"user_id": "e7cf58176f8c", "comment_time": 1646566609916, "comment": "The most gritty batman we've seen"}], "post_tag": ["Comics", "Film", "Movies", "Movie Review", "Review"]}, {"author": "Rais Tuluka", "post_id": "10ef296031aa", "user_id": "9f63b8c88331", "title": "Develop Focus:", "content": "Develop Focus:\nPay Attention to What You\u2019re Paying Attention to\nStudies show that when our brain is constantly switching gears to bounce back and forth between tasks \u2014 especially when those tasks are complex and require our active attention \u2014 we become less efficient and more likely to make a mistake.\nM y hometown was 43 miles away from San Francisco, and a drive to SF felt like a vacation into another world. Crossing the Bay Bridge. Oakland, Sacramento, driving hours in any direction was better than staying in Vallejo. Something gets emphasized when we stare at our hometowns for too long. The places we come from are never perfect from our perspective.\nVallejo, California, had once been the first home of California\u2019s state government and is the 142-year home of the first and most prominent naval shipbuilding and restoration facility on the west coast. Mare Island still had massive ships docked in the bay water. One hundred twenty thousand people lived in Vallejo, isolated from anything fun or desirable. A night in Vallejo meant going to the Century 14 to watch a movie, nothing else interesting.\nStaying out of trouble was tough, especially in the summertime, when school was out and the heat boosted aggression. Fights and robberies were elevated in the hot weather. The youth in our town lived short lives. They flamed out in the summertime and took penitentiary risks before the age of seventeen. There were always young men who wouldn\u2019t make it back to school after the summer, and you heard they went either to the grave or a cell. House parties often ended in gunfire. And you didn\u2019t go out casually on a hot summer night unless you knew how to fight.\n\nI f we weren\u2019t roaming aimlessly around the city or smoking weed at a friend\u2019s house, we were at a party. Parties in the summer were stuffy. Bodies cramped in a garage, flesh to flesh. The hot air made you so tense enjoying yourself didn\u2019t cross your mind. Reckless abandon was impossible. Keep your eyes open. If everyone you came to the party with was drunk or high, one of you had to be aware \u2014 monitoring surroundings. As dramatic as it may sound, my goal when going out to these parties was to stay alive. I refused to be a casualty of summer. Bodies floated through the room around you, phantom-like, until someone familiar speaks, putting voice to form.\nIt\u2019s not even nine yet. Someone has told you that there\u2019s a problem in the party \u2014 some fonk. It only takes one time to set your antennas on high alert. Commotion starts to bubble, but you\u2019ve lost your comrades. They\u2019re dancing somewhere, but the conflict spreads over the music, drifting toward you until babble transforms into two gunshots. Pop. POP. Vague commotion becomes \u201coh, fuck,\u201d and \u201cshit, shit, shit.\u201d\nTown losers filled those parties. Older kids who wrongly felt they had nothing much to live for, so they were ready for the extreme at the slightest inconvenience.\n\nSo, you gathered your friends for escape, and you were out of luck if you didn\u2019t drive. You all were waiting in chaos until it rolled over you like a tropical storm. Never leave the people who came to the party with you. Five of you entered the hot, smelly garage together, five of you left. Sometimes, once you all heard the gunshots, you just ran like a pack of cats. Street lights didn\u2019t light anything either \u2014 poor city infrastructure. In 2008, Vallejo was the first city in the nation to file for bankruptcy.\nOnce you guys were far enough away, you just sat there and called your mom or older brother to pick you up, sweating until you cooled down. When your mom asked you guys how the party was, you told her it was great. Talk about the gunfire never leaving your mouth because if you told her the truth, she\u2019d never let you out again. Something about you enjoyed surviving the chaos with your friends. Then, in silence, you all stare out the window \u2014 smiles on your faces.\nEveryone with sense envisioned leaving Vallejo for good at some point. But how was always the question? The city offered nothing great. There were no companies to build a career at, just jobs. It wasn\u2019t a bustling city of opportunities like Los Angeles and New York. But, how many cities were Los Angeles and New York? So, unless you went away and stayed away for school, no one knew what the hell they wanted to do in Vallejo.\nEverybody had tried their hand at selling drugs. What do you expect? It wasn\u2019t even out of necessity. We were bored out of our minds, and pipelines to better futures were absent. But maybe that\u2019s not the complete truth. Many of us were all too nihilistic at such young ages, dodging conversations about what we wanted to be when we grew up like the plague. The sad truth was that working to become something just wasn\u2019t cool, no matter how many warnings we received from adults, and the kids who studied hard got ridiculed.\nAsian kids were going to college no matter what jokes we made. But those from black, latino, and even white families looked at other possibilities before seriously considering college. Upper education was too expensive to imagine without equally imagining the chance of breaking your back slaving through undergrad.\n\nRegardless of the plan, elsewhere was historically better than Vallejo. But, as I said, I wasn\u2019t alone in that sentiment. I remember everyone who left Vallejo decided to do so early in life. They just had to find their way out and find their focus.\nHuman beings are cultivated by their surroundings. Yes, certain people are more intelligent than others, which contributes to how individuals focus on an arduous task like changing their future. For every soul focused on growth and change, another doesn\u2019t care. Many people don\u2019t believe they deserve anything better than their past troubles and can\u2019t see beyond their hands. We create our reality by the strength of our focus, though.\nWhat do you love more than anything in the world? What do you genuinely want from life? You can\u2019t focus on anything unless you know where to place your focus. Learn how to motivate yourself through your focus. We\u2019ve evolved from hunters and gatherers. Creatures focused on how well and far the eyes see.\nOur eyes are focused on what\u2019s coming, constantly investigating what\u2019s worth reaching for or what to avoid. We are built to see, but we have to pay attention to see. It\u2019s almost impossible to navigate in a literal sense unless we know where to look.\nFrom a truck driver to a child in a classroom, everyone has experienced meandering attention. Our minds will wander when we rest or are in the middle of an activity. Attention allows observers to focus on essential locations (spatial awareness) or features (feature awareness) in a complex visual scene without looking at the intended object. For example, a baseball pitcher might focus his eye on home plate and distribute some of his attention to the runner at first base while also keeping track of opposing jersey colors.\nAttention is the behavioral and cognitive process of selectively concentrating on a discrete aspect of information, whether considered subjective or objective, while ignoring other perceivable information.\nAttention impacts perception while controlling vision. When a teacher shouts to their students to \u201cpay attention!\u201d what they are saying is to pay attention to where I am paying attention. Attention, and where you give it, is inherently a social endeavor.\nIn his 1890 book, The Principles of Psychology, psychologist and philosopher William James wrote that attention \u201cis the taking possession by the mind, in clear and vivid form, of one out of what may seem several simultaneously possible objects or trains of thought\u2026It implies withdrawal from some things to deal effectively with others.\u201d Think of attention as a highlighter. For example, as you read through a section of text in a book, the highlighted section stands out, causing you to focus your interest in that area.\nIt\u2019s not just about centering your focus on one particular thing; it also involves ignoring a great deal of competing information and stimuli. Focus allows you to \u201ctune out\u201d knowledge, sensations, and perceptions that are not relevant at the moment and instead focus your energy on the critical information.\u200b As a result, your mind should be a highlighter, only concentrating on bettering the things about your life.\nSince James wrote about attention in 1890, many attempts have been made to define and quantify this process more precisely while also identifying the underlying mental and neural architectures that give rise to it. The past is also rife with dissections regarding the power of attention.\nIn the Indian subcontinent, the phrase \u201cNazar lag gai\u201d is used to indicate that one has been affected by the evil eye. It is commonly believed that the evil eye can be given in the guise of a compliment, signifying its connection to the destructive power of envy (for one\u2019s wealth, beauty ecc.)\nThe eye is the bridge between internal and external reality. An open eye is symbolic of life, focus, and intelligence, and closed, of sleep and death. The wide-open eye is the sun, and in some religions, it is God. The seeing eye of man was projected into the sky and became the all-seeing omnipotence of God.\nAs early as the pyramid texts, the eyes of Horus represented the sun and the moon, his white right eye the sun, and his black left eye, the moon. In Iranian mythology, Mithra is the \u201cruler of the day sky\u201d and the \u201cwatcher of everything in the world.\u201d He is the \u201cHeavenly Light\u201d and represents heat and life. Hindu philosophy also clearly demonstrates the identification of the sun, the celestial eye. Discussing the creation of the four worlds by Brahma, Aitareya Upanishad states, \u201cEyes were separated out; from the eyes, sight; from Aditya, the sun.\u201d\nGreek mythology constructed Zeus as the \u201call-seeing eye,\u201d which ranged to \u201cinfinity, all-round about, surveying the universe.\u201d Likewise, according to Ovid, the sun is equated with \u201ceyes that behold everything.\u201d\nOur eyes, and as a byproduct, our focus, have always been essential. We\u2019ve also seen eyes with the power to harm. The eye of Medusa is murderous; that of the Etruscan war god Mars scars. Open eyes in mythology symbolize the projection of the soul\u2019s power out into the world. Half-closed, or closed eyes, symbolize pointing the soul\u2019s power inward.\nIdols in Hinduism and Buddhism show half-closed or closed eyes. In the East, it appears that sight is for insight, staring intensely into your soul instead of watching the world. When eyes are closed in the West, sleep or death usually denotes. In the East, closed eyes represent death too, but the death of the Self regarding society\u2019s expectations. The Buddhist theory is that, due to the conditions of the world, one\u2019s physical eyes may be wide open, but they only perceive darkness. And with closed eyes trained through meditation, the ability to pierce into the essence of life is possible.\nmaya, (Sanskrit: \u201cmagic\u201d or \u201cillusion\u201d) a fundamental concept in Hindu philosophy, notably in the Advaita (Nondualist) school of Vedanta. Maya originally denoted the magic power with which a god can make human beings believe in what turns out to be an illusion.\nT o Hindus, the visible world is Maya or an illusion, and the highest aim of a practitioner is to see with his spiritual eyes Samadhi, or the true essence of life. There\u2019s strength in seeing things for what they truly represent, not as we\u2019d like them to appear. Worse than that is not seeing something, and it surprises you because your focus was too narrow, not omnipotent enough. Never be willfully blind.\nPerhaps you are holding on so tight to how you would prefer things to be, and you can\u2019t see what you actually need. The sad thing about our focus is that you cannot do it well unless you discipline yourself. It takes careful observation, reflection, and education to scratch the surface of where you should be placing your focus. Everything you currently focus on has shaped your reality, a product of lengthy developmental processes, cultural, communal, and otherwise.\nYou\u2019re barely even you. You\u2019re a composite. A mixture of things you\u2019ve heard or read somewhere on social media. There\u2019s hardly an original thought in your mind. You don\u2019t even understand what you want or why you want it. But it would be best if you started focusing on what you want and why.\nDevelop focus. Focus on what is currently around you. Study when something bothers you and interrogate why it\u2019s disturbing. Focus on something within you that disrupts your sense of Self that will not bring you peace and that you can rectify. Probe, and keep probing. Ask yourself: \u201cWhat do I want to know about myself?\u201d and then ask yourself, \u201cWhat do I actually know about myself?\u201d Through focus, you can expand yourself exponentially.\nAsk yourself these questions kindly. If you don\u2019t want to get on the ground and meditate, ask yourself some questions and never stop doing it. Remember. Not only can we see what\u2019s in front of us, but we can see abstract things, too. Only human beings can envision futures and ways to be better, contrasting what is from what could be.", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 46, "created_time": 1646016760689, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Reading", "Self Improvement", "Spirituality", "Growth", "Society"]}, {"author": "Rais Tuluka", "post_id": "401fbf302653", "user_id": "9f63b8c88331", "title": "Chapter 1: Defining Peace", "content": "Chapter 1: Defining Peace\nHow Peace is Made and Lost\nWhen it comes to understanding peace as a byproduct of conflictless society, the experience involves five areas: mental, physical, structural, cultural, and existential.\nWithout proper negotiation, no definition will do peace justice. The word is too expansive, modest, loaded with nuance, and practical. In terms of mental states, peace is a penny, taken for granted unless continuously multiplied. Because what meaning does a peaceful day possess if not compared against memories of a hectic one? Yet peace is not entirely mysterious to us: we recognize it in people\u2019s words, actions, and characters. Multiple dimensions of influence coalesce whenever we demand or discuss peace. Perhaps like love or wisdom, peace is the energy we understand tacitly, instead of overtly, knowing more internally than we can easily define with language.\nAlthough examining the nature of harm and other dimensions of violence retain importance in understanding peacebuilding, it would seem that questions relating to the blurred boundaries between society, our desires, and peace require further deep thinking.\nMost of the canon surrounding peace scholarship emphasizes a nation\u2019s relationship to war. From Kant to Rousseau, this protracted canon lives as though the individual\u2019s relationship to peace is predominantly related to how a country manages its rights, along with how governments resort to violence to expand or protect their regimes. For Kant, \u201cthe crooked timber of humanity\u201d embodies a Sisyphean mission: an eternal struggle between the universal and distinct, consonance and diversity, sympathy and opposition. In the Doctrine of Right, Kant claims that \u201cperpetual peace, the ultimate goal of nations, is an unachievable idea\u201d \u2014 \u201cidea,\u201d as we will soon see through the course of this text, is the operative observation.\nBecause if peace is an idea, we all contribute to it in every waking moment, shifting its parameters through fantasy without much regard for the facts of life. And if there is cause for conflict, the facts themselves give us plenty of ammunition, not only opinions. So how can we war over truth while living in objective reality? How did we come to a society where we accept the phrase \u201cliving my truth\u201d as a part of public conversation? And how do those two questions disrupt peace from forming?\nSociety plays a part in our understanding of peace, but not to the degree that most scholarship articulates. Where nations dictate peace to their citizens, inevitable antagonisms from government expansion curse human beings to live without peace\u2019s grace. The ruling class accepts aggression and force as important articles to maintaining peace. An open expression of power and its pursuit is honorable under this mode of thinking.\nMaybe that\u2019s the case. The only reason we may know peace is through the guard rails that healthy government systems like the one enjoyed in the United States facilitate. It\u2019s a version of peace that many of us righteously plead to alter at our peril own, though. The nauseating patriarchy is an arm reaching throughout history, often pinpointed as the source of war and suffering. Yet, aspects of the oppressive patriarchy are the cornerstone of any semblance of peace we\u2019ve understood thus far in this country. In contrast to the powerful, those on the lower rungs of society embrace a peacemaking philosophy based upon the equality of individuals. However, communities, where the latter political disposition is dominant don\u2019t have more peace. Nonetheless, what remains universal is that we know peace as much from its absence as its presence, and we can discern peace from pretense.\nPeace is as assorted as we are. The word lives in our avarice and charity, genius and stupidity. We glimpse it in transient moments, sensing it and then internalizing it as an infrequent sensation that we\u2019d prefer to replicate. Nevertheless, we\u2019re able to name peace as a central component during an enduring, loving relationship when it\u2019s present. And to that same degree, not even a perfect relationship bears all the patterns of peace.\nUltimately, the more I study peace, the closer I am to being comfortable with how far modernity is from making peace a norm and how far we are to investigating its soul. Peace is desirable, but for what purpose precisely? An upset infant, wailing at the top of its lungs, knows no complex iteration of peace, nor does it care about the possibility of disturbing the peace of others. When the infant is irritated, the world will feel it. The infant doesn\u2019t have the words to describe what it desires; however, its caretakers and those who hear the crying understand that something needs to end. Peace is desirable: always within reach, yet somehow elusive. So how do we call it from the depths of our subconscious into our waking life?\nOf course, for the most part, we\u2019re speaking of two versions of peace: one is internal and the other external. Regardless, both have commonalities in that peace usually characterizes an absence of some element of strife. So as the word becomes more than a word, we demand different experiences to match personal expectations of peace. In more ways than one, we are perpetually infants, howling about to demand something in our existence changes but become deeply troubled when we don\u2019t have the language to express what needs to change and why.\nMost notions of peace are relational, meaning it\u2019s pretty challenging to determine a universal peace standard. For example, a woman sunbathing naked in her Palo Alto home\u2019s backyard might enjoy peace in that state, but she has neighbors, and her neighbors have children. What if someone sees her? True, it\u2019s her property that she has worked for, but her rendition of peace may impact others.\nIndividual attitudes of peace get homogenized into a collective whole without much effort. That Palo Alto woman might\u2019ve never even thought to try sunbathing nude in her backyard because why would that even cross her mind? This mental blocker is a natural deterrent to fostering an individual\u2019s true peaceful potential, which might be essential in uncovering peace\u2019s essence.\nWe\u2019re starting to understand that peace may be contextual. An action in one circumstance might promote peace, but it may result in conflict in another. Our relation to other human beings is our most outstanding strength and weakness. We often make concessions with family, friends, and the world, bending personal wishes to fit alongside a provided vision of propriety. The bending is altruistic. Living in a harmonious society requires us to forgo individual desires from time to time. But, the question remains, does this continued bending we do to fit within culture make us happy?\nHappiness and meaning play a vital role in establishing peace. So, I pose an overarching question that looms over this whole text: can an individual be peaceful without being happy, and can happiness be formed without meaning? We travel down the central difficulty of existence from asking that two-fold question.\nTo come to answer the questions I\u2019ve presented thus far, we return to comprehending the nature of existence itself. First, we know for sure that we were all born. The second is that we all die. The things between the start and finish of life are open for variability. The transience of existence is the frontier we all must face. In the face of death, we must figure out how to embrace life. And not just any life, but the life explicitly designed for us.\nWithout inviting too many conceptions of the afterlife, our sense of self is singular and widely distributed between various sets of processes and systems. These processes constitute personhood, consciousness, self, agency, and the multiple levels of cognition we utilize to process these multiplicities. Unless we die, all of these elements cannot be evaporated.\nImagine the kind of lives we would live if we believed our time here was not finite. Then, we would be justified in postponing everything, nothing done in the present, and everything pushed into tomorrow. Only when under the pressure of death does it make sense to act now. For if we are creatures searching for meaning, the reality of death awakens the sense of responsibility in maximizing our time here.\nIt\u2019s only fitting that I bring up Friedrich Nietzsche, who once famously said, \u201cHe who has a why can endure any how.\u201d Unintentionally, the existentialists like Nietzsche got something right concerning exploring peace. As an a priori claim, it is uncontroversial for human beings to acknowledge that we live within the confines of a material world, regardless of the multiplicities that may be violating our interpretations of said world. No being, irrespective of how they orient themselves internally, will progress toward peace unless they gain a firm footing in the objective nature of existence.\nIn some regard, the individual must ponder why they are sucking up good oxygen in the precise era they inhabit, when they theoretically could\u2019ve been born at any time in human history. Once individuals interrogate this sense of self-knowledge, they quietly fight the challenges in their lives. When a \u201cwhy\u201d is realized, every waking moment is motivated with an intensity that asks, \u201cIf I don\u2019t rise to do this one thing, then who will? And if I don\u2019t find the strength to do it now, how long will it take for me to gain the power to do it?\u201d Through this lens, life has the potential to have meaning regardless of our conditions.\nSuffering paves the pathway to peace. The human capacity to withstand anguish is a central component of being. Some of our stomachs can\u2019t tolerate too much pain, which is okay. Trust me. I\u2019m not going to say that you must withstand torture to find peace. But, and I mean this, there\u2019s merit in finding the hidden messages in disaster. It sets you free in some way. Locating meaning is integral to exploring peace, bestowing complex definitions to simple sufferings, and reimagining the narrative of life.\nAristotle grappled with the \u201chighest good,\u201d as he called it. In Nicomachean Ethics, our good friend gives us two definitions of the highest good. In one sense, Aristotle describes what we\u2019ll describe as the \u201clifestyle\u201d method, where we should structure life like a well-oiled machine. He deems human beings capable of telling what is good and reasonable for themselves. Whether or not they work toward manifesting that good is a separate debate. A good and happy life becomes a life that works well over time, like a reliable car.\nThink about it. Life is always better when you don\u2019t have to worry about taking your car to the shop. Where more times than not, you\u2019re ignorance outweighs your knowledge, and you\u2019re at risk of being duped for a few dollars. In that spirit, we can use Aristotle as a starting point for our discussion on the individual\u2019s relationship to meaning. His highest good, he contended, had three characteristics: it is desirable for itself, it is not desirable for the sake of any other good, and all other goods are in service of it.\nThe first burden of finding peace through meaning or aims is societal habits rooted in maintaining a functioning economy. If society\u2019s strictures do not agree with the specific purposes you\u2019ve set for your life, that demonstrates an obstacle to fulfillment. Of course, people need jobs, and they need to do jobs they hate to keep this ship afloat. But again, we must make from meaning and peace what they indeed are, not how they can free you from misery.\nThe second theory of Aristotle\u2019s highest good is a life dedicated to contemplation. It is the capacity to consistently process phenomena outside of oneself that gives the human-animal more meaning than others. A human being can think deeply about his peace and the nature of a dog\u2019s or a cat\u2019s, yet the reverse is not observably true. Only human beings can look at the animal kingdom and claim benevolent stewardship over it. An individual can\u2019t even come to these calls to action unless they have offered some thought on a subject. Thinking that is reserved for humanity. When a group of affluent dogs organizes themselves into creating \u201chuman shelters,\u201d I\u2019ll admit that I\u2019m wrong on this subject. But until then, it\u2019s safe to say that thinking so deep that it involves personal behaviors that benefit the peace of other species is an act solely reserved for human beings.\nSome 2,000 years after Aristotle, Viktor Frankl, the Austrian neurologist, psychiatrist, Holocaust survivor, and my idol, conveyed his experience to understand meaning. For Frankl, creating a meaningful life was about having a cause to serve or another person to love. It was about enjoying something that took you beyond yourself, which Frankl termed \u201cself-transcendence.\u201d\nFor Frankl, all good things derive from self-transcendence. However, for our uses, we\u2019ll need to understand that the more we single-mindedly strive for anything, the less likely we will achieve it; the more you focus beyond yourself, the more likely what you\u2019re seeking will meet you.\nIn Buddhism, there\u2019s a narrative called \u201cThe Parable of the Mustard Seed.\u201d It\u2019s about a woman named Gotami, who\u2019s dealing with the loss of her son. Riddled with sorrow, Gotami brings her son\u2019s dead body to her neighbors, asking if they have medicine to heal him. Everyone she encountered said the same thing: \u201cWhere did you ever meet with medicine for the dead?\u201d Finally, after Gotami\u2019s neighbors met her cries for help with sarcasm and jeers, a wise man saw her sorrow and directed her to a man known as the Sage of the Ten Forces.\nGotami proceeded to the sage, and she asked him the same question as she asked her neighbors. For medicine to help heal her son. The sage said to her: \u201cYou did well, Gotami, in coming hither for medicine. Go enter the city, make the rounds of the entire city, beginning at the beginning, and whatever house no one has ever died, from that house fetch tiny grains of mustard seed.\u201d She listened, entering the city, and at the very first house, she couldn\u2019t accept the mustard seed. Someone died in that house before.\nShe journeys to the second house and the third and fourth, but she couldn\u2019t accept a single mustard seed because someone died in every home visited. Eventually, Gotami understood the lesson the Sage of Ten Forces sent her off to learn. Overcome with emotion, she went outside of the city, carried her son to a pyre, and held him in her arms. Then, to her son, she said: \u201cDear little son, I thought that you alone had been overtaken by this thing which men call death. But you are not the only one death has overtaken. This is a law common to all humankind.\u201d Gotami then cast her son away in the burning ground. From that understanding, she learned firsthand how to make peace through acceptance of impermanence.\nI once told that parable to a student I had whose stepdad had killed his brother. After months of missing school, I asked around to see what happened to him. Quickly, details of the terrible event got back to me, and I had time to think about the kind of affirmation I wanted to share with him when he returned.\nWhen he returned, I could see he\u2019d changed. Aspects of his face had hardened. He was a wholly foreign individual, something that only tragedy can do to a person. I pulled him to the side when I saw him and embraced him. I told him that whenever he wanted to talk, I was available.\nHe tolerated my offer and came to talk with me after class that day. Everyone knew what took place, and he said he no longer felt like a human being. He had become an embodiment of the event itself because that\u2019s the first thing people would mention when they saw him. The tragedy became his identity. When he came to speak, I noticed that the bags underneath his eyes could\u2019ve held groceries.\nWe danced through small talk and dove into his incident, the tragedy, and the trauma that followed. \u201cI don\u2019t understand it,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I\u2019m doing better. I was angry at first, then I was sad, and now I\u2019m just empty.\u201d At that moment, I regaled him with the Parable of the Mustard Seed. But when I finished the parable, he just looked at me. There was no enlightenment. Just calm sat in his eyes. He stared at me and told me that he didn\u2019t care about that woman or her son or the Sage of the Ten Forces. His brother was dead. No matter how many connections I made, the parable did not resonate with him. None of it could bring him peace.\nThe phenomenologists consider meaning as being at the heart of the human experience. My student\u2019s first reaction to tragedy was confusion or even more acute than that shock. Because our minds are meaning-making engines, seeking rational connections to sort out life\u2019s randomness, we have difficulty accepting \u2014 especially with things we didn\u2019t plan to happen. However, the stark reality is that life is inherently irrational and random. There is no true meaning in why you were born to your life or look the way you do. Some powerful force delivered the minutiae of your life without your consent. Pain following the random categorizations that make up the characteristics of your life cannot be rationalized.\nAdherents to the phenomenological tradition like Heidegger and Brentano Husserl acknowledge the difficulty of separating physical existence from conscious experience and psychological processes. This tradition seeks to move our conversation surrounding life away from the domain of the obsession with appearance, penetrating deep into the world as we live it in real-time.\nAccepting life\u2019s nature for what it is holds a large portion of peace\u2019s definition. Acceptance is a foothold in peace\u2019s reins. For our purposes, we must attend to things in life from the perspective of immediacy. How are things now? Don\u2019t lie to yourself. What things in your immediate present can you alter if you\u2019re unhappy? Do you hate your life, and if you do, why? For any semblance of peace to manifest, we must analyze the things in our lives for their essence. The truth told to ourselves without kid-gloves. This practice involves the dissolution of the ontological gap between the inner and outer world, subjective and objective experience, mind, and reality.", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 50, "created_time": 1645564425771, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Society", "Politics", "Philosophy", "Life", "Life Lessons"]}, {"author": "Will", "post_id": "2d6b0d74165a", "user_id": "89de0d4bceb5", "title": "Dial Back\u200a\u2014\u200aMotion Forward", "content": "\nDial Back \u2014 Motion Forward\nA brief look into the evolution of controller ergonomics\nWhen you think of a video game controller, what\u2019s the first thing that comes to mind? Is it the first controller from your childhood? The one currently sitting on your coffee table? Maybe even one that was very unique, never having a successor inspired by its design. For most, especially those new to playing video games on consoles, it\u2019s likely influenced by a standard shape or design often seen with current-gen consoles. Two handles, rounded edges, two joysticks, an assortment of buttons on one side, triggers on the top/back, and wireless.\nOver the past few years there\u2019s been quite a lot that has changed with video games and consoles, but controllers seem to follow the same formula in terms of design (primarily Xbox and PlayStation). Even the Nintendo Switch with its separate dual controllers offers what most would consider the more \u2018standard\u2019 option to play games (via the Switch Pro controller).\nI find it interesting why ideas from years ago are seen as standard features for what\u2019s supposed to be cutting-edge technology. I\u2019d imagine a lot of faith was left in the hands of the designers and engineers behind creating controllers. For now, I\u2019m just going to take a look at some of the more notable first-party controllers from the past and will be highlighting the ergonomic and technical features they introduced. To make things simple, here\u2019s a checklist of what I\u2019m talking about:\n\nMagnavox Odyssey\nImage Source\nStarting our journey, we first encounter an odyssey: the Magnavox Odyssey. The Odyssey was released in 1972 and was the first commercially available home console. I\u2019ll admit, the first time I encountered one of these I thought it was part of a home appliance of some kind. The controllers had a basic design consisting of 4 total inputs:\n2 dials on the left (the larger dial controls horizontal movement of the player\u2019s marker/paddle while the smaller dial controls the projectile after being deflected by the player\u2019s marker)\n1 dial on the right controlling vertical movement\n1 reset button in the middle to reposition all player markers\nThe controller is generally meant to be used on a flat surface with its slightly beveled bottom and isn\u2019t ideal for holding it in your hands. The larger knobs had horizontally cut depressions for texture while the smaller knob included a protruding dial point likely for orienting one\u2019s hands without needing to look down from the screen. Because most of the Odyssey\u2019s games involved preventing a projectile from passing through a player\u2019s side of the screen (i.e., tennis), it\u2019s likely vertical movement was prioritized for the right side. As you can imagine, this was made with right-handed players in mind. Horizontal movement, though necessary for other games, was not a critical input. Interestingly, the smaller dial (or \u2018English\u2019) controls the vertical movement of the ball. Why this was a feature paired with the horizontal input is a mystery to me, but may have something to do with how the device is built.\nThe Odyssey opened the door to a foundational element important to games today \u2014 radial movement. Not only could you move on an X and Y axis, but using the vertical and horizontal knobs in tandem would produce diagonal movement. Having 360\u00b0 movement in games has been a prerequisite for controllers since its introduction via the Odyssey. Additionally, having a reset button to completely start from scratch would soon become a console-only feature for many years to come.\nAtari 2600\nImage Source\n10 years later, Atari 2600 was released in 1982 and featured what is one of the most memorable controllers ever made, the Atari CX40 joystick. This controller is an excellent example of not asking for more than what you need. Its simple design is comprised of 2 physical inputs:\n1 button\n1 digital joystick\nThe CX40 has an incredibly straightforward design and is generally intended to be used with the right hand on the joystick while the left hand holds the controller with the left thumb on the\u2026only button. The joystick has vertical ridges in a hexagon shape to help players maximize grip while the top is flat and ideal for the right thumb to sit. The button is slightly concave which can prevent thumb slippage for those really intense rounds of Asteroids. The smooth edges and wider top half make gripping the controller much easier, but can also be placed on that shag carpeting for a more arcade feel.\nAlthough it wasn\u2019t the first to introduce the concept of a handheld controller, it did pave the way for multi-direction output within 1 physical input (i.e., joysticks). The CX40 also promoted the use of a joystick dictating 360\u00b0 movement, establishing this as the optimal choice for many designs soon to follow. The CX40 also popularized the concept of having an \u2018action\u2019 button, unbound by direct labels and left up to players to discover what this single button will do in games.\nNintendo Entertainment System\nImage Source\nOnly 3 years later, the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) appeared in North America and released a widely popular controller design. For many, the NES controller was their first controller and offered an approachable design for newcomers to games. The controller\u2019s design included 8 physical inputs:\n1 Directional Pad (Up + Down + Left + Right)\n1 Select-Button\n1 Start-Button\n1 B-Button\n1 A-Button\nThe NES controller was one of the first to establish a horizontally-aligned interface and separate dedicated spaces for action and movement. Keeping things within a relatively horizontal fashion catered to the idea of making this a \u2018thumbs-only\u2019 controller (as the thumbs have greater dexterity moving horizontally than our fingers). The directional pad (D-Pad) features a slight concave design with each edge depressing towards the center bevel. Each directional input has an etched arrow indicating direction and providing texture. The D-Pad\u2019s slightly-inverted design allows for easier and faster directional change where a player\u2019s thumb can slide back to center and quickly shift to a new direction. Both Select and Start buttons are rubber textured with rounded edges and, well, look like horizontally-aligned grains of gray rice. Each is placed in the center of the controller where critical game actions (stopping gameplay or choosing menu options) are easily accessible to the player\u2019s thumbs.The B and A buttons are circular to prevent an issue seen with the earlier Famicom model where its square buttons would stick underneath the controller\u2019s body. The buttons also have a smooth, rounded top and are slightly convex.\nAlthough it isn\u2019t a novel concept, the D-Pad successfully translated the movements of a joystick (even those tricky diagonals) to a more compact, thumb-friendly physical input. The NES controller also helped establish the concept of multiple action input, which translated well with the console\u2019s library games with more elaborate functions and elements. A somewhat overlooked design choice to label buttons helped players quickly identify which action was required for several new concepts such as combinations and codes. Most of the NES\u2019s predecessors utilized a TV remote control-like design where buttons were vertically aligned. However, the NES helped firmly establish the idea of having buttons on controllers more horizontally aligned, dedicating zones for different inputs, and a great workout for the thumbs.\nSuper Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES)\nImage Source\nThe dawn of the bit wars is now upon us with the 16-bit SNES making its appearance in 1991 (2 years later than its competition the Sega Genesis). When most people think of comfortable gaming, the SNES controller is often the gold standard. The SNES controller encompasses a whopping 12 physical inputs:\n1 Directional Pad (Up + Down + Left + Right)\n1 Select Button\n1 Start Button\n4 Action Buttons (Y, X, B, A)\n2 Shoulder Buttons (L and R)\nOne of the first things you\u2019ll notice is the controller\u2019s rounded design (sometimes called the dogbone design). The controller\u2019s rounded edges conform to the middle of the player\u2019s palm and naturally guides the index fingers to the two shoulder buttons positioned at the top of the controller. The shoulder buttons slightly protrude from the controller\u2019s body, are near the same width of the controller, and are about 1.5\u201d in length. The longer buttons make for an ideal resting place for a player\u2019s fingers to sit at the ready. The bottom of the controller transitions via a 135\u00b0 angle to a straight edge where players can slightly curl their ring fingers on the apex for more stability.\nWith the inclusion of 2 additional buttons on the controller\u2019s main face, the cross pattern or diamond layout creates a natural path for the player\u2019s right thumb to easily navigate diagonally across the \u2018pairs\u2019 of buttons. Think of the pairs as being Y+B and X+A. The angled layout also complements the biomechanical thumb movement when switching between the different button pairs. The X and Y buttons are concave to help guide the more narrow tip of the thumb back to the center of the button. Additionally, the cavity serves as a unique ball-and-socket function where the player\u2019s thumb is the ball and the cavity is the socket. This allows players to easily perform simultaneous button combinations (holding Y to sprint and pressing B to jump). The B and A buttons are convex allowing the player to easily use the wider part of their thumb to locate and press the button.\nSimilar to the NES controller, the Start and Select buttons are centrally located and utilize similar shape, size, and material. However, the buttons are now at a 45\u00b0 angle, matching the YXBA button layout. The change might be due to the thumb\u2019s natural approach to the buttons where the broad side is easier to reach rather than the narrow edge (as seen with the NES controller).\nFrom the smooth contours and diamond button formation to the inclusion of shoulder buttons, the SNES controller established an excellent example of designing around the player\u2019s hands. It shaped the geography of input placement for modern controllers and illustrated that it is possible to make controllers feel more natural. Even to this day, third-party companies make reproduction models that either emulate or closely follow the SNES\u2019s overall design. Although it wasn\u2019t the first controller to feature a more rounded, mainstream \u2018dogbone\u2019 design (Sega Genesis), it certainly was the first to show the world how it\u2019s properly done.\nSony PlayStation (PS1)\nImage Source\nIn 1995, the Sony PlayStation hit the scene and catapulted the gaming world to the next generation of graphics and ergonomics. The PS1\u2019s controller originally had a simple design and relied on a D-Pad for directional input. However, 2 years after the PS1\u2019s release, the world was introduced to likely the most iconic and player-friendly video game controllers ever made \u2014 The DualShock controller. The DualShock yields a total of 19 inputs:\n2 Left Shoulder Buttons (L1 and L2)\n2 Right Shoulder Buttons (R1 and R2)\n4 Separate Directional Keys (Up, Down, Left, Right)\n1 Select Button\n1 Start Button\n1 Analog Switch Button\n4 Action Buttons ( \u20de , \u20e4 ,\u25ef, \u2715)\n2 Analog Joysticks\n2 Analog Joystick Buttons (R3 and L3)\n* It\u2019s worth noting that Sony developed an intermediate step between the original PS1 controller and DualShock called the Dual Analog Controller (sans haptic feedback), but we\u2019ll be focusing on the more popular iteration.\nAt first glance, you\u2019ll notice the DualShock has a familiar rounded shape to it *cough Dogbone* but also has a much more dynamic composition of contours. The elongated handles are angled and in a way that provides a natural path to the inputs on the left and right sides of the controller. Ultimately, this allows for the thenar eminence (where the thumb transitions to the palm) to easily rest on the controller for optimal thumb input interaction. In turn, this makes the hand form into a forehand grip and makes reaching the shoulder buttons much easier. The center of the controller is formed by a slight depression where each side of the controller\u2019s inputs are elevated from the center with a slight curb (similar to a sidewalk curb).\nThe shoulder buttons are vertically stacked and protrude from the controller\u2019s main body, leaving the top of the controller near the exact length of the shoulder buttons. This, and the slight curvature of the shoulder buttons, provides a natural guide to locating the shoulder buttons with a player\u2019s index finger without having to look down at the controller. Additionally, it promotes players to curl their index fingers on the R1/L1 buttons for a resting position, always at the ready for quick combos and aiming. One can view this as zoning where a dedicated space is established for a specific input different from the others (similar to the NES controller dedicating the left side for direction, and the right for action). The two buttons on either side are separated by about an \u215b\u201d with the R1/L1 buttons situated at the top while the R2/L2 at the bottom. The R2 and L2 buttons are slightly wider than the R1 and L1 buttons, serving as an ideal way to quickly slide the index finger down from top to bottom without overshooting it.\nThe D-Pad breaks away from the traditional unibody cross design with its individual arrow keys (a personal favorite of mine). Each directional key is in the shape of an elongated pentagon with each peak pointing towards the center space of the D-Pad formation. This allows for smooth transitions between directional change as the peak for each key provides a physical crescendo to the next and tapers to the abrupt, wide edge of the button.\nPlaced in the center are the critical in-game actions Select, Start, and Analog. The Select and Start are rectangular and triangular respectively and are horizontally aligned. It can be inferred the difference in shape is another way for players to quickly read/memorize the locations and actions via tactile memory. Below and at the midpoint between the Start and Select buttons is the rectangular Analog button which serves as a switch between activating and deactivating the joysticks. This Analog button is closest to the joysticks and at the midpoint between the two for quick activation.\nSimilar to the shoulder buttons, the joysticks have their own physical protrusion from the controller\u2019s main body. Each joystick is housed in a circular mold with a 180\u00b0 outward curvature facing the player, making the joysticks roughly separated by ~2.5\u201d-3\u201d. The joysticks have a textured rubber surface (for that non-slip grip) with an open-faced ball and socket mechanism. Although there\u2019s no obvious indication for it, the R3/L3 buttons are accessible via pressing down the left or right joystick. The key element and reason behind the name \u2018DualShock\u2019 comes from the motors located within each joystick\u2019s housing and provide haptic responses during gameplay. It wasn\u2019t the first to provide haptic feedback, but didn\u2019t require batteries and didn\u2019t rely on a single motor (where 2 motors adds a more intense and dynamic haptic response).\nAnd finally, the convex circular action buttons copy the SNES\u2019s diamond formation but deviate from the labels used. ( \u20de , \u20e4 ,\u25ef, \u2715) were originally conceived as individual actions where:\nSquare = Menus\nTriangle = Perspective or POV\nCircle = Confirmation/Yes\n\u2715 = Decline/No\nIt\u2019s easy to see why the DualShock design is still used as a reference for the majority of modern controllers and still a design PlayStation uses to this day. It gave players an excellent vessel for navigating 3D games and enabled developers more elaborate gameplay while ensuring players could still enjoy interacting with these more complex games. The biggest factor from the DualShock\u2019s contribution was prioritizing the resting position of the player\u2019s hands. With more and more buttons thrown on the controller, making every input \u2018within reach\u2019 and requiring minimal effort to memorize button placement were elements the DualShock mastered.\nFrom dials to dual wielding joysticks, there\u2019s been a lot of careful craftsmanship and research that went into these controllers we generally take for granted. It\u2019s incredible to see how a slight curve here and a bit of texture there can vastly improve how player actions are translated into gameplay \u2014 ultimately improving our sense of immersion. A one-liner to summarize the theme for the first part of our journey looking at the evolution of controller ergonomics:\nKeep the player\u2019s eyes on the game and let the thumbs/fingers do the reading.\nPart 2 will be covering even bolder and more ambitious controller designs that certainly would have been viewed as \u2018tech from the future\u2019 \u2014 starting with a Wii bit of fun.", "comment_count": 2, "like_count": 29, "created_time": 1645831183590, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Games User Research", "Ergonomics", "Game Controllers", "UX", "Answerlab"]}, {"author": "Steve Newman Writer", "post_id": "241caff8389a", "user_id": "bfbc407d814f", "title": "The Imperial Japanese Navy Sinks the Russian Fleet: Manchuria 1904/05", "content": "The Imperial Japanese Navy Sinks the Russian Fleet: Manchuria 1904/05\nThe Russian Fleet sinking \u2014 Port Arthur, Manchuria, February 1904. Image: Pinterest\nIn 1897, to gain a warm water port on the Pacific Coast Russia took control of an undefended area at the tip of the Chinese Peninsular of Liaotung in southern Manchuria, which included Port Arthur. The Chinese were in no fit state to oppose Russia, and in the end leased the area to the Russians. It would become, by 1904, a bad move.\nWhen Theodore Roosevelt, came to office in 1901, the 1899 US \u2018Open Door\u2019 policy of trade with the Far East had been slammed shut by the Russians, at which, as Roosevelt\u2019s biographer, Nathan Miller, tells us, \u201c\u2026Roosevelt privately fumed against these arrogant and treacherous moves [by the Russians], but there was little the United States could do about them\u2026\u201d, and the American people would certainly not have supported an intervention by the US Military to kick the Russians out of Manchuria.\nJapan saw things a bit differently.\nIn an age of treaties and counter treaties, and of national expansion, Russia\u2019s take-over of that small part of Manchuria worried Japan hugely; and initially Japan offered to recognise Russia\u2019s dominance in Manchuria if they, the Russians, would agree to Japan taking over Korea. Russia refused, instead demanding that a buffer zone between Russia and Japan, north of the 39th Parallel in Korea, be created. The Japanese Government refused, choosing instead to go to war.\nSince opening themselves up to the west Japan was well placed to go to war: having created a new army and, perhaps more importantly, a new navy, built with the help of the British that included the latest Class of cruisers and battleships (just two years before the Dreadnought Class), with crews trained by the Royal Navy, as part of the new entente between the two nations.\nThe new Imperial Japanese Navy, eager to show its prowess, and with Britain effectively looking the other way, attacked the Russian Eastern Fleet at Port Arthur on the 9th of February 1904.\nThe destruction of that Russian fleet was immense, as was the loss of life.\nThe Surovov sinking at the Battle of Tsushima 1905\nThe Russians never saw it coming.\nAs Nathan Miller has written:\n\u201cOver the next year, the Japanese triumphed at Mukden, where Russia lost nearly 100,000 men, and their [the Japanese] navy overwhelmed another Russian fleet at Tsushima. Roosevelt and most Americans cheered the surprising land and sea victories of the Japanese\u2026\u201d.\nThe Japanese would do it all again of course in 1941 when they attacked Pearl Harbour.\nAs a result of those naval losses in 1904/05, in both ships and men, Russia suffered revolution across vast areas of their empire: effectively a dress-rehearsal for 1917.\nBy the late 1930s the Japanese had taken over large areas of Manchuria, with great loss of civilian life.\nOh, and Theodore Roosevelt won the Nobel Peace Prize for bringing the Russo Japanese War to an end in 1906.\nThe Russian Revolution of 1905.

Image: gpb.org\nWhen Ernest and Mary arrived in Palm Beach, from Cuba, the couple picked up the Lincoln, which had been sent ahead for repairs, and started the journey northwest to Wyoming.\nIt was a glorious five days drive up through Florida, Georgia, Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, and into Wyoming, and the small town of Casper, where they booked into the Mission Motor Court. During a meal of steak and fries, washed down with a couple of beers \u2014 the best Casper could offer \u2014 Mary didn\u2019t feel too well and decided to have an early night. Ernest said goodnight, had another few beers in a local bar, played some pool with a bunch of guys who pulled his leg for looking so much like Hemingway, and then went to bed.\nEarly the following morning \u2014 around seven \u2014 as Ernest was putting some of the luggage into the car, Mary awoke in agony and began screaming for Ernest.\nThe next few hours were to be the worst of Ernest\u2019s life, and very nearly the end of Mary\u2019s.\n\u201c Can I get you some coffee, Mr Hemingway?\u201d\nIt was all the young nurse could think of saying.\n\u201c That would be good. Thank you. Thank you so much.\u201d\nJust a few hours earlier, when he\u2019d heard Mary screaming like a wounded lioness, Hemingway had dropped the suitcase he was carrying and ran back to their room where he found Mary writhing on the floor, her knees pulled up under her chin, her mouth opening and closing in anguished, uncontrollable screams of terror and agony.\nHemingway \u2014 as he had with the wounded Italian soldier back in 1918 \u2014 lifted Mary into his arms, gently placed her \u2014 still screaming \u2014 into the back of the car, and with the boot still open, roared out of the motel car park toward the hospital a half a dozen miles down the dusty road.\nTwenty minutes later he carried the now almost unconscious Mary into the Natrona County Memorial Hospital where a young intern gave her a quick examination before confirming Hemingway\u2019s own worst fears.\n\u201c I\u2019m afraid, Mr Hemingway, your wife has suffered an ectopic pregnancy and is bleeding internally. There is very little I can do. I suggest you take your final leave of her. \u201c\nHemingway exploded with rage.\n\u201c What the hell do you mean? Take my final leave? Of course there\u2019s something you can do. Get her into theatre and remove the goddam foetus.\u201d\n\u201c I\u2019m afraid I have no experience, and the resident surgeon is away today, fishing.\u201d\nHemingway\u2019s rage suddenly drained away, then put his arm around the young intern\u2019s shoulder in a fatherly fashion.\n\u201c Well, son, you, me, and the old man will have to do it. Death is not an option, do you understand, not an option?\u201d\n\u201c But your wife has already lost consciousness, most of her veins have collapsed, and her pulse has virtually faded.\u201d\n\u201c There\u2019s no time to waste then, is there.\u201d\nWearing a gown and mask, and with his doctor father whispering instructions over his shoulder, Hemingway found one good vein in Mary\u2019s arm, inserted a needle to which he connected the feed tube of a bottle of plasma and waited. Gradually Mary\u2019s pulse returned to normal, and just as Hemingway and the intern are about to administer a general anaesthetic and commence surgery, the resident surgeon, smelling of fish, returned and took over.\nWhen the young nurse came back with the coffee she found Hemingway in the car park.\n\u201c Coffee. \u201d\n\u201c Thanks.\u201d\n\u201c That was a wonderful thing you did, Mr Hemingway.\u201d\n\u201c I shall go and see her when I\u2019ve finished my coffee.\u201d\nAfter drinking his coffee the pain in his head gradually eased, as did the shaking in his limbs. Slowly he began to feel almost normal, almost.\n\u201c I am so pleased that your wife did not die.\u201d\n\u201c Me too. Me too.\u201d\nA few minutes later Hemingway, sitting at Mary\u2019s bedside, is holding her hand. Mary keeps slipping in and out of consciousness, and when she speaks she does so very quietly, and with effort.\n\u201c Sorry, Hem.\u201d\n\u201c Sorry? What for, honey?\u201d\n\u201c Losing the baby.\u201d Mary starts to cry.\n\u201c Don\u2019t be, honey.\u201d\n\u201c Do you know, my father used to take me on the Northland, that was his steamboat, and stand me on a box so I could take hold of the wheel, and when we passed Sugar Point, where the last battle between the Chippewa and the US Army was fought, he\u2019d let me pull the steam whistle cord and I\u2019d let out a couple of real blasts. It was a fine boat and my father used to steam around Leech Lake, in Minnesota, picking up lumber and ferrying the workers back and forth to the different lumber camps. When I was small they were a mix of European immigrants and young Chippewa mainly, with the odd Canadian or two, and they got on pretty well most of the time. On pay days there\u2019d be a few fights, but nothing too serious.\u201d\n\u201c Sounds like a John Wayne movie to me.\u201d\n\u201c It does not, Hem!\u201d\n\u201c Sorry, honey.\u201d\n\u201c Like I said, my father\u2019s customers were mostly lumbermen, and his cargo lumber and cutting equipment. In the end he went into the lumber business too, and did pretty well. We ended up with a farm, and a good acreage of forest, and still kept the boat in business. The pilothouse, on the top deck, was my summertime world. It had a bare board floor, and from the height of my father\u2019s waist upwards it was enclosed in glass, and I often remember seeing him alone in there steering the boat and singing Gilbert and Sullivan, usually the tit willow song. Do you remember how it goes, Hem?\u201d\n\u201c Me? I haven\u2019t sung G and S in years, not since mother made me sing it with grandpa.\u201d\n\u201c Sing it to me, Hem.\u201d\n\u201c I can\u2019t sing, and sure as hell not in a hospital\u2026\u201d\n\u201c Hem, please sing it to me.\u201d\nHemingway, hearing the pleading tone in Mary\u2019s voice, clears his throat and sings, hesitantly at first, but then with growing confidence.\nOn a tree by a river a little tom-tit\nSang willow, tit willow, tit willow!\nAnd I said to him Dicky bird\nWhy do you sit, singing:\nWillow, tit willow, tit willow?\nIs it weakness of intellect, birdy? I cried,\nOr a rather tough worm\nIn your little inside?\nWith a shake of his poor little head,\nHe replied,\nOh willow, tit willow, tit willow!\nHe slapped at his chest, as he sat on that bough,\nSinging, willow, tit willow, tit willow!\nAnd a cold perspiration bespangled his brow,\nOh willow, tit willow, tit willow!\nHe sobbed and he sighed, and a gurgle he gave,\nThen he plunged himself into the billowing wave,\nAnd an echo arose from the suicide\u2019s grave -\nOh willow, tit willow, tit willow!\nNow I feel just as sure as I\u2019m sure that my name\nIsn\u2019t willow, tit willow, tit willow.\nThat twas blighted affection\nThat made him exclaim,\nOh willow, tit willow, tit willow.\nAnd if you remain callous and obdurate, I\nShall perish as he did,\nAnd you will know why,\nThough I probably shall not exclaim as I die,\nOh willow, tit willow, tit willow!\u2026\nThere is a small ripple of applause behind Hemingway from the young nurse and doctor, and an elderly male patient. Hemingway smiles, taking a very histrionic bow.\n\u201c Thank you, thank you.\u201d\n\u201c Your mother, had she been here, would have been very proud of you.\u201d\n\u201c Do you think so, Mary ? \u201d\n\u201c Yes, I do.\u201d\n\u201c Let\u2019s all be thankful she\u2019s not then.\u201d\n\u201c Oh, Hem.\u201d\n\u201c Honey, I think they want to put the tent up.\u201d\n\u201c I remember he once gave me some good advice.\u201d\n\u201c Who? \u201d\n\u201c My father, Captain Thomas Welsh, that\u2019s who.\u201d\n\u201c And what was the advice? \u201c\n\u201c He told me never to be a sheep. Never follow a leader only because he is ahead of you. Take time to look around and see for yourself if you are going in the right direction. I must have been all of eight or nine years old at the time. I\u2019ve never forgotten that, Hem.\u201d\n\u201c Good advice. Now will you allow these good people to do their work, and then please get some sleep?\u201d\nHemingway kisses Mary on the mouth and leaves the room.\n\u201c Hem?\u201d\n\u201c Yes, sweetheart? \u201d\n\u201c Thanks for saving my life.\u201d\n\u201c Anytime.\u201d\nImage: The Guardian\nRead: Hemingway and Mary are Married\nNote: Although based on fact I have used a certain element of creative licence.\nBibliography:\nCarlos Baker \u2014 Ernest Hemingway: A Life Story (Wm.

Image: The Times\nThe Revolt in the Desert was written by T. E. Lawrence, and first published by Jonathan Cape in 1927, and as I\u2019ve written previously the book is:\n\u2026 actually a shortened version of Lawrence\u2019s masterpiece, The Seven Pillars of Wisdom, which is a detailed and very personal account of Lawrence\u2019s exploits in Arabia fighting the Turks from 1916, with, at first, a small guerrilla force of tribal fighters that struck the Turkish forces as and when it chose, creating chaos and fear. Their success, and the military leadership that Lawrence showed, resulted in his campaign, that included the capture of Akaba, becoming a major part of the larger Middle East strategy, which led to the capture of Damascus, and the defeat of the Turkish forces.\nIt has always been a controversial book, with many questioning the accuracy of the military detail, forgetting that the book is much more than a military re-telling of what was considered by many to be a \u201c side show of a side show\u201d, but a book that tells a very different story about personal endeavour, endurance, and sheer will-power, and a political will to bring disparate groups of people together to fight an enemy, and make cultural and political changes.\nT.E. Lawrence was a multi-faceted character with mixed parentage. He was an accomplished archaeologist and an intellectual of the first order. He was also tough as old boots, yet gentle; had an iron will and was brave beyond bravery. He was also something of a chameleon who spoke many languages, and many Arabic dialects. He lied when it suited him, but then that\u2019s often what writers, politicians and soldiers have to do.\nHe was also a writer with a gift for both poetic and clipped prose that has undoubtedly been an influence on literature of all genres.\nRevolt in the Desert, first published in 1927, is a book of 318 pages, whereas Seven Pillars of Wisdom, first published commercially in 1935, is a book of 660 much larger pages.\nImage of Revolt in the Desert: Jonathan Cape/ebay\nRevolt in the Desert was originally intended by Lawrence for the US market (as a means of trying to keep it away from British readers) and although the US publisher, Frank N. Doubleday, liked the idea when it was presented to him by Lawrence he was not convinced of its commercial value.\nFlorence Doubleday (n\u00e9e Van Wyck), the widow of Frank Doubleday, has written:\n\u201cWhen we came to London in December 1918, Sir Evelyn Wrench [1882\u20131966, journalist and editor of The Spectator] invited my husband, F. N. Doubleday, (known to his friends as \u2018Effendi\u2019) to a dinner, at which he was placed by the side of a young, blond gentleman in khaki; on his place card was \u2018Colonel Lawrence\u2019. My husband had a delightful time at dinner and, when it was over, he said: \u2018I am so sorry that we shall not see you again.\u2019 Lawrence replied, \u2018Why not?\u2019 My husband said, \u2018 Because I am just passing through London.\u2019 Lawrence said, \u2018Aren\u2019t you staying at an hotel?\u2019 And the answer was: \u2018Yes, Brown\u2019s. Will you come and dine with us if Mrs. Doubleday writes and invites you?\u2019 \u2018With pleasure,\u2019 replied Lawrence.\u201d\nFlorence Doubleday. Image: Find a Grave/Dave Francis\nThat was Lawrence at his pushy best.\nWhen Lawrence left that dinner Frank Doubleday asked Evelyn Wrench who the young man was, to be told it was Lawrence of Arabia, one of the most sought after men in London, and that he must surely know about his exploits in Arabia which the American journalist, Lowell Thomas \u201c\u2026is exploiting in every way which may assist Lawrence in his cause for Arabia.\u201d\nFrank N. Doubleday. Image: wikipedia/ Floyd Campbell\nDoubleday was intrigued and the following morning went to see Rudyard Kipling, who was also staying at Brown\u2019s, and asked if he and his wife would like to dine with him and Florence, and T.E. Lawrence, the next Friday. Kipling said that he already had a dinner appointment on Friday but would gladly cancel to meet Lawrence.\nOn the Thursday evening the Doubledays, after an early dinner, were leaving the hotel dining room when Lawrence appeared, and before they could comment he said, enquiringly:\n\u201cBut you asked me for dinner to-night.\u201d\nThere was a pause.\n\u201cOf course, yes, with pleasure.\u201d replied the Doubledays, leading Lawrence back into the dining room.\nFlorence writes of the evening:\n\u201cAfter dinner we went up to our sitting-room and had an enchanting evening. He was full of his Arabian campaign at that time and had some hope that he was going to get Damascus for the Arabs\u2026\u201d; which sounds very much like a pitch for a book to me, and very different from his later diffidence when asked about Arabia. But Doubleday did eventually become Lawrence\u2019s publisher in the US, and a lasting friend, as would his wife. I feel that Rudyard Kipling must have been very disappointed not to have met Lawrence.\nInterestingly Lawrence writes, in a 1930 letter to Doubleday that he flew over Kipling\u2019s garden when flying back (he was in the RAF at that time) from Folkestone to Plymouth, and \u201c\u2026We tilted the Moth up on one wing-tip and spun round and round over his garden. I wonder what he said: and can guess it nearly.\u201d\nKipling at about the time of the meeting that never was. Image: ThoughtCo\nLawrence was always in a quandary when it came to the publication of Seven Pillars of Wisdom, especially after his own 1922 self-publishing efforts at what has been called a \u2018sumptuously produced book\u2019 printed by the Oxford Times presses, but one that might only, because of its price of 30 guineas (\u00a32,000 in today\u2019s values), be bought by the wealthy (George Bernard Shaw returned his copy with corrected punctuation) which would certainly not cover the cost of printing. And as Helen Smith writes in her biography of Edward Garnett, Cape\u2019s chief editor:\n\u201cThe lavishness of the book\u2019s production had landed Lawrence in debt and so he set about producing a popular abridgement himself in the hope that it would alleviate his financial predicament. The resulting book, Revolt in the Desert\u2026was an immediate bestseller, and Cape\u2019s profits for 1927 rose from around \u00a32,000 to nearly \u00a328,000\u2026\u201d.\nAs Lawrence biographer, Desmond Stewart, reminds us, Lawrence always thought Revolt in the Desert to be little more than a pot-boiler, which is a bit mendacious to say the least. Lawrence\u2019s book is a good first look at the Arabian Campaign, which should whet the appetite of any reader with an interest in the man.\nLawrence in Arabia.

We were standing in line at the Fortino\u2019s hot food counter, and my friend said she was ordering some \u201cperogies.\u201d I smiled and nodded, not knowing what she was talking about. Considering the Polish version of the word, I find it surprising that I never registered the cross-over until then. I never intentionally thought about being Ukrainian until both my Baba and Gido passed away. Gido died ten years ago, and my Baba only 2. I\u2019ve been realizing more and more that part of my Ukrainian identity has become a choice: I can choose to carry it on through rituals of my orchestration or leave it behind. I feel my privilege in having been able to hold onto even small parts of my culture so casually the majority of my life. Only now have I been feeling the slightest weight of colonialism offering me a cloth to wipe it away.\nMy Gido came here from Ukraine when he was about five years old. My Baba told me that Dziadziu (jah-jo) was asked to fight for Nazi Germany, and he refused, so as a result, they were put into a concentration camp. Babcia (bab-chya), Dziadziu, and Gido escaped and came to Nova Scotia first, then to Hamilton, where they settled.\nI don\u2019t remember Gido talking about his family or Ukraine, though there were reminders in some photos and decorations throughout the house. My mom and her siblings went to Ukrainian school as children, and we were semi-regulars at the Ukrainian Church. Still, besides certain words, foods, and holiday traditions, our family\u2019s history in Ukraine is a big question mark to me. My mom was the one to tell us now and then through her story-telling that all Gido said he remembered was long train tracks and walking for what felt like forever.\nWe regularly practiced Saturday night dinners at Baba and Gido\u2019s. Gido was the glue to our family. Whatever inter-personal conflicts existed between aunts and uncles were at bay in their household. When my Gido died suddenly of an aneurysm in 2012, I should have expected that our family would have to think about how we were going to hold ourselves together and, additionally, how we would hold onto certain practices that we only performed in that house.\nOther than some arthritis, my Gido was perfectly healthy by socially accepted standards. He worked out regularly, worked full-time, and was the primary caretaker to my Baba, who was diagnosed with MS early on in her life. He loved to take us toy shopping and make us deruny (potato pancakes) on the weekends. When my mom called me one afternoon to tell me something was wrong, I thought it was about my Baba.\nPiecing history together\nMy Gido was extraordinarily loving and incredibly hard-working. He had a book collection that could compete with the library and an ever-growing movie and music collection. There was always music playing in their house, and there was always food. When we would spend the night, we\u2019d fall asleep to the sound of a movie playing loudly in the next room. The classical radio station reminds me of him. He would blast Bach as he drove us around town at what felt like lightning speeds as if we were part of a car chase and he was conducting the score. Looking back now, being close to 30, I think about how cathartic loud music can feel. How often, when I\u2019m driving, music helps distract my thoughts. There\u2019s so much about my Gido I\u2019ll never get to know. It\u2019s even worth noting he died on February 29, a day that doesn\u2019t happen most years. Interrogating this blurry in-between is what I\u2019ve been learning to sink into.\nIn studying Social Services, I\u2019ve learned a lot about childhood development and how impactful the years between age 0 and 7 are for so many aspects of a person\u2019s being. My Gido was gone so quickly and without warning. I wonder where his childhood memories and feelings sat in his body of 71 years. Hungarian-Canadian physician, Gabor Mat\u00e9, says that childhood trauma can instill a sense of never being good enough in someone. People build up habits of working too hard to prove that they\u2019re worthwhile. He explains he got this message as a Jewish infant under the Nazis during WWII. He got the message that the world didn\u2019t want him, that he wasn\u2019t good enough. He became a workaholic doctor. I think about how busy my Gido kept himself, also a doctor. I think about how busy my mom keeps herself. I think about how busy I keep myself.\nPutin\u2019s take on the history of Ukraine, Russia, and thoughts on the US, is another reminder of how war mentality has never really ended. What\u2019s further illuminating is Ukrainian authority denying African and Asian nationals access to safety. This chess game to gain power is fought every day by our leaders through capitalism, oppression, colonialism, and white supremacy in one way or another. It\u2019s always on these powers\u2019 minds, the means they use are the only things that change. We are all the pawns. Authorities disguise themselves by co-opting words like allyship and diplomacy. These disguises can throw us off, making us wonder who we can trust, especially when we hear of sudden, specific tragedies or injustices in mainstream media. These leaders also like to convince us that events happen in isolation so they can get away with attempting to treat them in isolation. All actions come with roots and reactions, and most certainly, actions occurring on a global scale.\nThe war on social media\nResearcher Scott Timcke talks about the fact that there is no common experience of social media, how each of our unique algorithms cushions our understanding of events and news. He says,\n\u201cMy way of understanding a tweet is shaped by the tweets that happen to be around it\u2026 What am I reading around an issue or what are the other people commenting upon it?\u201d\nOur lives are shaped by who and what surrounds us, and online, that\u2019s explicitly curated to our liking. We don\u2019t have to deal with contesting opinions as much. We can unfollow, mute, and ignore the discomfort altogether. We can log off instead of working through conflict. This control is helpful when we need a good break. Still, on the whole, it becomes dangerous when we start to think that we could build a separate life that suits our needs and our needs alone. Social media is tailored validation, a place where we find the collapse of context, nuance, and complexity. It fits just right, so long as you stay inside your echo chamber. Algorithms at their most intense are the pinnacle of individualization. Things become black and white, and we start to think in extremes and binaries.\nLife would be so much simpler if things were clear-cut. Boundaries would be easier to set, and we\u2019d have more control. Relationships are never as clear-cut as we want them to be, and they are usually more about choice than we\u2019d like them to be. The complexity in which the world operates needs a type of involved, critical participation that we are not well equipped to deal with. I sometimes wish most things were about the content that leaders try and convince us of and that I could accept them at face value. Nothing is as it \u201cnaturally appears\u201d online. Algorithms have been described as \u201cempathetic\u201d to this war, calling attention to the lack of empathy (i.e. racism) coding has to genocides, tragedies, and violence going on globally elsewhere, particularly the Middle East and African nations. I\u2019m trying to wrap my head around the use of the word empathetic to the construction of algorithms as if they are their own being, as if we don\u2019t participate in the process. To challenge this, I offer that our relationship to social media is another which might be more about choice than we\u2019d like it to be too. We have to put in a bit more work to try and figure out what is actually going on and even still, we might not fully know.\nBeing critically participatory is essential yet can feel impossible due to how overwhelming and messy it is, and how tempting it is to want simplicity. I\u2019m also thinking about the pandemic and the buildup around its \u201cending.\u201d We know the impact of COVID will not be over once the mandates change or the reporting stops.\nIntergenerational-trauma\nThere are very few things in this world with firm beginnings and endings \u2014 perhaps a sports game, a song, feature film, but most things never truly end. Despite declarations, most experiences live on in the bodies that survive them. Ignoring this is to accept that heightened diseases, heart failure, and stress-induced illnesses are inevitable in certain bodies instead of something that we could care for if we were willing to. It is to live in ignorance of the dire need to shift our society\u2019s care systems. You can only unfollow or mute so many people; sooner or later, you will have to step outside. What do we reach to when we can\u2019t mute someone IRL? A weapon? We think we\u2019ve come so far from our ancestors, and that may be true in some regards, but we still have so much further to go. We are not binary beings, nor are our experiences linear. Sitting in this complexity forces a sort of maturity that allows you to do something that feels next to impossible otherwise: accept. Accept that we are in a place needing to address the repercussions of history and our actions before moving forward with our lives. It\u2019s tough to care for what you refuse to believe is there.\nTo think that all of this escalated while Ukrainians were still sleeping, that so many woke to attacks. To think about how much of the Western world was watching as bystanders. To think about all the times we\u2019ve been bystanders. To think about the specific motivations behind when we deem it appropriate to step in. Ukrainian anxiety rose with the sun. We watched the war \u201cstarting.\u201d We watched the cloth of war doing what it does best: working to erase and further instill a sense of unworthiness in yet another generation of people.\nAn expansive timeline for healing\nYou could place your ancestry on a timeline to avoid the question marks or context. My Gido\u2019s life: 1941\u20132012, but where does that leave me? The times I\u2019ve tried to ignore the history that\u2019s made me, I end up with a version of myself that feels so utterly disconnected and individualistic \u2013lonely. In accepting the interconnectedness of relationships and history, I think that my Dziadziu\u2019s refusal to fight for Nazi Germany is the part of me that shows up for the community and dreams of a better world, the part of me that knows actions speak louder than words, even if it means living a harder life with my loved ones. I want to believe that my Gido\u2019s trauma shows up in my practicing having a bigger heart to care for those around me. I play classical music and think about him, thankful that we never lose anyone completely. I am grateful for those who came before me who live on through me. I think about the responsibility I feel to them, noting the privilege we had in even being able to escape. I feel the responsibility to do better in the ways I can and to still acknowledge the harm that has come and that is still coming from my ancestry. I hope that their trauma is in part healing through me two generations later. If I ever have children, I hope all of this work means that they will inherit the feeling of being enough.\nIn conversation with Kamea Chayne on Green Dreamer, Shilpa Jain shared a familiar quote: \u201churt people hurt people\u201d and mentioned she heard someone add, \u201cthen they then build institutions that hurt people.\u201d Conversely, Shilpa says, \u201chealing people are healing people, and create systems that are healing people.\u201d She also importantly recognized how these systems are operating almost all of the time. At any moment, she says, \u201cI might be the one hurting or hurt, or healing, or supporting the healing.\u201d\nShe applies this while thinking through colonization,\n\u201c I know that in order to colonize, a person has to be separated first from themselves, and from the earth, from their own humanity\u2026 What I\u2019ve learned over time is that we have to make space for even hurt and pain. People want to have that acknowledged. When we acknowledge it, it can flow out of us, instead of being stuck. We\u2019re just constantly defining ourselves against what didn\u2019t work, against our own pain, against the thing that was wrong, instead of looking towards what we want to grow, and engaging with that creative energy.\u201d\nPerhaps if we could expand the ways we help each other heal from places of acceptance, we could stomach complexity and pain because we would know of the possibilities to transform them and move from them. Perhaps we could innovate from that place, and find possibilities for different futures there too.\nBaba and Gido\nAn Injustice!\nA new intersectional publication, geared towards voices, values, and identities!aninjusticemag.com", "comment_count": 1, "like_count": 59, "created_time": 1646008516606, "comment": [{"user_id": "e75b45a4573f", "comment_time": 1646008516606, "comment": "Thank you for sharing!"}, {"user_id": "86e5c412eee", "comment_time": 1649089620017, "comment": "\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d"}], "post_tag": ["Trauma", "Relationships", "Family", "History", "Culture"]}, {"author": "Katherine Sullivan", "post_id": "6c2bdb3ddd07", "user_id": "e75b45a4573f", "title": "Platonic Intimacy: The Beauty And The Challenges of Loving People", "content": "Platonic Intimacy: The Beauty And The Challenges of Loving People\nWhat bell hooks and Joan Didion taught me about sharing expansive, queer love with more than just our romantic partners\nPhoto by Niv Shimshon\nThe night before Joan Didion died I was sitting on my friend\u2019s couch (house-sitting) watching the Didion documentary, The Center Will Not Hold. I\u2019ve seen the film what feels like dozens of times but still had an overly emotional reaction. I wasn\u2019t expecting it, but it was relieving; I needed it.\nI was thinking about how much time I\u2019ve spent in my apartment over the last two years and how our homes adapt to us and hold us; I\u2019ve grown so comfortable there. Sitting in my friend\u2019s place, I felt I was without the same protection. No shields exist that know the shape of my tears. The air of anonymity in the room allowed me a clean slate to let go.\nAfter the movie ended, I began to think this yearning to let go, in part, was the reason I came in the first place, why I decided to stay longer than to simply water the plants.\nWhat does letting go mean?\nI feel like I have been searching for ways to let go all year, and failed attempts have been making me wonder what it is I\u2019m even looking for. Can we ever really let anything go? Or do we rather accept, compartmentalize, and move forward with our lives? Or is that the same thing?\nFor context, what initially triggered this pointed reflection was an argument with a close, close friend. This is the only person I argue with, and every three months or so gravity takes hold of us and pulls us into the same dance. It\u2019s usually my feelings that are hurt from what I feel are important moments where they act without care or thought for our friendship.\nIn interrogating the root of my upset, I found us coming up against old rhetoric that circulates connection, relationships, and boundaries. They said I was acting like a \u201cgirlfriend.\u201d I felt like I wasn\u2019t being seen clearly. I felt frustrated that the only way for us to become closer seemed to be deemed \u201cgirlfriend territory\u201d and that there was a distinct and separate place for friendship that has limits.\nI started to think about all the times with my friend I\u2019ve shown up with my heart on the table thinking his was there too. Over the years we\u2019ve gotten closer to each other but I\u2019m now seeing the window between us. My nose is pressed up against the glass and I can see his heart beating but I can\u2019t get to it. In this awareness I\u2019ve been wondering just how much I have to let go of for us to be able to move forward.\nPhoto by Niv Shimshon\nThe other side of the coin\nI\u2019ve realized that many people move through the world genuinely believing it\u2019s your job and your job alone to take care of yourself. Many people believe your friendships are there to keep you company, and your partner is the one person who will go the extra mile and care for you, the one who will open up with you.\nThe purpose of this essay is not to criticize. It\u2019s to figure out where that leaves those of us who view all of our connections as closely woven partners when we end up in friendships with the ones who will only allow themselves to care deeply in romantic contexts.\nThere is a particular point where these friends will leave you on your own in the wilderness, tending to a garden you started together. How much do you give at that point, and what should you expect in return? How much of this is healthy growth, and what is hurt for the sake of martyrdom or teaching someone else a new way to love?\nWhen you commit to loving others, you can only commit for yourself, and you never know when someone might leave, disappoint, or pause in their depth while you keep diving. Maybe that\u2019s why people like the idea of marriage or reserving this risk for one \u201cpartner\u201d; it\u2019s some semblance of control over what both parties are committed to. However, as we know, even writing our intentions down on paper and signing them off doesn\u2019t always make them last, or does it mean they\u2019ll meet our ideals for something as long and as unknowable as forever.\nWhat loss has to do with it\nMy friend brings up the heaviness with which I navigate the world often; they tell me to lighten up when I get my feelings hurt, they tell me life is not that heavy.\nDidion shared with us an observation about her own heaviness in On Keeping A Notebook. She says for herself that notebook keepers are born with a \u201cpresentiment of loss.\u201d I relate to this not only from keeping notebooks my whole life but also in a queer way. Queer people attend a million funerals for their former selves; we are well acquainted with loss. Different losses have intensified a specific attachment I have, or perhaps obsession with, collecting and keeping the memories and feelings I don\u2019t have to let go of, alive. It\u2019s a deep passion, appreciation, and presence with the people you can fully be yourself around, because you know how rare that is to find.\nIt\u2019s a bit like He Zhiwu\u2019s spirit in Chungking Express,\n\u201cIf memories could be canned, would they also have expiry dates?\u201d\nAnd his hopeless romanticism,\n\u201cIf so, I hope they last for centuries.\u201d\nAttachment grows tenfold when faced with endings or with the death of loved ones who you know you\u2019ll never get back. In those cases the memories that remain are all you have left. Your next moves become all the more important; what do you preserve? Inevitably, you will have to let some go.\nIn my life now I feel like I\u2019m holding a magnifying glass to my current inventory of relationships. Finding out that one, voluntarily, doesn\u2019t want to be taken off the shelf is especially hard after you\u2019ve already opened up to them. It\u2019s like attending a tiny funeral for everything that could have been. What is the new hope for your relationship together? How long do you keep your nose on the glass, hoping they change their mind?\nAfter repeatedly having conversations within this relationship to figure out a way of friendship that works for both of us, I\u2019m starting to feel the hard limits of communication.\nPhoto by Niv Shimshon\nWhen language fails us\nI\u2019ve been pondering an Annie Dilliard quote from Pilgrim at Tinker Creek around language. That \u201cseeing is very much a matter of verbalization\u201d and that \u201call those things for which we have no words are lost.\u201d\nWhat came to mind alongside this is what poet Erica Lewis writes,\n\u201cYou can\u2019t heal a wound with logic.\u201d\nThere was a point in my friend and I\u2019s argument where they asked me, \u201cbut what does that feel like?\u201d In trying to explain where our differences hurt me, I came back for air, exhausted. Both of us were no closer to each other. I think that there are no adequate words for healing these types of wounds or patching up where we lack connection, not without one of us changing, fundamentally.\nThe pressure we put on language alone to accurately communicate ourselves confronts the restricting nature of language. Of course there are ways of communicating that bring us closer, but words by themselves can lead us down a dangerous rabbit hole when we overestimate their power for healing. Words communicate, actions and feelings heal. Even in writing this essay, I know I\u2019m only getting an inch closer to whatever it is I\u2019m processing. I know the hard part will be feeling it all. The fact that I think a perfect description could be the bulk of work to examine my feelings or my experiences is hoping for a get out of jail free card; it\u2019s a self-curated illusion that I\u2019m moving forward when really I\u2019m buying time. Some arguments can feel a lot like buying time.\nTo not have words is to not have control (maddening for a writer.) Being speechless is vulnerable and exposes that we don\u2019t actually know what is coming next. It requires a white flag, a surrendering to our feelings and bodies. I think this is partly why talking it out hasn\u2019t been the answer for my friend and I. To wander into the unknown with another person cannot be defined or controlled. I can\u2019t promise that by opening up the window my friend won\u2019t be hurt, but I can promise that they\u2019ll be loved.\nThe things we don\u2019t have words for are not lost, but you have to be brave enough to find and hold them in your heart, and many aren\u2019t looking to do that in *just* a friendship.\nPema Ch\u00f6dr\u00f6n writes,\n\u201cCould we see, hear, feel other people as they really are? It is powerful to practice in this way, because we\u2019ll find ourselves continually rushing around to try and feel secure again.\u201d\nMore and more I\u2019m trying to show up for the people I love without any answers or assumptions. I feel insecure, unsure, and raw, but I don\u2019t see there being an alternative route if I want deep, true relationships.\nThe expansiveness of queer love\nIn exploring my queerness, I feel like I\u2019ve been growing into what my heart has always known. I\u2019ve had to let go of a certainty I was under the impression I once had and instead trust my feelings more than anything else. I\u2019ve had to interrogate what ideals led me so far away from myself for most of my life and put them to rest.\nbell hooks said,\n\u201cI might have an ideal in my mind of who it is I could partner with and life might bring me completely someone that does not meet that ideal but that is loving. And then that\u2019s the challenge: will I choose to love or will I stay attached to my ideal in some way that keeps that love from me? \u2026 The more important place in our lives is who we connect with and who we find we can love, and we don\u2019t always connect with the people who are just like us.\u201d\nAn ideal that I find many romanticize is a waiting game. Waiting for someone who meets all of these checkboxes, waiting to know it will be worth it to open up. But from where I am standing, all I can see are the glitches in the game. I\u2019ve observed that those who live this way, whether they are conscious of it or not, find friends who follow the same rules: everyone keeps each other at a careful arm\u2019s length apart. They don\u2019t bring up what they know will rock the boat, and each has a life jacket on hand so that if the ship sinks, they\u2019ll be able to swim away (each person for themselves.) They have a hands-off approach; things change, and we can\u2019t do anything about it. I wonder if at any point they will experience a loss that makes them grasp for feelings and memories left in the way I do. If that does happen, I wonder if they\u2019ll wish they broke their rules to hug each other more. Inevitably, memories become distant, but they should not start there.\nNow it\u2019s not to say that the grass is necessarily \u201cgreener\u201d on my side of the fence. It\u2019s hard to love friends in the way I try to, dismantling what our society teaches us about love. I\u2019ve consistently reached points in relationships with my heart open, only to find friends ready to throw in the towel. I expect too much; I am too sensitive. A commitment to valuing relationships doesn\u2019t mean less conflict, or that when people open up, it will be with truths I\u2019m ready and happy to hear that complement mine. I know with honesty comes challenge and growth, and sometimes it means taking a look at myself in the mirror and not liking what I see, but I\u2019m committed to loving through those moments. I\u2019m also not interested in the alternative: in building rooms without any mirrors.\nPhoto by Niv Shimshon\nWhat I\u2019m really scared of\nDidion wrote,\n\u201cWe forget all too soon the things we thought we would never forget. We forget the loves and the betrayals alike, forget what we whispered and what we screamed, forget who we were.\u201d\nWhat I\u2019m really scared of is not being unhappy or abandoned; it\u2019s committing to giving my best in a world that doesn\u2019t have the structures to know how to give its best back just yet. It\u2019s committing to feeling in a world built to stop at the limits of language. I\u2019m afraid of losing hope, of becoming too tired to keep my heart open. Regardless of this fear, I acknowledge I can\u2019t be any other way. Heartbreak feels like it\u2019s the only journey to knowing true love. The queerplatonic relationships I have now have made every heartbreak worth it, and I anticipate they will continue to.\nDidion says,\n\u201cIt all comes back. Remember what it is to be me. That is always the point.\u201d\nIn this mess of a few years, I think what I\u2019m waiting for are the moments we all start to remember what it feels like to be us. To fearlessly jump into the arms of another, to love without second-guessing or over-analyzing, and to trust that our hearts might know more than we ever will.\nAn Injustice!\nA new intersectional publication, geared towards voices, values, and identities!aninjusticemag.com", "comment_count": 1, "like_count": 259, "created_time": 1640485825949, "comment": [{"user_id": "e75b45a4573f", "comment_time": 1640485825949, "comment": "Thank you for sharing!"}, {"user_id": "ed8c3a6912d6", "comment_time": 1642695613066, "comment": "Woww.

I was hunched over, staring at different-sized puddles that reflected fragments of me. I tried to pick them back up, swallow them, chew them; I wanted to hold them in my mouth. I stared at them at length and attempted to make sense of a body that was no longer there.\nScattered across this year are the traces of learned, protective pieces of a former self \u2014 someone who had held onto structures and souls with blind faith that distracted from expiry dates long passed. We hope and pray that we can still use an aching heart if it means being able to tuck ourselves into a warm bed at night. Without even realizing it, we start to call that ache home.\n2020 started with my Baba\u2019s death, my grandmother, who was one of my best friends. She suddenly became unresponsive on Christmas day and never woke again. We had her funeral on New Year\u2019s Eve and January 1, 2020, was the beginning of a year that would not know her. I loved her more than I knew possible. I wrote in my journal sometime in February, \u201cthere are some things love can\u2019t fix or change, it can only sit with you simply and wait.\u201d To think that at that point, we had little idea of the depth of what was to come in the months ahead and how desperately we would all need the patience and presence of love sitting and waiting with us.\nOne of the most complicated things about death is that we never lose anyone all at once. Even the most sudden endings drag themselves across your life in decades and in moments that come running back, reminding you of a dream you once lived in or could have. Grief is not over once the funeral is, or the break-up happens; once one year later comes, the first birthday passes or when you receive your last cheque in the mail. It comes when you most and least expect it. Grief feels impossible to predict, and often when it meets us, we give it the name of something it\u2019s not, so it\u2019s easier to swallow.\nIn V.S. Naipaul\u2019s essay The Strangeness of Grief, he writes, \u201cWe are never finished with grief. It is part of the fabric of living. It is always waiting to happen. Love makes memories and life precious; the grief that comes to us is proportionate to that love and is inescapable.\u201d\nEach time I feel raw grief, the kind that expands in your belly and up into your chest, it\u2019s like being emptied. It hallows you and leaves you with nothing but space, a room you can fill with whatever you choose. Any distraction we might pick up, at some point, will settle into a place that no longer distracts. We can pick up another, but what comes, and sooner as we clutter up our room, is the presence of the same two options. We can distract ourselves once more, or we can become acquainted with our hallow self. Who are we when our world as we know it goes quiet? Who are we when we realize it\u2019s not us who holds control of what\u2019s to come?\nIn fear of possible answers, we can shrink ourselves during moments of change to hold onto some stability, regaining some semblance of control. We can squeeze into spaces, so small no one notices you\u2019re even there. I know many bodies that hold their childhood heart, who keep themselves small to remain safe. I have lived in many cupboards of houses, tucked away in corners, using the dust that accumulates to insulate myself there. There have been moments I\u2019ve barely been able to breathe, but in those moments, I didn\u2019t know anything else. What I used to define myself ended up becoming a shield that prevented me from seeing any other option for air. At a certain point in this process, I became passive. Comfortability is a skilled temptress. Though we may feel comfortable, the longer we hold onto ourselves in place, with an obstructed view of the world, the harder it is to believe that there\u2019s any way out. Nothing good for us comes alongside the feeling of being trapped. Stepping out from behind the protection we once carefully built for ourselves is an active choice, one that feels like throwing everything you know away. It is not easy, nor does it come second nature.\n\u201cTo come to know a love so deep that now I know it\u2019s possible\u2026 So I can learn from her love and give it to others to know.\u201d is what I heard when I had nothing left protecting me. It echoed in the emptiness and the quiet I once feared.\nMy whole life, I\u2019ve tried to love people an indecipherable amount that would heal them and take away their pain. When you watch people you love have to suffer, regardless of the amount you are pouring out of your heart, the affirmation is that you are not enough and that love is not enough. The poet Sarah Kay writes, \u201cyour hands will always be too small to catch all the pain you want to heal.\u201d The co-existence of love and pain is pervasive and unavoidable. Even in the best of times, there will always be both in the world. I now know love as not to be used in the removal of something but rather as a practice that enables movement forward. It does not remove suffering; it is the removal of having to suffer alone.\nPico Iyer, a Japanese poet, recalls this as,\n\u201cJoyful participation in a world full of sorrows\u2026every life ends in death, every meeting ends in a separation, but that\u2019s not a reason to grieve. It\u2019s actually a reason to find our beauty and joy right now.\u201d\nTo accompany Pico\u2019s insight, I thought of story-teller Kevin Kling. He says that there are losses we are born with, and there are losses we grow into; sooner or later, we all know what it feels like to break. He says that though a broken heart might never be able to go backward, might never be the same as it once was, our hearts can heal, which is the single most hopeful thing we have.\nDeath has been the blanket around most of us the last year and a half. If we were unacquainted with the idea of it before, we have become acquainted now. bell hooks says, \u201cThe presence of death \u2026 can make us put everything in proper perspective.\u201d I wonder what proper perspective means for many of us.\nWhen applied to the broader community, death should sharpen our priorities and prompt us to rebuild in ways that care for those suffering alone or those suffering at the hands of others. Maybe sitting in empty, quiet spaces together will make those spaces feel less daunting and enable us to rebuild in ways some have never thought of before. Maybe in those spaces, we can learn how to listen. I\u2019m wondering what a healed community looks and feels like. I imagine that it\u2019s where one can find collective joy amidst sorrow and see in puddles of tears whole, healed hearts.", "comment_count": 1, "like_count": 27, "created_time": 1629770816909, "comment": [{"user_id": "e75b45a4573f", "comment_time": 1629770816909, "comment": "Thank you for sharing!"}, {"user_id": "e903a3883281", "comment_time": 1630310812302, "comment": "You really had me thinking with this piece.

Now it\u2019s happening here!\nME: We\u2019ve been that way for several years here in central PA. It was, believe it or not, an improvement for us! We went for many years before the final switch, having to dial the area code for an inter-LATA call (aka \u201clocal long distance\u201d) but not an intra-LATA call (\u201clocal\u201d) \u2014 even with the same area code. How did you know without looking at a map from the phone company? When you got a \u201cbrr-Brr-BRR!\u201d error if you picked the wrong option! So we needed to dial eleven digits to call my late in-laws from home, but seven if we called from work. Now we just dial eleven. Well, ten, actually, because who calls long distance on a landline these days?\nWe went into discussions about having to choose whether to just get local service or \u201cextended\u201d local service \u2014I\u2019d totally forgotten about those days (and I used to work for a local phone company!). And then there were the old landline habits that Millennials seldom experienced and GenZs know nothing about.\nME: When Deb worked at the university and had student helpers, she had to explain how landline phones worked. Not the buttons (these weren\u2019t rotary!) but the 1 before the number \u2014 the kids thought it was arbitrary and silly.\nMARNY: The \u201c1\u201d gets the caller into the long distance system. The alternative is \u201c0\u201d, which uses an operator to place the call, even though you dial all the numbers. It would be for something like person-to-person where you would only be charged for the call if the person to whom you want to speak is available and takes the call.\nME: I would LOVE to see you explaining all that to a GenZ! \ud83d\ude01 They would think you were making it all up.\nWhen I worked for Sprint/United Telephone in Carlisle, PA, we still had some of the old (OLD!) analog switching units in use in the downtown office. I could stand outside the \u201ccloset\u201d and hear the difference between local and long-distance calls going through. While I was still there in 1994, almost a floor of analog switches got replaced by a digital unit the size of a household fridge, with several times the capacity. And then there were the even older landlines\u2026\nMARNY: My grandparents in rural Wisconsin were on a party line! To call someone else on the same line, you picked up the receiver, listened to make sure no one else was on the line, dialed the last five digits of the number you wanted, then hung up so the other person\u2019s phone would ring. After about 10\u201315 seconds you picked up your phone again and hoped the person you were calling was on the line. I always thought it was rude to dial a friend\u2019s number and then hang up the phone.\nME: Deb had a party line growing up, into her high school years! Problem #1: her dad was a pastor, and sharing a party line was NOT a good thing when people called with problems (Dad had to get an extension line installed from the church office so he could take \u201cwork calls\u201d at home). #2: although Deb dated in high school as much as I did (not at all, IOW) her younger sister was VERY popular with the boys\u2026 and a party line was NOT conducive to teenage conversations. For some odd reason, Dad never came up with a solution to that one.\nDEB: Our line worked like what Marny describes, only we didn\u2019t actually have to hang up, we just did a \u201chook switch\u201d where we put our finger on the hook for a couple seconds and then lifted it. But I could see how a kid would think they were \u201changing up.\u201d Or maybe their phones were different.\nAlso back in the old days, you were only supposed to use phones from \u201cThe Phone Company\u201d (there was only one) and you got charged for every phone (not line, EACH TELEPHONE) you had.\nMARNY: My sister moved her bedroom up to the room in the attic (formerly the guest room; her old room became the guest room). Then she ran a phone extension line into her room. That was when you were charged for the number of phones you had and Daddy found out when he saw additional charges on the phone bill. He was pissed! He also made her take out her extension.\nYes, The Phone Company knew when you\u2019d been bad or good\u2026\nAny stories anyone else wants to share?", "comment_count": 5, "like_count": 328, "created_time": 1644707203812, "comment": [{"user_id": "db0cae7468d0", "comment_time": 1644707203812, "comment": "Thank you for sharing!"}, {"user_id": "b9a741c1027b", "comment_time": 1651550030427, "comment": "We had a party line when I was a kid in LA but when I went to visit my aunt in Washington she didn\u2019t, it was weird.

And while I was there, I used them to do washing for [our grandnephew, over a year old] and tried them out! I even showed [sister-in-law, grandnephew\u2019s grandmother] how the dryer can open from either the side or hinged at the bottom, depending on how you pull it!\nME: So you\u2026 like them?\nDEB: Yes, honey! You can order them.\nDelivery took a few weeks, which actually worked better than we feared, the current supply chain being what it is. The two guys who did the delivery let us know before they arrived, nodded approvingly when they saw we had actually followed the preparation instructions in their company\u2019s email, and were in and out in half an hour.\nDEB: They\u2019re white!\nME: Um, yes? Our old ones were white. I thought you liked white. I didn\u2019t even think to ask.\nDEB: The ones at [niece & nephew\u2019s house] are stainless steel. I thought that\u2019s all they had.\nME: (remembering the no-return policy) White is okay?\nDEB: White is wonderful, honey!\nThe old units were taken away and\u2026 um, taken to a farm for old appliances in the northern part of the state? Something like that. I didn\u2019t really pay attention to the details.\nDEB: So there is a manual, but also cards with basic instructions that suction-cup to the side of the washer? That\u2019s nice!\nME: Yes, so I\u2019ve been looking over the manual, and\u2014\nDEB: Honey, it\u2019s a washer and dryer. I\u2019ve already tried them out. It\u2019s not that hard.\nME: Oh. Good point. Okay, I just need to borrow your phone to install the app.\nDEB: (pause) I\u2019m sorry, the what?\nSo I install the app and introduce it to our home network infrastructure.\nAPP: What do you want to call the unit \u201cWASHER\u201d?\nME: Um, \u201cWasher\u201d?\nAPP: Accepted.\nThen I start playing with it.\nME: You can set the washer to start remotely. Just put in everything like you would before a load, then tell it to stand by for further instructions.\nDEB: Uh huh. There\u2019s a feature I\u2019ll use a lot. \u201cHey, I\u2019m grocery shopping, think I\u2019ll start the washer!\u201d\nME: Um, yes. And you can also program the washer to start at a later time.\nDEB: Will you be horribly unhappy if I just, I dunno, wash and dry clothes? Like a regular person?\nMeanwhile I\u2019m still processing the fact our washer has a clear top and our dryer has a window in front.\n\nDryer (left) and washer, with loads visible through the doors. The dryer also has a light inside that can be turned off and on. (photos by author)\nIt\u2019s not wrong. It\u2019s just different, is all. (Shush!)\nDEB: How do I do the remote thing?\nME: What?\nDEB: We\u2019re putting flowers on Mom and Dad\u2019s grave. If I can start the washer remotely, I can tell it to start when we start home. Then I\u2019ll just move it into the dryer as we get home, and we won\u2019t have permanent press stuff wrinkling.\nI read up on it; it\u2019s easy. I talk Deb through it.\nME: Why does it make music like that?\nDEB: That\u2019s its happy startup tune. And happy function-understood notes. They\u2019re happy little appliances!\nME: Ooooookaaaay\u2026.\nWe take flowers to the cemetery. We have reception on our phones (benefits of a cemetery on a hill). Deb tells the washer to do its thing. As we get close to home, Deb hears an alert and pulls out her phone.\nDEB: Washer\u2019s done. I can move the load into the dryer when I\u2019m ready.\nME: Why isn\u2019t it talking to me?\nDEB: You\u2019re driving, Jackster. It knows that.\nME: Oh yeah\u2026\nThursday night. Deb has to be somewhere late Friday morning, and won\u2019t be back until Sunday.\nDEB: Okay. This will work. I load the washer tonight. Set it to start before we wake up tomorrow. We roll out of bed, BOOM, the load is done.\nME: Okay, want me to show you how\u2014\nDEB: It\u2019s fine, honey, I figured it out. The washer likes me. I\u2019m its mom.\nWe get out of bed Friday morning. As I change into workout gear I get an alert on my smart watch from the washer that it\u2019s done. (I\u2019m not driving. It knows that.) I tap on Deb\u2019s bathroom door.\nME: Debster, we got\u2014\nDEB: I know! I got buzzed!\n(Yes, she takes her phone into the bathroom. Don\u2019t judge.)\nI go to put my sleep stuff in the laundry basket. No I don\u2019t, it\u2019s not there. No, it\u2019s downstairs, of course\u2014 wait! Is it too late to add it to the load? I ask Deb. (It\u2019s her laundry operation, I just benefit.)\nDEB: Sure, honey! Just drop it in. Tell the washer it\u2019s okay!\nSay what? So I go downstairs, into the laundry room\u2014where the first load is now in the dryer but the next washer load hasn\u2019t been started yet\u2014and open the washer lid.\nOr not. It\u2019s locked. It\u2019s locked?\nME: Debster? The washer won\u2019t let me add my stuff!\nWASHER: So, you want to add to my load? YOU want to add to MY load? Sure, sure\u2026 AND PEOPLE IN HELL WANT ICE WATER, CUPCAKE! When Mom tells me it\u2019s okay, maybe I\u2019ll think about it. (You can read a lot from a smart washer\u2019s body language, if you know what to look for.)\nDEB: (arriving on scene) No, honey, that\u2019s a safety thing, it locks the lid. Here! (Presses button, washer beeps; she lifts the lid, I drop in my clothes, she closes the lid, the washer makes happy beeps, she starts the load.)\nWasher smirks at me.\nSo now Deb is downstairs on the treadmill, I\u2019m working out from the Apple Exercise+ routine on the television, which is hooked to our smart hub. Laundry is still in process.\nDeb pops up from the basement.\nDEB: Dryer is done!\nME: I know, the alert popped up on the TV. I figured you\u2019d be up shortly.\nLaundry is done in time for Deb to leave on schedule. As she leaves she gives the washer and dryer hugs.\nDEB: I really DO like living in the 21st Century, honey!\nWell\u2026 that\u2019s good. Since we\u2019ll be here the rest of our lives.\n\u00b9Deb does most of the laundry, I do most of the cooking, and for similar reasons: we enjoy the sense of accomplishment when we\u2019re done, and there is a certain joy in doing things our way.\nConversations with My Wife (collection)\nThe collected conversations (chats, whatever) with my wife, in case you liked some and want to read more.medium.com", "comment_count": 7, "like_count": 644, "created_time": 1650656938952, "comment": [{"user_id": "db0cae7468d0", "comment_time": 1650656938952, "comment": "Thank you for sharing!"}, {"user_id": "50d08656451f", "comment_time": 1650842159572, "comment": "OMG!

Yet, as we head into what seems to be the home stretch of the race to pass the so-called \u201cBuild Back Better Bill,\u201d that\u2019s just what Joe Biden and Nancy Pelosi are proposing. This bill is a waste of money, and, more importantly of political opportunity that may not recur in the foreseeable future. Meanwhile, the $3.5 trillion version would have been impactful and pragmatic, while also being a potentially game-changing political win for Democrats. Progressives should threaten to vote the whole package down, including both this bill and the bipartisan corporate welfare bill (mis-named \u201cinfrastructure bill\u201d), unless some of what has been slashed is restored.\nRecent days have been all about shifting the blame from right wing Democrats to progressives, with Joe Manchin\u2019s pot-calling-the-kettle-black demand that progressive Democrats stop \u201cplaying politics\u201d and \u201cholding the infrastructure bill hostage.\u201d But it\u2019s not only Manchin and his partner in corruption, Kirsten Sinema. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi demonstrated a similar bent when she implored progressives not to \u201cembarrass\u201d Biden by opposing the bill. The sad truth is, Biden has embarrassed himself throughout this entire affair.\nBut the tactic seems to have worked, with the leader of the Progressive Congressional Caucus, Pramila Jayapal, today saying that \u201c\u2026we will be happy to vote both those bills \u2014 both the infrastructure bill and the Build Back Better bill \u2014 through the House, and I\u2019m hoping that can happen as soon as tomorrow or the next day.\u201d\nDisingenuously calling the bill \u201ctransformational,\u201d when everything that would have fit that description has been slashed from the bill, Jayapal also said \u201cWe trust the President that he will get 51 votes for this.\u201d This trust seems na\u00efve at best, but the coming days will tell.\nAs to the contents of the \u201cBuild Back Better\u201d bill, well, while the old adage that half a loaf is better than none is true, it doesn\u2019t apply to this case, despite the frequency with which both conservatives and liberals have been throwing it around lately. The BBB bill, as it stands now isn\u2019t remotely close to half a loaf. It is more than half the price of the full loaf but for maybe 20% of the loaf, and the worst parts of the loaf at that.\nWhether or not there is a way past the Manchin\u2019s and Sinema\u2019s unwavering obstructionism is unknown, since Democrats have tried nothing but surrender after surrender. The singular focus on these two senators is itself a questionable strategy. Why, we should be asking, have Democrats not been hammering Republicans, who stand united against the overwhelmingly popular provisions that have been cut from the BBB bill.\nBack in January, Manchin tried a similar stunt with the covid relief package. Since that was something Biden actually backed in a substantive way, he dispatched Kamala Harris to West Virginia. She appeared in several locations in the state, as well as local television. She told West Virginians just what was in the bill that their senator was trying to block. Manchin caved.\nThat is PRECISELY what has NOT been done with this bill. Most Americans do not know what is in the bill, and that\u2019s even after efforts \u2014 far too little and far too late \u2014 in recent weeks to finally detail that to the public. Yet the components of the bill in its $3.5T form all poll incredibly well, with even significant minorities of Republicans supporting them. And that broad and overwhelming support is most visible in key items that have been stripped from the bill such as allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices and paid family leave.\nThere is evidence that campaigning on substance would have swayed Manchin. Sinema is anyone\u2019s guess since no one even knows what she wants. But it would certainly be a lot harder for her to stand on her own.\nThe suicidally stupid strategy (borne out by polls that show a partisan split on the bill despite the overwhelmingly positive attitude toward its components, clearly demonstrating the importance of communicating the substance) of not arguing the merits of the bill was a decision of the Democratic leadership, whom progressives permitted to take the lead. For that capitulation, you can certainly blame them. Their strategy was largely wrapped up early on, and that was to accept an historic compromise and allow the bill to be slashed almost in half from its initial $6.5 trillion level to $3.5, and allow Biden to call it his bill, in exchange for the Democratic leadership and the president putting their weight behind the bill. In fairness, Pelosi and Schumer did their part. Biden completely shirked his, which, given his historic position as MBNA\u2019s senator, should not come as a surprise, although it did for many.\nProgressives have allowed themselves to be backed into a corner as much by Biden as by Sinema and Manchin, although the former surely has reason to see this bill passed in massively watered-down form, while the latter two have only the corporate giveaway accompanying it to motivate them. That can be salvaged by picking one issue \u2014 say, the most popular, allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices or, perhaps the slightly safer one, family leave \u2014 and holding both bills hostage to it. Otherwise the capitulation is what is historic, for rarely has there been an opportunity to so fundamentally change this country that has the backing of so overwhelming a majority of voters.\nAs to the merits of what\u2019s left, sure, there are some good things there. But it is only \u201chistoric\u201d in the context of reversing what has been four decades of inexorable fleecing of most of the populace for a tiny minority of wealthy people.\nObamacare is a good comparison. Did it make a difference? Yes. Did it mark a reversal in taking care of people? Yes. It was, in fact, the biggest step forward since Medicare itself. But did it still leave us with a massive health care crisis in this country? If that wasn\u2019t apparent before covid, it is a virtually universally acknowledged truth now, and the promise that it would be built upon has been exposed as a pathetic lie. It has seen nothing but rollbacks since its inception, and Biden has been a big part of that problem, undermining universal health care at every stage.\nAgain, it is good that Medicare will cover hearing, but that was by far the smallest and cheapest proposed change. It is good that there will be some addressing of climate change, but the tax credits proposed are so obviously inadequate, and will equally obviously not come close to the already vastly insufficient results that Biden is ludicrously claiming (tax credit strategies and similar incentives never pay off at anything close to these projections, depending as they do on the whims of the market and on the good will of big business). Universal pre-K is certainly a good thing, but the only reason that has not been opposed is that it means parents can now work even more monstrously long hours than they already were. On the other hand, things that would actually pay for themselves, like Medicare negotiating drug prices, free community college and other measures were all stripped out.\nProgressives should not allow the bipartisan infrastructure bill to pass for such a meager price. The gains here are not nearly big enough to justify undermining any progressive attempt to make significant change (which the \u201creconciliation bill\u201d is certainly not) in the future. Such surrender will mean all the gains progressive made in Congress will be soon reversed since they will have shown themselves unwilling and unable to win even with the overwhelming support of American voters across the political spectrum.\nYet, if neither bill passes, the argument goes, Democrats go down to a crushing defeat in 2022. Republicans regain control of Congress, quite possibly both houses. And the White House is certainly in play in 2024. The better cannot be the enemy of the good, and progressives could be painted as the ones at fault for the failure of Biden\u2019s agenda.\nI find this argument unpersuasive. It\u2019s certainly a very cynical argument, but that\u2019s not the main reason for its weakness. It is, ultimately, based on a false reading of politics and a failed vision of policy, and as a guiding strategy, it will doom progress in both the long and short term\nThe bill, as currently constituted, is highly unlikely to save Democrats from the inglorious defeat so many are projecting. What most voters will see in November 2022 is that they continue to struggle, their position has not materially shifted and that Democrats, with control of both the executive and legislative branches have proven unable to effect the serious changes they promised. True, the BBB bill will make some difference in some lives, but the difference won\u2019t be fundamental. The struggle of the people it is supposed to be helping will continue, with, at best, marginal relief. True as well that the defeat of the bills will throw that ongoing struggle into even starker relief, but again, this is unlikely to shift what is currently projecting as a very grim electoral map in 2022 and 2024.\nThat\u2019s not due solely to Democrats\u2019 policy failures, massive though those are. It\u2019s also the continuation of very long term trends that are related to voter suppression and aggressive partisan gerrymandering, both of which Democrats have put very little weight into stopping, despite lofty words. But it is still also due to the fact that, as this fight has demonstrated, Democrats give up easily on popular policies while settling for policies that serve corporate interests.\nThat is EXACTLY what Republicans have used to convince poor and working people to support them (along, of course, with racism, sexism, homophobia, Islamophobia, transphobia, antisemitism, etc. as well as nationalism and jingoism). They have employed rhetoric for decades that has convinced enough people that it is Democrats, not Republicans who serve only elite interests, and that they do it through the \u201cliberal rhetoric of social justice and socialism.\u201d It is an irony, to be sure, and a lie even bigger than Trump\u2019s Big Lie, but it has been effective since the Reagan years, and has only grown more so in the wake of the Contract On America (sic), the Tea Party, and the Trump cult.\nThere are ways to combat that, but they take significant political will and the backbone to fight. On the simplest level, we can see right now that Democrats have refused to put significant political capital behind overwhelmingly popular policies. That is stupid, and it is the most easily changeable factor that works against Democrats.\nBacking away from supporting broadly popular policies, as the Democrats have done yet again has been proven time and time again to exact a HUGE price at the ballot box. Yet that is what corporate donors and, by extension, conservative, moderate, and centrist Democrats demand time and again. Calling for that to change is not standing on principle, it is a clear, necessary, political strategy, something that has eluded the Democrats since Kennedy.\nIf pragmatic \u201cpolitics\u201d dictates this sort of strategy (which it does not) then the only reasonable course of action is to change those politics. Because this capitulation strategy, employed for the last 30 years, has led to consistent losses. But in fact, politics dictates that defying the so-called moderates and centrists will certainly bring many voters to the Democratic party. Yes, the politics of capitulation to the monied and centrist interests is employed for fear of a single crushing defeat which threatens to bring the fascist right back into power with much more strength behind them. That is certainly a frightening prospect. But all this strategy of capitulation does is slow down the march toward that terrible end. It continues to breed voter withdrawal, which we know is the most important factor in Republican victories outside of their stronghold areas. It\u2019s a disastrous strategy that needs to be reversed. This moment, when Democrats hold the White House and both houses of Congress, is THE crucial moment to sharply reverse that decline. If this opportunity is missed, given the erosion of voting rights, there may not be another.\nRight now, what pinning hopes on this gutted BBB bill boils down to is Democrats pitching the idea that their being in power will be bad, or at least not good, for most people, but look how much worse it will be with Republicans. While that pitch is true, it is not an effective motivator of support and voter participation, as we\u2019ve seen in one election after another for many years.\nSo what am I suggesting? There are long term and short term answers to that question.\nTo be clear, I\u2019m not saying that these bills should simply be scuttled out of hand for being insufficient. Rather, I suggest that progressives in Congress band together and stand firm, pick one of the issues that will have real impact and is overwhelmingly popular and say that is a red line, just as Manchin and Sinema have done. I am suggesting they take that case to the people of Arizona and West Virginia, as Biden/Harris did with covid relief and force the recalcitrant senators to back off or risk losing the bipartisan infrastructure deal their patrons so desperately want. That will still leave this bill much weaker than it could and should have been but it will also mean that progressives will have shown that they can stand firm and win, laying a much firmer groundwork for future fights, giving voters a good reason to support progressive Democrats and demonstrating to right wing Democrats that they will not so easily be able to hold the party hostage to what are essentially Republican values.\nStanding firm on that point can then start to shift the focus of the conversation to the Democrats like Manchin and Sinema who are standing against the will of their own voters, and shine the light on Republican malfeasance, where it should be.\nThat leads to a long term strategy that, simply put, depends on implementing policies that American voters broadly and clearly support. That includes virtually everything that was in the original \u201cReconciliation Bill.\u201d When such program are successful and people see what their tax dollars can actually buy them when their government works for them rather than for wealthy donors, more and more progressive policies will be so popular.\nNone of this is about standing on principles of ideology or idealism; it is all political hardball, which is the only way to make gains in Washington. And that sort of populist and popular hardball, with the backing of the majority of Americans is the path Democrats need to, at long last, get on.", "comment_count": 6, "like_count": 207, "created_time": 1635794053288, "comment": [{"user_id": "fa21ef1b3929", "comment_time": 1635794053288, "comment": "Thank you for sharing!"}, {"user_id": "dabf09ccf26b", "comment_time": 1635981277019, "comment": "The Dems are going to have to earn my vote this time around.

Unfortunately, it capitalizes on the fact that Roe itself was a poorly thought out and badly written opinion that qualified what should have been absolute; that is the right of a woman, indeed of any person, to the full control of their own person free o government interference.\nAs Elie Mystal brilliantly points out in his book, Allow Me To Retort, the 4th Amendment should make it clear that a woman has the right to be secure against unreasonable search and seizure. Surely that must include a woman\u2019s womb, even before her home or locker at work. The 14th Amendment guaranteeing equal protection under law must certainly mean that if someone with male reproductive parts has full control over their reproductive system for the full cycle of pregnancy and birth, then so must a person with female reproductive parts.\nBut these were not the arguments of Justice Harry Blackmun, who was justifiably praised for his vote and opinion in Roe because Richard Nixon had specifically appointed Blackmun to the Supreme Court to ensure that abortion was not legalized.\nBut Blackmun, true to his nature at the time (he would become more decisive, and a bit more liberal in his later years), wavered. He delved into tortured considerations because he could not see these guarantees of rights to women in the absolute terms that they apply to men. And so we got Roe v Wade, a flawed opinion that has been under attack ever since.\nAlito\u2019s draft opinion pounces on these weaknesses. He uses Blackmun\u2019s own indecisiveness to help build his case that the Constitution does not protect a woman\u2019s right to full control of her body, because that body can develop and give birth to a child. It is precisely because Blackmun wavered and compromised a woman\u2019s control over her body that Alito can argue that even Roe established that this right was not absolute, but was limited specifically for child-bearing women and no one else. That is, Roe established a separate class of people, with different, more limited rights, at least in this regard.\nThe cynicism and misogyny in Alito\u2019s draft opinion goes much deeper, but I\u2019ll leave it to you to read for yourself.

That was something Donald Trump picked up on early in his 2016 campaign and used to great effect against fellow Republicans in the primaries.\nThe progressive left recognizes that the United States has repeatedly commenced morally repugnant wars, in Vietnam, Central America, Iraq, Afghanistan, and other places, with disastrous results for the people living in those countries, as well as for US troops and the US economy. The right and left, for wildly different reasons, come to jointly oppose American boots on foreign soil.\nJoe Biden explicitly excluded the possibility of military action from the outset of the Ukraine crisis. The stance is warranted, although one might quibble with the wisdom of so plainly announcing this. The decision to do so, likely done for domestic political purposes aimed at avoiding a loud antiwar mobilization, left no doubt in the minds of our allies that the US would neither intervene nor press NATO countries to do so.\nWhile this is the right thing to do, and needs to be defended more than ever, the horrors of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the constant media drumbeat for war weaken the antiwar view, and it also limits the deterrent power the U.S. has. Sanctions became the only coercive tools Biden has. So, he began by imposing sanctions that would inflict \u201csevere costs on the Russian economy.\u201d\nBut the sanctions Biden both employed and threatened Russia with before the invasion proved to be ineffective deterrents. So, the United States and the European Union imposed much harsher sanctions, ones that had an immediate effect on the Russian economy and would severely damage it in the near term.\nMeanwhile, Russia has continued and bolstered its invasion forces, with Belarus now stepping in to assist them. The Ukrainian people have mustered a powerful defense, clearly surprising Putin with their strength and determination. Nonetheless, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy continues to call for direct NATO assistance. He knows Russia has the strength to overpower Ukraine, even if their defense makes it take a longer time. And even if Ukraine does repel the Russian forces, the cost to that country will be devastating.\nSanctions simply can\u2019t deter Russia in the short term. Even Biden noted in his initial announcement that the effects of the sanctions \u201cwill take time.\u201d\nThe sanctions imposed by the West against Russia in the wake of its 2014 aggression and annexation of Crimea have had little visible effect on Russian strategy and policy, according to a report by the European Parliamentary Research Service. Granted, those sanctions were not nearly as harsh as the ones the US and Europe have now imposed, but they have been in place for well over seven years.\nThere is scant reason to expect the 2014 sanctions would change Putin\u2019s plans. While Russia's economic growth has stagnated at less than 1% per year from 2014 to 2020, there were other factors dragging the economy down. Still, as the EPRS report states, \u201cFew dispute that sanctions have caused at least some economic pain to Russia,\u201d and the sanctions President Biden announced initially were stronger and more targeted than those imposed in 2014, while the ones he imposed after the invasion are devastating. The suspension of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project by Germany and the sanctions Biden imposed on the Russian company associated with the project were initial signs that Biden meant what he said. The eventual targeting of Russian banks and the concomitant crash of the ruble were as harsh as sanctions can get.\nBut will those increased sanctions work? While they may be the only tool Biden has if he, correctly, refuses to put troops on the ground, history suggests sanctions are unlikely to do the job. Simply put, the track record of sanctions affecting policy change is terrible.\nRussia has taken steps to defend against sanctions since 2014. They have increased their reserve funds in their central banks, and significantly slashed the percentage of those funds held in dollars. They\u2019ve limited their reliance on foreign investors and diminished the amount of their debt held outside the country. And they have strengthened trade ties to China, which initially signaled that it will help Russia weather the sanctions storm. So far, China seems to be sticking to that position, although they have been ambiguous publicly.\nNone of that will stop the sanctions from having a significant impact on Russia\u2019s economy, especially since Europe seems willing to endure a good deal of economic pain for the sake of pressuring Russia. But it does mean that Russia is in a better position to endure the sanctions rather than back down from Western pressure, something a ruler like Putin undoubtedly sees not only as humiliating but harmful to Russian interests. For autocrats like Putin, there is no distinction between the self and the state.\nIn general, sanctions often fail to bring about policy changes. The most obvious example is Cuba, where more than six decades of embargo have not made Cuba revert to its former capitalist structure. Various sanctions were imposed on North Korea since 2006, yet they proceeded with their nuclear weapons program undeterred.\nPerhaps the best illustration of the sanctions dilemma is Iran. When President Barack Obama imposed sanctions, he hoped to bring Iran to the negotiating table. When some in Congress wanted to impose more sanctions, Obama threatened a veto because the talks were proceeding. Eventually, the Iran nuclear deal was consummated.\nThe sanctions on Iran related to its nuclear program were lifted, while other, unrelated ones, remained in place. Iran\u2019s economy began a slow recovery, with threats to the deal discouraging the kind of investment Tehran had hoped for, but the deal was working. Iran stuck to it and Obama had a major foreign policy victory.\nThis was undone by Donald Trump, who unilaterally abandoned the JCPOA and instituted his disastrous \u201cmaximum pressure campaign,\u201d which featured enhanced sanctions in an effort to get Iran to capitulate to U.S. diktats on an imagined \u201cbetter deal.\u201d The result was escalated tension in the Persian Gulf and Iran coming much closer to nuclear weapons capability than it had ever been before.\nWhy did Trump fail so miserably while Obama succeeded?\nTrump tried to use sanctions to force Iran into submission. Obama used them as a stick to entice Iran into accepting the carrot of short-term economic relief and long-term stability and regional integration. More importantly, Obama wanted Iran to agree to abandon a quest for a nuclear weapon, something even United States intelligence confirmed they had not pursued since 2003, and which they may never have truly wanted. The desired outcome benefited Iran as much as anyone. That made it possible for Iran\u2019s moderate leaders to work with the United States and the other countries (ironically, including Russia) that were parties to the deal.\nBy contrast, Putin has what he perceives as compelling reasons to invade Ukraine, whether that be NATO expansion, the desire to create a new security bloc with Ukraine bolstering Russia and Belarus, rebuilding the USSR, or the nationalistic, revisionist tales he wove on Russian television just before launching the invasion. He also has the direct experience of the Crimea annexation to bolster his belief that this move will win him more popular support, however dubious that conclusion might be.\nAll that is magnified by the autocrat\u2019s eternal fear of backing down, being \u201cout-masculined,\u201d showing weakness. Indeed, an autocrat like Putin only strengthens his resolve when confronted by sanctions. If a democratic leader is afraid of looking weak in international affairs, an autocrat is desperate to avoid that perception.\nThus, sanctions are unlikely to work with Putin, but Biden has no viable alternative. The military option is much worse and has the potential to ignite a global conflict. Plus, it is not supported by the American public. Sanctions are all he\u2019s got, and even if they do work, it will be at the cost of enormous suffering among the Russian people \u2014 who, let\u2019s remember, didn\u2019t ask for this war and don\u2019t seem to be supporting it \u2014 and the devastation of Ukraine. Because even if they do work, it will take time.\nBy their very nature, sanctions are not a tool for immediate deterrence. Putin surely knew harsh sanctions were coming and proceeded regardless. They can have an effect over time, but even that is uncertain.\nThat leaves Biden with a choice between sanctions (bad) and military action (worse). That is not sustainable if we expect to prevent great powers from launching illegal wars of choice, whether it\u2019s Russia in Ukraine or the United States in Iraq.\nEven more worrisome, those who support the continuation and strengthening of the NATO alliance couldn\u2019t have dreamed of a better point in favor of their argument. There can be little doubt that, no matter how this war ends, a new era of increased militarization is very likely upon us. At the very least, those of us advocating for a more peaceful, less militarist future are going to have a harder time convincing others of the merits of our case.\nMoreover, sanctions themselves are often inconsistent with international law. Unless they are very narrowly targeted, they are a form of collective punishment. The Geneva Convention states, \u201cNo protected person may be punished for an offence he or she has not personally committed. Collective penalties and likewise all measures of intimidation or of terrorism are prohibited.\u201d This is most obviously violated when the hope is that the sanctions will cause so much harm to the civilian population that they will overthrow their leader (which has never worked). But it is also violated when a blanket sanction is aimed at a country\u2019s entire economy. Nonetheless, that is still preferable to warfare.\nWorse, if sanctions are proven ineffective in deterring Russia, as they have proven to be in almost all other cases, then we are left to choose between simply allowing aggressors to pillage and capture non-NATO nations or intervening militarily all over the world. Neither is tolerable.\nThe international community needs another option, and quickly, even if it\u2019s too late to help Ukraine. We need to create mutually beneficial arrangements to disincentivize aggression before conflicts arise. We need to give existing international institutions greater power to intervene in disputes before they grow into crises. We need, in short, to develop a broad toolkit that prevents situations like Ukraine from arising in the first place without risking World War III at every turn, and non-lethal ways to respond should another state act as Putin is now.\nSystems need to be binding on all. They cannot be dependent on an individual country refusing to be a party to that system because, like the US\u2019 refusal to join the International Criminal Court, they want the freedom to act without the constraint of legal consequence. They need to prevent not only a Russian invasion of Ukraine but also an American invasion of Iraq. They must bind not only great powers like the US and Russia, but also smaller countries invading, occupying, and annexing land as Israel and Morocco have. They must bar interference in the affairs of other countries, as Saudi Arabia has done in Yemen, as well as prevent atrocities in civil wars such as the massive crimes of the Syrian regime, abetted by Russia.\nThe first step is to recognize that both military deterrence and sanctions have failed as the conflict prevention tools that we need. The search for a better option must begin now. It must begin by recognizing as well that the limitations placed on the United Nations have rendered the institution impotent. And it must begin by confronting those who oppose international institutions in general, debating them, and convincing them otherwise.\nIf we don\u2019t, Ukraine will be only the first of many such scenarios.", "comment_count": 11, "like_count": 207, "created_time": 1646167124056, "comment": [{"user_id": "fa21ef1b3929", "comment_time": 1646167124056, "comment": "Ukraine Shows We Need a Third Option Besides War and Sanctions"}, {"user_id": "1e0aa218e049", "comment_time": 1646383402317, "comment": "Brilliant!

They evicted the family, arresting some of them and leaving the rest of them to watch as, later in the day, bulldozers demolished their homes.\nThanks to the attention Palestinians and their supporters have brought to Sheikh Jarrah, there was some response to this latest Israeli outrage, even if there was, as usual, no material action taken as a result. The world is expressing more discomfort with what can only be described as ethnic cleansing in East Jerusalem but is still taking no action to stop it or hold Israel to even the slightest account.\nOne supportive response came from Rep. Jackie Speier of California. Tweeting a New York Times article covering the episode, Speier wrote: \u201cWhere is the humanity? On what basis did the Israeli police evict a family of 15 in the cold of night in East Jerusalem and beat and arrest the male family members! What 2-state solution can be had with continued actions like these?\u201d\nIt\u2019s a good statement, but it also reflects the inability of not only the United States but virtually all international actors to help in resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and putting an end to Israel\u2019s occupation and to its apartheid system.\nSpeier\u2019s mention of a two-state solution feels forced in that tweet, as if she had to squeeze it into an awkward spot, which is just what she did. Had she not, she would have left herself open to accusations of opposing the existence of Israel. Although such an accusation would be absurd, it would have real impact politically on a congresswoman representing a well-to-do California district with liberal leanings and a moderately-sized Jewish population.\nThe State of Two States\nBoth the Israeli government and its powerful affiliated groups in the United States have moved aggressively over the past decade to undermine any possibility of a two-state solution. The result is a Republican party which openly supports Israel\u2019s apartheid policies and a Democratic party that pays lip service to a two-state solution that hasn\u2019t been feasible for years. But suggesting any alternative is considered a hopelessly radical position.\nWith very few exceptions, even the most Israel-critical voices in Congress, such as Bernie Sanders and Ilhan Omar, support a two-state solution. Although the public discourse has expanded to begin exploring alternatives (a discourse which includes prominent, forward-thinking, but still patriotic Israelis and Palestinians), this, like virtually all reality-based approaches to Israel and Palestine, has not touched Capitol Hill at all. Hence, Speier\u2019s need to thrust \u201cTwo States\u201d into her statement.\nThere is nothing wrong with a two-state solution in the abstract. It is far from perfect justice, but that is rarely attainable in this world, and alternative solutions involve serious compromises of their own from all parties, as well as obstacles just as formidable as those to a two-state solution. But it hardly merits being the only acceptable option.\nI supported the two-state solution for years, although never exclusively. The factors for me were these:\nIt was the solution favored by majorities of both Israelis and Palestinians for a long time. After the Clinton Parameters \u2014 which were an improvement over what came before but still ill-conceived \u2014 came out at the end of 2000, the support for two states held on both sides. The Taba Summit improved upon them, and largely formed the basis for some extra-governmental efforts like the Geneva Initiative. But it mattered that both Israelis and Palestinians, in poll after poll, supported this framework. That has changed, much more than is generally acknowledged, as I will discuss below.\nThe international community accepted it. Even before the Madrid Conference in 1991 and the Oslo Agreements of 1993\u20131995, there was a broad international consensus, sparked by Yasir Arafat\u2019s decision in 1974 to focus on a state in whatever parts of Palestine the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) could liberate, to support the creation of a Palestinian state beside Israel. It fit well with UN Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, even though neither of them specifically referred to a Palestinian state. And while it presented a difficult road, it seemed diplomatically feasible, especially if both parties worked in good faith to pursue it. Sadly, that good faith was not to be found in sectors on both sides, but most devastatingly, in the Israeli government, no matter who led it.\nGiven those conditions, two states made the most sense for work within the United States. The United States, and especially Congress, is the most hostile place for Palestinian rights in the world, outside of Israel. Trying to argue against the one way forward that could at least be discussed in Washington seemed self-defeating at the time.\nBut conditions have changed, even if the discourse in Washington has not. As we are seeing with the latest attempt at a confederation model \u2014 this time from former Israeli diplomat Yossi Beilin and Palestinian attorney Hiba Husseini \u2014 and as we have seen for years from advocates for one secular, democratic state, there are many different ways in which people are trying to revise or challenge the moribund two-state paradigm.\nThe two-state solution is no longer favored by majorities in Israel or in the Palestinian areas under Israeli occupation. In July 2021, a poll by the Israeli Democracy Institute reported that only 34% of Jewish Israelis said they preferred a two-state solution to the status quo of occupation, which 41.5% preferred. Among Palestinians, 59% oppose a two-state solution, while only 39% still support two states, according to a poll in December 2021 by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Social Research. These results represent long term trends.\nBut it\u2019s even more complicated than that. The Israeli government is in overwhelming agreement that any two-state solution must leave Israel in control of the strategically valuable Jordan Valley. While many Israelis oppose annexing the Jordan Valley unilaterally, most Israeli Jews believe Israel must maintain control over that patch of land in any future agreement with the Palestinians.\nThe Jordan Valley and the Northern Dead Sea area, which Israel might also insist on, cover some 30% of the West Bank, greatly diminishing the available sovereign territory that would be available for a Palestinian state. It would also mean that Israel would control the Palestinians\u2019 access to Jordan, as they do now. Jordan is home to a large Palestinian population, and Palestinian families often have members living in both Jordan and Palestine.\nMoreover, a nascent Palestinian state would desperately need easy and secure access to Jordan for business reasons. And, of course, this would make north-south commuting and transport through the West Bank significantly more difficult for Palestinians. It would not look very much like an independent state.\nAnd if the Israeli ambition for the Jordan Valley is problematic, the attitude toward Jerusalem is even more so. It\u2019s a point on which most Jewish Israeli leaders agree, as does the Israeli Jewish public. Outside of the miniscule Meretz party, and the non-Zionist and Arab parties, few politicians are diverging from the line that Jerusalem must remain the undivided capital of Israel.\nThe United States takes a similar posture of ambiguity leaning toward Israeli dominance. While the U.S. still officially backs the idea of Jerusalem\u2019s status being settled by negotiations, the realities of its policies paint a quite different picture.\nWhen Donald Trump refused to waive the 1995 Jerusalem Embassy Act in 2017, the official U.S. position on Jerusalem did not change, but its de facto policy was fundamentally altered. Instead of playing along with the fiction of Jerusalem being an international city \u2014 a willful denial of the reality that Israel had seized control of the entire city and had faced no repercussions for doing so \u2014 the U.S. had now effectively recognized Israel\u2019s sovereignty in the city.\nOne can argue that since Trump said the U.S. was not making any statement on the final status of the city, that there was still room for creative ambiguity. But both the physical and political realties since that day show that is not the case. In practice, the 1995 bill \u2014 passed by an overwhelming bipartisan majority \u2014 was always intended as support for Israeli sovereignty over the whole city, and that is just how it has played out.\nPalestinians, of course, never accepted this move. Neither the populace nor even the subservient Palestinian Authority have stopped objecting to, and demanding the reversal of, the move of the U.S. embassy and its concomitant impact on the status of Jerusalem. Yet the administration of Joe Biden, who campaigned on a promise to at least reopen a consulate that had once served as an unofficial liaison office of sorts to the PA, has done nothing at all to alter the status quo it inherited from Trump.\nNot only has settlement growth in the West Bank expanded, but that expansion has steadily accelerated for many years. With 132 settlements and 140 so-called \u201cunauthorized\u201d outposts in the West Bank, there are now over 440,000 Jewish settlers in the territory. Some 200,000 more live in areas that have been annexed by Israel (though even the United States has not recognized this) in East Jerusalem.\nThis vast network is comprised of large blocs of settlements along with other, more isolated ones, strategically placed around the West Bank. These make up what Israeli activist and intellectual Jeff Halper dubbed the \u201cMatrix of Control\u201d some 20 years ago. The intervening years have only served to enhance Halper\u2019s point.\nSupporters of the two-state solution have long contended that these settlements could simply be abandoned, either demolished or the inhabitants moved within Israel\u2019s final borders and the towns, some of them small cities, given to the Palestinians.\nEven when the two-state solution looked like a real possibility, this was an unrealistic prospect. The withdrawal from Gaza had political repercussions for Israel that are still being felt to this day. While much attention in the media was paid to the narrative that the withdrawal from Gaza was not managed properly, the reality is that what we saw there was a tiny fraction of what will happen to Israeli society if the country pulls out of the West Bank.\nThere were only 8,000 or so Jewish settlers in Gaza, an area which offers little of material value to Israel. It is resource poor, and while its coastline carries some benefit, Israel already has an extensive western coast just north of the Strip.\nAdditionally, the land of Gaza itself holds much less meaning, both in a religious and a nationalistic sense, for Jews, in and out of Israel. Gaza was a part of Palestine for centuries, but it was never a part of the historical, much less biblical, Eretz Yisrael (Land of Israel), the iconic Jewish homeland. In and of itself, surrendering Gaza was a relatively easy pill for nationalistic Zionists, religious and secular, to swallow.\nThe West Bank is a completely different case. It is the very cradle of Jewish connection to the land. There is no mention in the Bible of Tel Aviv or Haifa. But Hebron, Nablus (Shekhem in Hebrew), Jericho, and, of course, Jerusalem are a vastly different story. Giving up Jewish control of these areas is a completely different matter from abandoning the small settlements that were once in Gaza.\nWhere Gaza had long been treated as a separate entity, and its settlements more remote, the West Bank\u2019s settlements are often indistinguishable to Israelis and visitors from Israel within its internationally recognized borders. The electric grid, water supply system, roads and economies of the established settlements are deeply integrated with Israel proper, and these days one can travel from Tel Aviv to many settlements and not realize you had left Israel\u2019s internationally recognized sovereign territory at all. The outposts and more remote settlements might be less integrated, but they also tend to be populated by the most fanatical and zealous of the settler population.\nIt is also rarely noted that many settlers have now been there for several generations. Granted, their presence is illegal, but not all settlers engage in violence or work to further displace Palestinians. Many feel, rightly or wrongly, that they are now rooted in their homes there. Others live, as Jews did in pre-Zionist days in Palestine, on the land for religious reasons and would rather remain there under Palestinian rule than leave.\nThese are not the people most of us think of when we think of settlers. And perhaps they are not very representative. But they are there. This should not in any way hinder the Palestinian struggle for their rights and their independence. But for both practical and ethical reasons we can afford to at least consider paths that might afford these people reasonable options for their future.\nStill, the settlement movement is a zealous, generally racist, colonialist movement. Whether from a secular or religious perspective, the movement is enthusiastic about not giving the proverbial \u201cone inch\u201d to the Palestinians, and the Israeli withdrawals from Gaza, Southern Lebanon, and a few settlements in the northern West Bank have only cemented in their minds the idea that these are self-destructive, futile, and, in some cases, sinful steps.\nThese factors would have made withdrawal from dozens of West Bank settlements a herculean task twenty years ago. In 2022, the massive costs in finance, in the reworking of Israeli infrastructure, and, most importantly, in the tsunami-like upheaval this would cause in Israeli society are well past the point where Israel can even be coerced into taking such steps. These costs would look to Israel like killing itself to live. And those costs are growing larger every day.\nA friend and colleague once said to me that the two-state solution is never completely impossible, but the cost just keeps getting higher. He was right, but even at the time, some five years ago, I argued that the cost was already more than anyone was going to be willing to pay. Now it is tantamount to a candy bar costing $100,000. It is simply not feasible that Israel would agree to this voluntarily, and the kind of pressure it would take to convince it otherwise is inconceivable. It is certainly much higher than mere sanctions, much less the BDS movement, could ever bring.\nLack of Political Will\nEven beyond material factors, there is simply no will for an actual two-state solution anymore. In 1993, when the Oslo Accords were signed, there was a significant appetite in Israel for withdrawing settlements from beyond the 1949 Armistice Lines. There was an understanding that Jerusalem would be a shared capital in some sense, and while this was a passionately contested view, it was also one that many Israelis supported.\nThose conditions have not existed for a long time. They were largely destroyed by the American and Israeli insistence on a summit in 2000 that the Palestinian president, Yasir Arafat, resisted. Many of the issues that needed to be considered had not yet been fully vetted in public debate by the Palestinians, whose leadership, unlike the Americans and Israelis, were not facing elections that year.\nAbandoning their promise not to blame Arafat if the summit failed, U.S. President Bill Clinton and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak disingenuously told their constituents that Arafat rejected an incredibly \u201cgenerous offer.\u201d The bloody Second Intifada came soon after.\nEven nearly two decades later, Israelis are understandably nervous because of these events. That is why there needs to be a strong incentive to do what is right; because that nervousness, whether rooted in genuine experience or in racism and a colonialist mindset, or both, exists in the hands of the only side in this \u201cconflict\u201d with power. The imbalance of power between Israel and the Palestinians is arguably the most fundamental cause of the occupation\u2019s apparent immortality.\nAnd on the Palestinian side? We have already seen that they are not going to accept a \u201csolution\u201d where they must give up Jerusalem. But that is just the most recent piece.\nThe Right of Return\nThere is a tacit assumption among Israelis and Americans that the Palestinians \u201cunderstand\u201d that a two-state solution would require that they surrender their pursuit of the right of return for Palestinian refugees forced out of the country in the wars of 1947\u201349 and 1967, and their descendants. I have argued for many years that this assumption is fatally flawed and that it needs to be reconsidered if there was ever to be a two-state, or any other, solution.\nAlong with Jerusalem, the right of return was the issue that Palestinians were most concerned over in the mid- and late-1990s. Many believed that Arafat was going to surrender the right of return, as this was of less concern to the Arab heads of state than Jerusalem was. Indeed, when I noted the fact that Arafat was not prepared for the Camp David II summit in 2000, the absence of serious discussion among the Palestinian public about the right of return was a major factor.\nPalestinians were aware of the Israeli view that the right of return was a red line. Israel was prepared to allow a token return of refugees. Numbers mentioned were something like 25,000 or even 50,000. Maybe they would go a little higher, but they were not going to acknowledge the principle of a guaranteed right for the millions of Palestinian refugees. So how was this to be resolved?\nI remember hearing from friends and colleagues in the West Bank as well as Palestinians I was working with in the U.S. about the fear that Arafat was going to give up the right of return. Palestinian activists started turning up the volume on the idea that the right of return was an individual as well as a national right, and that Arafat was not empowered to compromise it.\nWhile return has always been a fundamental part of Palestinian national culture since the naqba in 1947\u201349, this sentiment has only grown and hardened among Palestinians today. Moreover, they have little incentive to even consider compromising on this point, given that it is viewed as a right enshrined in international law, and, more importantly, that any compromise is an admission that they have no real connection to the land of Palestine and that Zionism was, in part or whole, justified in its objectives.\nSo why, many Palestinians argue, should they even consider compromise with an oppressive regime that has dispossessed them, denied them their rights, and showed such bad faith after their leader gave Israelis the recognition of their national rights that they said they required?\nAn Offer of Limited Sovereignty\nIt is hard to see a satisfactory answer to that question. And here is another one that is almost never considered. The Clinton Parameters stipulated that the Palestinian state would be \u201cnon-militarized.\u201d The state would give up its right to defend itself, with only a lightly armed security force meant to maintain internal order and, presumably, do similar work in thwarting militants that Palestinian security forces do now.\nSelf-defense is a key element of sovereignty, but more to the point, this stipulation means that the theoretical State of Palestine would be defenseless not only in what Israel refers to as a \u201ctough neighborhood\u201d but, worse, right next to the very state that held its people under an apartheid regime after colonizing their land and driving millions of Palestinians into life as refugees. The proposed state of Palestine would have to depend on an \u201cinternational force\u201d while sharing a border and cooperating with the regional military hegemon.\nThat does not seem very reasonable even under the conditions that existed twenty years ago, let alone under the current circumstances. Yet, since the Clinton Parameters were presented more than two decades ago, there has been no conversation around whether the Palestinian people \u2014 as distinct from the Palestinian President, Mahmoud Abbas, who has affirmed his acceptance of this abrogation of self-defense from time to time \u2014 accept this idea. It is difficult to imagine that it has anything close to consensus support among Palestinians, which could explain why there is a dearth of conversation about it.\nThere is no longer majority, much less consensus, support for a two-state solution among either Israeli Jews or Palestinians. Yet, as we saw in Speier\u2019s tweet, the only alternative to supporting it in Washington is to fully support Israeli apartheid. Other potential resolutions are simply out of bounds, even if they are routinely discussed in media, think tanks, and similar venues.\nThere is also no current path to a two-state solution, either politically or practically. John Kerry, who is among the most zealous of supporter of two states, in and out of the U.S. government, for years warned that the \u201cwindow was closing.\u201d Palestinian lawmaker and intellectual Hanan Ashrawi said in 2014 that the opportunity for a two-state solution \u201cis disappearing before our eyes.\u201d At some point, it must stop being a prediction and happen. And so it has.\nIndeed, Kerry, when he was Secretary of State, said that the possibility of a two-state solution had \u201ca year-and-a-half, maybe two\u201d of life left to it. That was in 2013. J Street, perhaps the leading proponent group for a two-state solution, wrote in September 2010, \u201cWhile the majority of both the Israeli and Palestinian peoples continue to support a two-state solution, ongoing developments, expanding settlements, and a growing movement in support of a one-state outcome suggest that window of opportunity is rapidly closing.\u201d\nThose conditions have only accelerated over the past eleven years, and Kerry and J Street were right. If anything, they were already looking at the possibility of a two-state solution with rose-colored glasses, but now, all these years later, to deny that the conditions J Street named have made the two-state solution unfeasible is to deny the most obvious reality. It is as absurd as climate denial and flies in the face of the facts at hand.\nThe Fig Leaf\nInstead of being a realistic solution, support for the two-state solution is often a tool used by centrists, moderates, and liberals to tacitly support apartheid while seeming to support peace. An example of this occurred back in October, when members of the New York City chapter of Jewish Voice for Peace approached Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and old him that they represented New York Jews who demanded that he use his position to stop the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians. Schumer simply said, \u201cI support a two-state solution\u201d and refused to engage any further or address the point that was raised to him.\nSchumer demonstrated that the two-state solution has become nothing more than a dodge, a way to avoid doing anything to change the status quo but expressing an abstract desire to see it change. That leaves us in a hopeless place if the two-state solution is the only permissible option.\nWe can no longer stand by and allow, for example, Republicans, who have formally abandoned the two-state solution, to call the lone Palestinian woman in Congress, Rep. Rashida Tlaib, an antisemite for daring to support a solution of one secular, democratic state for all Israelis and Palestinians. Somehow, it is antisemitic to even posit the idea that a form of government that we ourselves employ and is the standard through much of the western world, is appropriate for Israelis and Palestinians.\nMany of the two-state solution\u2019s most sincere proponents insist that it must be the only option on the table even while they must be aware that the practical possibility of a two-state solution has disappeared.\nRep. Andy Levin introduced a bill in 2021 to take some very positive steps toward a two-state solution. It advocates \u201crobust\u201d monitoring of security assistance to Israel, clarifies the distinction between Israel and the West Bank, creates a method for finally removing the \u201cterror group\u201d designation from the PLO, and other positive provisions.\nBut the bill\u2019s very first statement of policy is to cement the two-state approach as the only possible path for U.S. policy.\nLevin touted his bill as being supported by \u201cAmeinu, Americans for Peace Now, Foreign Policy for America, J Street and Partners for Progressive Israel.\u201d Those are good groups, but they are also all, with exception of Foreign Policy for America, Jewish groups. No Arab, Muslim, much less Palestinian, group endorses Levin\u2019s bill. Without the endorsement of Palestinian groups, the bill cannot be an ingredient for a real resolution, especially given that one of the principles Washington repeatedly states is that the parties must not be pressured into an agreement.\nHistorically, that prohibition on significant pressure has only applied to pressure on Israel, and this is one of the fundamental reasons for American failure. Unfortunately, the groups supporting Levin\u2019s bill \u2014 all of whom have the best of intentions within their own framework, and this should not be doubted \u2014 are representative of only one branch of this conflict, the Israeli side.\nThis is the nub of the issue. There is nothing wrong with J Street, Americans for Peace Now, and their fellow groups pursuing what they see as the best path for ending the occupation and creating a just future for everyone living between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea. They are often attacked for criticizing Israel from their own communities. They believe sincerely that the two-state solution can bring a better future for all Israelis and Palestinians.\nBut while these groups also speak out against Israel\u2019s occupation and at least some of its human rights abuses, there are other pro-Israel groups who claim to support a two-state solution, or at least use the two-state rhetoric, but are clearly hostile to the rights of Palestinians. Groups like AIPAC, the American Jewish Committee (AJC), the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), and other groups are among those who speak of a two-state solution in the abstract but defend every Israeli crime and infringement on Palestinian rights that undermines that possibility.\nEven more extreme groups claim at times to support the two-state solution. About ten years ago, I published an article for a progressive Jewish magazine where I stated that Pastor John Hagee of Christians United for Israel (CUFI), a fanatical, apocalyptic Christian Zionist group was opposed to a two-state solution. This elicited a furious response from CUFI\u2019s lawyer who insisted that Hagee supported two states and threatened to sue if the statement was not retracted (I refused, of course).\nEven if the two-state solution were not being used so cynically, it would still be illegitimate for it to be the only possible policy the United States could consider. It has been battered, bruised, and overtaken by history. Its initial flaws have all been exposed and magnified, and its potential appeal has been badly diminished.\nNone of this means that adherents of the two-state solution cannot or should not zealously advocate for their position. They absolutely should. The conflict born out of Zionist colonization has gone on for well over a century and shows no sign of abating. It must be ended, and every idea that can bring about that end should be considered. It is long past time to open the conversation beyond, but not excluding, the two-state solution.\nMitchell Plitnick, a political analyst and writer, is the president of ReThinking Foreign Policy.

(coming soon)\nPart 5: What Is Liberalism? (coming soon)\nThe traditional conception of the political spectrum has been confusing. Some have tried to exploit that confusion to push their own agendas, such as the dual axis political spectrum suggested by political libertarianism. This marketing fake has fooled some people, and it needs to be debunked.\nThe Dual Axis\nThe dual axis attempts to replace the traditional political spectrum by portraying political psychology along an XY chart. One axis stands for left-right and the other reflecting some other sentiment, most commonly labeled as \u201cauthoritarian-democratic\u201d or \u201cauthoritarian-libertarian.\u201d\nMy strong tendency as a philosopher is to acknowledge that issues are more multidimensional than currently viewed. The dual-axis chart, however, obfuscates the discussion of political orientation by creating a false dimension. It was invented in 1969 by libertarian activist David Nolan as a marketing ploy to sell libertarian ideology.\nNolan\u2019s Chart, the original commercial (source: public domain)\nNolan created a diamond-shaped XY chart with one axis suggesting economic freedom and the other axis suggesting social freedom with political libertarianism at the top as though it was divine grace handed down from heaven. Classic marketing technique to put top and center what you want the observer to prefer. Added are the arrows pointing upward to greater freedom, and who wouldn\u2019t want greater freedom? The dual-axis diamond, or Nolan Chart, has been used by libertarian groups and even libertarian political parties as a recruiting tool.\nStripped of the marketing manipulation, the chart is portrayed as having a standard XY chart with two axes with various labeling: frequently forms of the economic and the personal.\nEysenck Chart\nThere are multiple problems with the dual-axis chart, the main one being, as mentioned earlier, its creation of a false dimension. As I explained in Part 1, the left-right political spectrum reflects the distribution of power in society. Nolan\u2019s original chart took that grain of truth and oversimplified it into the bromide of \u201cfreedom,\u201d Then, he artificially split personal and economic freedom into separate axes to obscure the central truth that the left-right axis is the concentration of versus the circulation of power. The various versions based on Nolan\u2019s original chart are variations on these two oversimplifications.\nThe Dual Axis Debunked\nThe dual-axis political spectrum, however construed, quickly collapses under analysis into the single-axis spectrum of concentration of power. The authoritarian-democratic axis is the right-left axis. The greater concentration of power is the greater concentration of freedom into a small number of people. In the Eysenck version above, yes, greater democratic participation is liberal. But that means that greater authoritarianism is conservative. It is dishonest to offset conservatism as though it is not on the authoritarian-democratic axis.\nDishonest subterfuge infuses all versions of the libertarian dual axis chart. There are three main areas of subterfuge in the dual axis. One is an artificial separation of economic issues from social issues. This is central to Nolan\u2019s original chart and is often copied by followers. It is an attempt to mask the reality that economic power is inextricably intertwined with social power. Whoever has the gold makes the rules, is an old saying, and still true.\nThe second, and related to the first, is the artificial separation of state power concentrations from non-state power concentrations. Take for example, this version.\nStradiotto Chart\nStructure is what matters not who or what is at the top of the structure. State control and ownership (they are the same, of course) is a concentration of power and is right-wing. But so are control and ownership by an individual, an aristocracy, or a corporate oligarchy. It is factually misleading and politically dishonest to portray \u201cprivate ownership\u201d as a panacea in opposition to \u201cstate ownership.\u201d Both are subject to concentration of power. Whether a small community or a large nation, concentrations of power function similarly. If a small settlement in a dry area has only one source of water that is privately owned, then that individual has control over that resource. That private individual can leverage that control and ownership to limit the personal and economic freedom of others. If a corporation buys all of the water rights in a region, then the corporation can leverage that control and ownership to limit the personal and economic freedom of others. There is no dichotomy between \u201cstate ownership\u201d and \u201cprivate ownership.\u201d The issue is power concentration \u2014 the left-right spectrum as I discussed in Part 1.\nWhy does the libertarian dual-axis chart try to hide these realities? What are libertarians who use the chart trying to hide?\nWhere Libertarianism Is on the Political Spectrum\nPolitical libertarians try to push the false dimension in the dual-axis spectrum as an argument prop to differentiate their ideology from more traditional right-wing ideologies. Increasing power concentration is the definition of increasingly right-wing. Again, it does not matter in who or what the power is concentrated. Libertarians ignore this reality and create the subterfuge that they are outside the left-right spectrum and hide that they are, in fact, right-wing. Here is another example.\nA typical fake axis chart c. 2020 (Public Domain)\n\u201cAuthoritarian Left\u201d is a logical contradiction equivalent to calling a shape a \u201cround square.\u201d There is an \u201cAuthoritarian Right,\u201d equivalent to calling a shape a \u201cround circle.\u201d Authoritarian structures are right-wing by definition. A totalitarian government, a company town, an anarchic warlord/gang leader, and an oligarchic business syndicate are all examples of the Authoritarian Right because they all share the same structure of power concentrated in the hands of the few.\nSo then, is there a \u201cLibertarian Left\u201d as the last dual axis chart suggests? The perhaps surprising answer is, \u201cno.\u201d Greater circulation of power increases personal and economic freedom \u2014 that is the definition of left-wing. However, a third subterfuge of the libertarian marketing scheme is to pretend that libertarianism itself lies along a left-right spectrum. Not all forms of \u201cliberty\u201d are a greater circulation of freedom. The dictator has the liberty to take away other people\u2019s freedoms. A warlord/gang leader has the liberty to oppress others. These are the narrow liberties to which political libertarianism leads, and its basic assumptions mean it is inherently right-wing in its drive for concentration, not circulation, of \u201cliberty.\u201d\nLibertarian ideology rests on the mistake of presuming that governance is violence. This explains why most all versions of the deal axis chart portray government or the state as being a negative to overcome. Nolan\u2019s original chart set that tone of declaring \u201cthe state\u201d as the worst and libertarianism as the best. Political libertarianism is an extreme opposition to government to bring about a particular form of power concentration.\nA central fallacy of Libertarianism is the assumption that ending the rule of law would lead to utopia rather than a Hobbesian \u201cstate of nature.\u201d It is the child\u2019s fantasy of \u201cif there were no rules, I could do whatever I want and I will be happy.\u201d As I asked earlier, who doesn\u2019t want more freedom? But libertarians fundamentally misunderstand the nature of freedom, something I explained in depth in an earlier article. They do not understand that freedom is a dynamic among people, and they focus on the perceived tyrannies of negative freedoms of governance, whether social norms or legal proscriptions. They, therefore, cannot understand that some restrictions on human behavior are necessary to create more freedom. That is not a paradox. That is the nature of freedom in all aspects of life. Eliminating the state will not ultimately lead to more freedom. It would lead only to greater tyranny, as can be easily demonstrated.\nBy falsely declaring that governance is violence, the libertarian claims that all sovereignty should lie in the individual. Society, if it even makes sense to call it that in this context, is then a jumble of monads \u2014 individuals disconnected from each other and collective action. In this anarchic situation, the libertarian or anarchist, like a totalitarian leader of a state, is immune from criticism and devoid of responsibilities and accountability to others. It is an empty and false view of freedom. In reality, freedom is a dynamic among people; freedom is never not contingent upon other people unless you live in a cave far, far away. We live in a shared reality, a society in which cooperation and mutual recognition is essential to freedom.\nLibertarianism ignores all of these realities in favor of its \u201cif only there were no rules\u201d fantasy of solipsistic autonomy. In this way, political libertarianism is right-wing because it would inexorably result in a \u201cmight makes right\u201d anarchical concentration of power, both economic and social, in the hands of a few strongmen who, without any social structure to circulate power, would be free to be autocratic oppressors. This is the anarchy of what Hobbes called the \u201cstate of nature,\u201d that he properly condemned as nasty and brutish. There will always be the active potential for people to abuse power; therefore, libertarianism and anarchism are absurd to pretend that we have no need for social mechanisms to limit abuses of power. The dual axis scheme attempts to distract from this absurdity by creating a false dimension.\nIn conclusion, marketing political libertarianism in terms of the dual-axis spectrum is ultimately the attempt to hide the truth that political libertarianism is an anti-social anarchism that inexorably leads to a totalitarianism of the individual. That extreme concentration of power of might makes right is what some libertarians want. Libertarian ideology is right-wing, and its dual-axis marketing scheme is a fundamentally dishonest subterfuge whose intrinsic falsehoods have tricked some people since it was fabricated in 1969. Search on \u201cdual axis political spectrum\u201d and you will find some wacky and way over-complicated versions, each trying to solve the inherent contradictions of the dual axis. The real solution is to acknowledge the reality that there is one political spectrum defined by power concentration. Left-wing is a greater circulation of power, and right-wing is greater concentration of power. Political libertarianism inexorably leads to a greater concentration of power and is therefore right-wing, a fact that the fake dual axis cannot hide.", "comment_count": 10, "like_count": 207, "created_time": 1651411361512, "comment": [{"user_id": "c6380754b064", "comment_time": 1651411361512, "comment": "Thank you for sharing!"}, {"user_id": "5111ea73f4bc", "comment_time": 1651458660766, "comment": "Thanks for this analysis.

Inserting the principles of philosophy into real life.\nWelcome to part three of my series of podcasts on the concept of recognition, a very important concept in philosophy. In this podcast, I want to talk as promised about some of the history of the concept of recognition, and how recognition of our fellow human beings is essential to justice itself.\nRecognition is something that is, it\u2019s not something that anyone invented. It is something that is at the very center of the fabric of society. And philosophers have only relatively recently begun talking about the importance of recognition in social justice. Still not enough people in my opinion, including philosophers, are aware of this important social reality.\nRecognition involves the attitudes and practices by which we approve and affirm each other. We recognize another as a human being deserving of consideration as a good person or as a friend. We also recognize misbehavior and appropriately disapprove of it. How we function socially is shaped by norms of behavior, and we use those norms to recognize others and their behaviors. Most importantly, recognition is the core of human rights. There is no justice without the recognition that someone deserves justice.\n\nRousseau and the First Discussions of Recognition\nSo, I\u2019m going to talk about three philosophers who in history have helped develop the understanding of the concept of recognition. The first was the French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who lived in the 1700s. He was a radical social philosopher and fierce critic of social conventions. The quick version of Rousseau\u2019s philosophy is summed up in his book The Social Contract.\nMan is Born Free and everywhere is in chains. One thinks himself the master of others, and so remains a greater slave than they. How did this change come about? I do not know what can make it legitimate that question. I think I can answer. But the social order is a sacred right, which is the basis of all other rights. Nevertheless, this right does not come from nature, and must therefore be founded on conventions.\nThat\u2019s from Rousseau\u2019s book, The Social Contract part one, chapter one.\nBy the social order, Rousseau meant the class structure of society, and the many related expectations of how people should behave. France was a hierarchical society in Rousseau\u2019s time: a king, an aristocracy, and the common people. Everyone knew their place in the hierarchy because social recognition norms taught people what was expected from them and what to expect from others.\nThat set of social relations was what made France a civilized society, but Rousseau saw civilized society as a prison. Its structure of social norms chained people, restricting their true expression. Rousseau complained that social norms encouraged people to obsessively concentrate on the approval of others to maintain their social status.\nThis social pressure created in people the artificial state of amour-propre. Rousseau picked up the concept of amour-propre, literally \u201cself-love,\u201d from the French moralist Fran\u00e7ois VI, Duc de La Rochefoucauld.\nFran\u00e7ois, a contemporary of Descartes, was also raised on the theory of letters, the ancient sources, and Francois was familiar with Augustine, who had condemned this love of self, amour de soi, as the vice of making oneself more important than God. Francois added to Augustine\u2019s amour de soi the idea that motivated by love of self, people seek the approval of others. We are in fact so desirous of the approval of others that we put up a public front to cast ourselves in a flattering light, highlighting our positives and hiding our negatives in order to win other people\u2019s approval.\nBeing familiar with the French Royal Court, he was, after all, a Duke, Fran\u00e7ois saw how courtiers would go to great lengths to gain prestige and status. This pursuit, despite being motivated by self-interest, actually causes people to forget their true nature and misjudge their own behaviors. Fran\u00e7ois wrote that we are so used to disguising ourselves from others that we end up disguising ourselves from ourselves. This desire for esteem that Fran\u00e7ois terms, amour-propre, helps him explain why we behave as we do and why we are blind to why we behave as we do.\nRousseau took the concept further and defined amour-propre as approval and esteem that must come from others. This, he argued was not natural self-love or amour de soi, which Rousseau, in sharp contrast to Augustine, saw as positive. Rousseau claimed that amour-propre was an artificial creation of civilization that caused individuals to compare themselves with one another to gain social status. He claimed that amour de soi was compatible with happiness, but that amour-propre corrupted individuals and led to misery and vice.\nRousseau saw amour de soi as difficult, if not impossible, within civilized society, which is dominated by the pressure to conform to social norms. So, in essence, what Rousseau is saying in his condemnation of society is that the recognition norms that demand us to act in terms of amour-propre prevent us from acting according to our true nature, which equates with amour de soi.\n\nHegel and Recognition\nMove ahead a few years and to a different country. German philosopher George Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel is best known for his idealist system of social philosophy. But he also developed the concept of recognition into a formal philosophical tool.\nHegel uses a German word anerkennung that does not have an exact match in English but is translated as recognition.\u201d In recognition in English, recognition has two meanings to identify something such as. I recognize that object is a tree which is erkennen in German, but also to acknowledge value and respect something. I recognize you as a student, or I recognize you as a good person, or I recognize you as a human being and treat you as a human being deserves to be treated, which is anerkennung in German.\nIt is this latter definition to respect and value something that is the sense that Hegel means and uses. Hegel realized that recognition is crucial in social life. You are defined by your relations with others to have successful healthy relations with others you need the acknowledgement and approval of others. Hegel realized that we are all dependent on recognition from other people.\nThink about any label or idea by which you can identify yourself. Friend, student, citizen and so on. You cannot meaningfully be that, any of those things, unless others acknowledge you as that. Therefore, you are dependent on them for your identity. You are not a friend unless someone recognizes you as a friend. You cannot say, \u201cI am a student at State University.\u201d unless the university recognizes you as such. You are not a citizen of a country unless that country legally recognizes you as one.\nEvery single relation you have, every social identity you have has a similar requirement. This includes even simple things like being a nice person or being attractive. You are not such unless others think you are. That is why we stress out so much about how we appear to others. The positive side of recognition is that when we receive it, we become part of a community.\nThe negative side of recognition is that because people need it, they compete for it. Rousseau discussed how people become obsessed with the need for approval and recognition from others. This obsession drives them to act according to how society tells them to act, and people end up being untrue to themselves in order to curry favor with others.\nHegel doesn\u2019t share Rousseau\u2019s anti society position. Hegel sees social norms as positives. We are members of a society, and that society has a system of social norms that inform people how to act and how to treat others. When we act in accordance with those norms, we receive recognition from others, including social authority.\nHegel believed that recognition is essential for providing the conditions under which individual people can form an identity. Hegel said that an individual develops as a person through the guidance of recognition norms. Through our actions, some successful, some not so, we receive approval and disapproval, and we learn how to behave and be a part of our society. Recognition also gives us social roles and responsibilities by which we come to self-realization of who we are as a passionate individual and member of our society.\nHegel says that recognition is the means by which we actualize our various freedoms through becoming a good member of our social community and of society as a whole. Hegel does acknowledge that recognition can be a negative burden. His position is that recognition is more of a problem in interpersonal relations. Because we are defined by others and need recognition from them to know how we are and thus become autonomous.\nHegel thought that we will fight against another person to affirm our own freedom by proving that our status is of more importance than the other person\u2019s. We are trying to express our autonomy through elevating ourselves over another. But this conflict cannot achieve the mutual recognition that is essential to our autonomy. Remember, we depend on others for our own identity, and for our acceptance in society, and that recognition has to be mutual. That I recognize you as someone that has enough social authority to make a proper judgment on me as being a friend, a student, a citizen, et cetera. Mutual recognition is essential to our own autonomy. We are defined by how we are perceived.\nHegel\u2019s brutal example of this is the master-slave relation, which needs to be interpreted more as an analogy than as a literal state. Someone is a master only if a slave acknowledges that mastery. So, Hegel says, the master is actually dependent on the slave for his own autonomous identity. This creates a conflict that neither person can ever win. In Hegel\u2019s harsh assessment, the conflict ends only when one of them dies. The master-slave analogy illustrates that the irony of freedom is that we cannot be free except in terms of our relations with others and our place in a society.\n\nHonneth and Recognition\nThe theory of recognition based on Hegel\u2019s ideas became a topic in social philosophy in the late 2000s. Thanks to Axel Honneth. Honneth is another German philosopher still alive today, still working today. He takes on the mission of critiquing society to bring about human emancipation from injustice. His distinctive approach to critical theory is to replace Marxism as the center of the critical project with Hegel\u2019s theory of recognition. This enables Honneth to talk about how social institutions affect people positively and negatively, and what causes people to demand justice. Honneth\u2019s hypothesis is that all social integration depends on reliable forms of mutual recognition.\nThere are two keys to Honneth\u2019s conception of recognition. The first is that individuals are socialized into a life world of recognition norms that prescribe how we should respond to people\u2019s behaviors. Social norms inform us about what behaviors are worthy of praise or censure in others, and in ourselves. They tell us what is expected of us, from moral behavior to social niceties, creating shared communal bonds.\nThe second is that receiving recognition on the basis of these norms enables an individual to develop a positive \u201crelation-to-self\u201d; his or her sense of place in society; and, most importantly, his or her autonomy to be able to determine and realize his or her own desires and intentions freely. Thus, individuals desire and need to both receive and give recognition to achieve their goals in society. When we receive recognition and enter into relations of mutual recognition with others, we develop an identity.\nHonneth takes the usual definitions of injustice as violations of laws or rights and expands it to the idea that people experience moral injuries when recognition is lacking, or an individual is actively misrecognized. In his 2007 book, Disrespect, he says that Misrecognition is an active withholding of recognition, such as denying rights or refusing social inclusion.\nExclusion, insult, and degradation violate and damage one\u2019s self confidence, their self-respect, and self-esteem. These injuries to one\u2019s integrity, honor or dignity Honneth, argues, are the core of the experience of injustice. People learn what justice is through processes of socialization. They come to expect the society will recognize them in accordance with social recognition norms of just treatment.\nWhen instead they receive misrecognition, people experience the resulting disappointment as violence to their sense of identity. Honneth view of justice extends beyond capitalist exploitation, oppressive laws, or unequal distribution of resources to receiving exclusion, insult or degradation.\nIn his 2003 book, The Struggle of Recognition, the Moral Grammar of Social Conflicts, Honneth states that most social movements for justice are in fact struggles for recognition. Even social conflicts over resources or political power are at their heart struggles based on the concern that moral values are not being reflected in actual recognition relations. Groups denied rights or integrity seek to reestablish relations of mutual recognition.\nWe can see a recent example of Honneth\u2019s idea in the Black Lives Matter movement. Yes, this group is struggling for legal rights, but at the heart of their movement is the struggle for recognition that they are human beings who deserve to be treated according to the moral values that society claims it believes in but is not fully extending to Black people.\nThat denial of recognition of Black people is what Honneth calls a pathology of reason. It should be obvious that blacks are people with the same rights as other people. However, society has distorted people\u2019s ability to reason about moral relations and norms, leading to a failure to identify misrecognition.\nWhen individuals experience misrecognition Honneth says their suffering motivates them to take action. Their damaged self-esteem and relation to self can be repaired only by recognition. They therefore join an existing political movement that is struggling for recognition. Honneth also sees large scale political movements as necessary to motivate an individual to take on a struggle for recognition.\nNow this position leaves him unable to explain how such movements ever get started. If you can only struggle for recognition within an existing political movement, then how does it ever get off the ground? But that\u2019s my pet peeve about Honneth theory.\nBut his theory also can\u2019t explain how a person damaged by missed recognition could manage to resolve the struggle for recognition, or why many people who suffer from recognition don\u2019t enter into a struggle for recognition. Again, another pet peeve of mine about honest theory. I wrote a book about that, but that\u2019s another story.\nAlso, Honneth\u2019s reliance on a Hegelian view of society as merely being institutional spheres of family, civil society, and the state leave him unable to recognize the myriad ways that individuals respond to experiences of misrecognition outside of institutional paths. Despite the shortcomings of Honneth\u2019s version of recognition theory, he has established recognition as a social reality that political philosophers need to address. A great deal more work needs to be done on recognition in order for us to truly understand how deeply entwined it is within society, and to use this realization of our dependence on mutual recognition to work for greater social justice for everyone.", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 0, "created_time": 1651145966291, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Philosophy", "Politics", "Personal Development", "Social Justice", "Social"]}, {"author": "Douglas Giles, PhD", "post_id": "f69f337fd10d", "user_id": "c6380754b064", "title": "Both Tyranny and Justice Depend on Recognition", "content": "Both Tyranny and Justice Depend on Recognition\nAbout villains, henchmen, dictatorships, and patriotism.\nPart of my series on Recognition.\nA Concept Little-Known Outside Academic Philosophy May Be The Key To Social Justice\nThe UK recently observed the 100th anniversary of women gaining the right to vote and the US will reach the century\u2026medium.com\nWhy Ukrainians but not Syrians?\nText transcript of my recent podcast responding to Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukrainemedium.com\nThe Authority to Claim Recognition\nSocial recognition among individuals and groups is what keeps together communities. Without it, struggles for justice\u2026medium.com\nWhen I was young, I would watch various films and TV shows that had villains and their henchmen and I would wonder about these henchmen. Why were they following this villain\u2019s instructions? Why were they loyal to a bad person who ordered them to do immoral things?\nLoyalty is generally considered to be a noble trait, such as being loyal to one\u2019s friend and family. A subordinate\u2019s loyalty to a good leader is a moral good. It seems, however, difficult to justify loyalty to a poor leader or a morally corrupt leader.\nThere is a need for moral discernment \u2014 being able to distinguish between moral and immoral leaders \u2014 especially because either way, loyalty is a matter of recognition. The henchmen following the villain and the sidekicks following the hero are both practicing recognition.\nRecognition, as I observed in earlier episodes, is valuing another person or trait a person can possess. You are not a leader unless and until others recognize you as one. You have no authority unless people respect that you have authority. Hegel understood that as the first philosopher of recognition: the master is dependent on the recognition of the servant as being the master.\nVillains, both in stories and in real life, aren\u2019t leaders unless they are recognized by followers as leaders. The same for good leaders. Followers recognize a leader as a leader for various reasons, some noble, others not. People won\u2019t follow your directions unless they think doing so is a good idea. You have to give them an incentive to follow you and your instructions.\nOne incentive is fear; people follow a leader because of fear of the penalties for disobedience. Machiavelli claimed that it is better for people to fear you than to love you. Fear is an incentive to obey a villainous leader, a truth that gang leaders and dictators have proven. How successful fear is in the long-term is debatable, but before anyone can get to a point where they can control others through fear, they must first achieve enough power to make fear an option. Even the worst dictators did not win power through threats alone. They first gained followers, henchmen, through other incentives.\nThe Henchmen Hypothesis\nWhat is required for political power? Consider Russia\u2019s current leader, Vladimir Putin. He is a Machiavellian leader who is feared more than loved. But why is he feared? He is, not to be impolite, a small, sick old man who is no physical threat to anyone. Putin rules with an iron hand not because he is a threat to anyone, but because his security forces are. And by security forces, we mean henchmen.\nHenchmen are necessary for power and to have henchmen, recognition of the leader is necessary. To a degree, in a totalitarian structure like Putin\u2019s dictatorship, everyone is afraid of everyone else as a potential threat. The Soviet Union was highly adept at inculcating a sense that anyone, anywhere could be an informant. Putin is a product of that lifeworld and he has re-established it in Russia.\nSuch pervasive fear cannot be maintained without people willing to enact repercussions for disloyalty to Putin\u2019s regime. It is fair to say that Putin is responsible for the oppression in Russia, but only because a large group of henchmen recognize his authority and are willing to inflict the oppression.\nThat circles back to the question of henchmen that first occurred to me as a kid. Why follow and obey a villain? I think much of it has to do with the idolization of power. Some people are impressed by strength, and some people enjoy being a part of a power structure. Any strongman starts out by being recognized by others as someone with the strength to become the leader of a power structure. Henchmen will join forces with a potential leader if they believe that through assisting that person, they will become part of that power structure. As the strongman gains more followers and thus more power, more and more people will join it who are attracted to power and the lure of being a part of the power structure.\nThe gang leader or warlord has henchmen who enjoy being part of a group that dominates others. They recognize their leader as one who has power and authority, though mostly, they recognize that leader as someone who gives them what they want: being a part of something powerful.\nRecognition, again, is valuing something or someone. A very important human need is to feel valued, to feel recognized as a part of something. This is why, as I discussed in an earlier episode, recognition is essential to social justice. When people are recognized as a part of the community, they are treated well as a person deserves, and they feel the positive value of being included in the community. Justice requires the positive recognition of valuing other people as people, of including them.\nPeople have a basic human need for inclusion recognition \u2014 to be part of a community, and this can be exploited. Cults and gangs also offer recognition as part of a community, though that community is also defined through its exclusion of others. The promise of belonging is a key recruitment technique for cults and gangs, \u201cyou can be one of us if you recognize the authority of the leader.\u201d As long as you recognize the leader as the leader, you receive the social benefits of inclusion recognition. When a leader orders acts of violence against non-members of the gang, some henchmen may enjoy committing those violent acts, but others may go along to retain the benefits of inclusion in the gang.\nInclusion recognition is the social glue that forms and binds communities for good and for ill. It works for social clubs, subcultures, and even nations. Obviously scale and content differ among a bridge club, a street gang, a celebrity\u2019s fan club, and a dictatorship, but the central dynamic of recognition is the same. People want to be a part of a community. They want the recognition that being part of a group brings.\nThis helps explain why henchmen will follow a villain. In simplest terms \u2014 they enjoy it, they receive social and personal benefits from it. Maybe they like the feeling of power that comes from being told to commit violent acts. Most likely, they like the feeling of being part of a power structure \u2014 a kind of community. Their loyalty is slightly self-serving.\nA dictator like Putin can rule because his power structure benefits the people who follow him. There are financial incentives, to be sure, but there are also the recognition incentives of inclusion recognition among his henchmen in the security services. Again, a leader has no authority unless people recognize that authority. Everyone in Russia could deny Putin recognition and ignore his orders. It is not Putin himself that is the obstacle to disobeying him. The obstacle is his henchmen who receive a sense of self-worth from being henchmen in a power structure.\nThe Appeal to Patriotism\nRecognition being the glue that binds communities also works at a national level. All that has been discussed so far about loyalty and recognition applies to loyalty to one\u2019s country. Pride in where one lives is a natural human sentiment and patriotism is a moral good when it is pride in and loyalty to where one lives. One can have patriotic pride in one\u2019s neighborhood, one\u2019s city, and one\u2019s state or region, but patriotism is mostly thought of in terms of loyalty to one\u2019s country.\nIt is expected that people would fight to defend their country from invaders. Such self-defense is a moral good and appropriately considered as patriotic. Asking people to defend their homeland is one thing, but patriotism is also used as an appeal to obey one\u2019s country when it launches offensive actions against another country. When the United States invaded Iraq (both times), its citizens were supposed to support the invasion and occupation. People against the invasion were accused of a lack of patriotism. The same is the case in Russia today. Citizens are expected to support the invasion of Ukraine. People against the invasion are accused of a lack of patriotism and denied recognition by the country\u2019s power structure.\nPutin can clamp down on resistance to the invasion of Ukraine because the power structure has henchmen who will willingly commit acts of repression. Maybe they enjoy roughing up protestors, but more likely, they enjoy the recognition they receive from being part of the power structure. That recognition includes being called patriots for defending the country from so-called subversives.\nRecognition also explains why henchmen are willing to follow immoral orders. Of course, a lack of moral discernment is at work, but it is easier to put moral considerations aside when you are recognized as part of a power structure. It isn\u2019t just peer pressure, it is positive reinforcement that it is good and proper to obey orders \u2014 patriotism and loyalty you know.\nHannah Arendt wrote about blind patriotic obedience in her book The Origins of Totalitarianism. The banality of evil is when recognition from the power structure brings normalcy to otherwise immoral acts. Nazi henchmen like Adolf Eichmann did his job, for which he received recognition. For him, that was enough. He did not think further. He was a henchmen willing to follow orders. Even though those orders came from villains.\nRecognition is paradoxically a motivator for both moral and immoral acts. Recognition is what brings people together, affirming them as valued members of a community. But if that community is a power structure that misrecognizes people outside of the community, then it can value henchmen who commit villainous acts, giving them recognition that will encourage them to remain loyalty to the villain leading the power structure of the community. To ensure justice and reduce injustices, we need to consider the important role that recognition plays in human society and how some social structures can abuse the power of recognition.\n(Source: Piqsels)", "comment_count": 1, "like_count": 13, "created_time": 1651092457621, "comment": [{"user_id": "c6380754b064", "comment_time": 1651092457621, "comment": "Thank you for sharing!"}, {"user_id": "1328ea3d38bd", "comment_time": 1651115999214, "comment": "It is unclear to me what your reason is in writing this.

They would be solid, respectable folk who did not waste their time chasing rainbows or building castles in the air. My well-nurtured children would grow up to be steady and even-tempered, unlike the people in my family \u2014 all of whom were prone to flights of ecstasy or irritability and bouts of bone-crushing despair.\nInstead, I raised artists and architects. One is a financial analyst, but Michael arrived at that career along a convoluted path involving a period when he dyed his beautiful wheat-colored hair black, complemented by black fingernails and a black wardrobe. He was only 13. When I took Michael to the pediatrician, kindly Dr. Mayer eyed him with concern and announced, \u201cI think he\u2019s depressed.\u201d A portly child psychologist concurred, adding that my boy was very creative. The bad times were part of that complicated package, he announced.\nThis is an awkward way of segueing into the story of my Grandfather Gordon, my mother\u2019s father. On Daddy\u2019s side I had an aunt and an uncle and a mob of cousins. We had family reunions where I met several generations of Whites, some so distant I needed a chart to figure out the relationship. I called them the \u201cgood ol\u2019 boy\u201d branch of the family because they were easy-going, beer-guzzling coaches and insurance salesmen.\nGrandpa Gordon, however, was a cipher, a man with a face smiling back from black-and-white photos but no history or family or cohesive narrative. In his photos he is handsome like a movie star, with a long face, perfectly symmetrical features, a strong chin, and a half-smile. He has dark hair, and thick dark eyebrows that curve over a perfectly straight, sculpted nose.\nMen contribute the seed to make a child and then they are gone. But here\u2019s the thing: they aren\u2019t really gone.\nThe summer after fourth grade, my mother went to stay with her grandmother deep in the Missouri Ozarks. When she came home, Grandpa Gordon was gone. She saw him only once or twice again in her life. He was a truck driver, and somewhere I heard the story that he kept a girlfriend on the other end of his route. Somewhere I heard another story that my grandmother nursed a black eye on the day she kicked him out. I don\u2019t know if those stories are true. My mother has no such memories \u2014 at least she doesn\u2019t admit to them \u2014 and Larry Gordon isn\u2019t around to defend himself.\nHe drifted west, acquiring two more wives and a son who died many years ago, so far as I can determine. One of those wives supposedly packed up everything and left during the day when Larry was at work, leaving only a set of encyclopedias. Apparently Larry Gordon wasn\u2019t very good with women, despite his handsome looks, and I guess he drank. When murdered farm workers were dug up on a California ranch in the 1970s, my grandmother fretted he might be among them.\nBecause my mother was an only child, I didn\u2019t have any Gordon cousins or aunts and uncles. My great aunt, Larry\u2019s older sister, lived in my Kansas hometown, but she wouldn\u2019t talk about the Gordons. Nobody would talk about the Gordons.\nThis is the sort of story that is so common today. Men contribute the seed to make a child and then they are gone. But here\u2019s the thing: they aren\u2019t really gone. Over the years, I have pieced together tattered scraps to make a story. As I have discovered a gnarled family tree, I have come to realize that this absent man, this phantom who might never have taken form except for my tenacious curiosity, contributed a great deal to the person that I am. A great deal to all of us, in fact.\nA lifetime ago, my brother Bruce was a noted wildlife sculptor and expert on carousel horses. A self-taught artist, he carved the originals and created the molds for the signature carousel horses that once decorated Applebee\u2019s Neighborhood Grills, with his work shipped all over the country and to several foreign countries. He created a line of carousel animals representing endangered species, including a gorilla, a leopard, a rhinoceros, and an elephant. His work is celebrated in the Library of Congress\u2019 American Folklife Center, and he sculpted a custom horse with a Kansas motif for the state governor\u2019s office.\nIn his heyday, my brother\u2019s story was recounted in articles that appeared in publications ranging from the Los Angeles Times to National Geographic. He wrote a book called Carousel Carving, still in print, which won solid reviews from publications like The Woodworkers Gazette. Then Bruce gave it all up. His reasons were complex; he was frustrated with the business aspects and the lack of appreciation for artists and craftsmen, and he was fighting a long-curbed sense of wanderlust. He found years of happiness driving a tour bus and later worked as a long-haul trucker.\nPeople believe that creativity is a good thing. Perhaps it is, but to be \u201ccreative\u201d also means to be standing outside, looking through a fogged window at the party inside. Being creative means to see things in a different way and sometimes see too much, and to have all those perceptions and connections banging into each other and making small internal explosions. There is too much chaos that must be organized. And something has to come out, or the noise needs to be silenced. If you\u2019re lucky and the stars are aligned, you release the built-up pressure by writing or painting or composing or creating something, anything \u2014 a better mousetrap, a business, or a nonprofit to serve a cause. If you\u2019re not so lucky, you might silence the noise with drink or drugs, or you might end up in a hospital crippled by depression or captive to your fantasies.\nI know this because I am the quiet child, observing, watching the drama around me and trying to make sense of the disorder. I use words to organize and vent the turmoil within me. My brother Bruce used blocks of wood from which he coaxed the animals he claimed were already chained inside. Brent also sculpts wood, but \u2014 like me \u2014 he also uses words and has published many of his poems. My sister Kelly took her heartbreaks as a battered woman and wove them into a strong fabric, an organization that supports other women affected by violence.\nI figured out a long time ago that the artistic sense came from my mother, because she was the one who loved colors and textures and patterns. As my siblings and I started families, this artistic sensibility was very dominant. Amongst all the children and nieces and nephews, it is easier to count off who is not an artist or writer or computer game designer or architect than to say who is. But it\u2019s not just the talent that marks them; they are unconventional, original, restless, and persistent.\nAs my sister said, reading the book Into the Wild was so disturbing she couldn\u2019t finish. The book recounts the story of a bright young man who set off on an odyssey, finally dying alone in the Alaskan wilderness. The story hit too close to home, because her sons might do the same thing.\nMy mother was also the one with the chaotically unstable moods. When my brothers Bruce and Brent were both diagnosed as being bipolar when they were in the Navy, they figured they got it from Mother. I was skeptical; depression was a common companion, but I didn\u2019t think I had seen them manic, and they were never locked up for their mad antics. And then a nephew was hospitalized with psychotic depression. He burned himself with cigarettes to see if he really existed. And a niece was hospitalized for her crazy behavior. Maybe I was wrong, I thought.\nI knew so little about my mother\u2019s family, though. I remembered vague stories about her cousin who was a professor of engineering. He took time off to decide if he wanted to devote his life to the teaching of transcendental meditation instead of engineering, and he instructed my aunt in the art of meditation. She insisted that if everyone would do the same, the world would change. Then I found out about his brother, the one who spent most of his adult life in an institution. Later, yet another of my mother\u2019s cousins committed suicide, and a third was hospitalized for a breakdown.\nAs I tracked down cousins and stories, I learned that my great-grandfather was a violent and erratic man, and my great-grandmother divorced him at a time when divorce was uncommon. She had several young children still at home, and two of her sons \u2014 my great uncles \u2014 ran away from home when she died of breast cancer rather than live with their father or their stepfather. Some of my mother\u2019s uncles drank to excess and left behind shattered marriages and bitter progeny.\nSince no one would talk about them, I always assumed there was something shameful about the Gordons \u2014 and I guess there was. But as I learned more about the family, I learned they came from respectable stock. My great-grandmother\u2019s grandfather, born in England, was an Anglican missionary to the Indians in Canada before settling down in eastern Kansas and ministering to a church. Others were merchants and elected officials. As for the rest, the black dog of depression and the wild siren of mania, we may never know. People don\u2019t talk about those things.\nBooks have been written about the connection between mental illness and creativity, and I thought that might be what was going on in my extended family. The best proof I could see was to survey the paternal side of the family tree. That\u2019s where I saw all the attorneys and accountants. Then my mother was grafted on the tree, and all the twigs bursting from her branch were pointing different directions and, perhaps, touched by fire. They \u2014 we \u2014 seemed to perceive more than other people, a kind of porosity that was devastating. We didn\u2019t fit. We didn\u2019t belong.\nThis deepening understanding of a taint or a blessing upon my family became more vivid when, through genetic testing, I uncovered a distant African-American cousin. She was related to three of us with Gordon blood. At first, I was dazzled simply by the novelty of having an unexpected dark cousin, revealing the sins of my male forebear. Then, I was struck by something else. She was a maker of documentaries, an artist in her own right. Her daughter was a writer.\nPuzzled and surprised, I googled the Gordon surname. I found page after page of artists, from a prominent professor of the fine arts to a maker of tattoos. I discovered a promising young poet, also a professor, killed in an accident just as fame beckoned. And I found two young singer-songwriters, both making a name for themselves. Artists, writers, actors, musicians, and architects \u2014 and scarcely an accountant or attorney among them.\nAs for me, I\u2019m still outside, looking in at the crowd through a fogged window. I have spent my life longing not so much to be inside, but to wrap myself in the mundane. I desire the bungalow with a white picket fence and the mesmerizing allure of being completely ordinary. I have tried very hard, and I think I have come very close to achieving that goal.\nNote: Gordon is not my mother\u2019s real maiden name.

The short answer is that he is Ukrainian, and his great aunts, great uncles and a vast assortment of second and third cousins are still in Europe, not in the United States.\nThe long answer is that many of them didn\u2019t survive the Ukrainian famine of 1932\u20131933.\n\u2018Ideas will come and go, but this is more than an idea. It is peasants kneeling down in the snow asking for bread,\u2019 Muggeridge wrote in his diary. \u2018Something that I have seen and understood.\u2019\nThe state-orchestrated famine, designed by Josef Stalin to break the backs of Ukrainian peasants who refused to join collectives, claimed the lives of at least 4.8 million Ukrainians. That is the conservative estimate; others say the figure was closer to 10 million. No one knows for sure because Stalin suspended routine census taking during the period.\nStalin sealed the borders of the region and then sent soldiers through every home to steal any food that might help the peasants survive. Some resorted to cannibalism. While his own people starved, Stalin exported grain to the West, refusing offers to help from international relief organizations.\nNever heard of the famine? I\u2019m not surprised. Although Stalin\u2019s genocide rivaled or surpassed Hitler\u2019s, the history books I read when I was growing up were mum on the subject. The searing Canadian film Harvest of Despair finally started educating Americans about the planned famine in the early 1980s.\nStalin\u2019s oppression of the story was a triumph of \u201cpublic relations.\u201d He spoonfed the news that he wanted told to eager journalists who didn\u2019t want to lose their cushy jobs in Stalin\u2019s Moscow. After all, foreign correspondents had been \u201cadvised\u201d to remain in Moscow by the press department of the Soviet Commissariat for Foreign Affairs and not go poking around the countryside.\nAnd some of them believed in the idea of a Communist utopia. They couldn\u2019t \u2014 or wouldn\u2019t \u2014 see the truth. One of them, Walter Duranty of the New York Times, won a Pulitzer Prize for his vivid, glowing dispatches about Stalin\u2019s Five Year Plan, in which he attributed the deaths to errors in Stalin\u2019s plan. Duranty was fooled \u2014 or he lied.\nOther journalists tried to tell the story, but their veracity was attacked. In 1932, you see, negotiations were underway to accept the Soviet Union into the League of Nations. Criticizing Stalin\u2019s regime wasn\u2019t \u201cpolitically correct.\u201d Available archival evidence testifies that several Western governments were well-informed about the Ukrainian genocide but adopted a policy of non-interference in the internal affairs of a foreign sovereign state.\nThe British scribe Malcolm Muggeridge, who was sympathetic to Communism when first posted to Moscow, was one of those journalists who told the truth. He described peasants ravaged by hunger, kneeling in the snow and begging for crusts of bread.\n\u201cWhatever I may do or think in the future,\u201d Muggeridge wrote in his diary. \u201cI must never pretend that I haven\u2019t seen this. Ideas will come and go, but this is more than an idea. It is peasants kneeling down in the snow asking for bread. Something that I have seen and understood.\u201d\nAnother was William I. Shirer, author of The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, who recorded the sight of ragged peasants crossing a river to escape the Ukrainian famine. And dispatches from another British journalist, Gareth Jones, left no doubts. \u201cI walked alone through villages,\u201d he wrote. \u201c\u2026everywhere was the cry, \u2018There is no bread.

I wanted to be like Scarlett O\u2019Hara, but not because she was beautiful, flirtatious and rich. For me, a skinny 11-year-old, Scarlett was a symbol of endurance and a worthy role model. She was a courageous, pragmatic fighter who would not, could not, be defeated. I needed her in my life.\nThis isn\u2019t a statement on Gone with the Wind. That\u2019s been done before. This is a statement on amnesia. White amnesia, I call it.\nThis magnificent, sprawling novel resurrected a lost world for me. I remember dashing Rhett, saintly Melanie, and the dreamer Ashley Wilkes (whose appeal to Scarlett always escaped me). Their characters were complex and interesting. By contrast, plump Mammy (Hattie McDaniel) and skinny Prissy (Butterfly McQueen), the two main Black characters, were quickly sketched stereotypes. I never gave that fact a thought.\nWant to read this story later? Save it in Journal.\nThe stereotyping isn\u2019t the point, either. That criticism has been made, too. My point is that I never realized what I didn\u2019t know and didn\u2019t notice. I did not realize the depth of this white amnesia until I read about Elaine, Arkansas. And Tulsa, Oklahoma. And Rosewood, Florida.\n1919 Elaine, Ark. Black farmers met to form a union to fight for better pay and higher cotton prices. A white mob shot at them, and the farmers returned fire in self-defense. A massacre ensued. More than 100 Blacks are confirmed to have been slaughtered, but estimates range up to 800. Sixty-seven individuals were indicted for \u201cinciting violence,\u201d and 12 Black sharecroppers were sentenced to death.\n1921 Tulsa, Okla. A white mob attacked residents and looted and burned homes and businesses in Tulsa\u2019s Greenwood District. At that time, Greenwood was known as the Black Wall Street, the wealthiest Black community in the U.S. Thirty-five square blocks were ravaged, more than 800 people were hospitalized, and some 6,000 Black residents were \u201cinterned,\u201d or detained. A 2001 state commission confirmed 39 dead (26 Black and 13 white), but estimated the true total could have been as high as 300.\n1923 Rosewood, Fla. At least six Blacks and two white people were killed, although eyewitness reports of casualties ranged up to 150. Rosewood, a quiet, primarily Black and self-sufficient village, was completely destroyed. A mob of several hundred whites combed the countryside hunting for Blacks and burned almost every structure in the town. Survivors hid for days in nearby swamps until they were evacuated by train and car to larger towns. No arrests were ever made, and the town was abandoned.\nI wish these were isolated examples, but they aren\u2019t. Chicago. Knoxville. Omaha. Washington, DC. Ocoee and Perry, Fla. Look back to 1887 and Thibodeaux, Louisiana. Some 10,000 sugar-cane workers had the audacity to go on strike for better working conditions. Nobody is really sure how many were killed. Or Atlanta, 1906. According to the Atlanta History Center, some Blacks were hanged from lampposts. Others were shot, beaten, or stabbed to death. They were pulled from street cars and attacked on the street. Homes and businesses were destroyed. It is estimated that up to 15,000 white men and boys roamed the streets, attacking random targets.\nI could go on. In 1912, Willa and Charles Bruce built a California beach resort run for Black residents. White neighbors and the Ku Klux Klan harassed them, and in 1924, city officials condemned the neighborhood and seized the property. The local council said the plot was needed for a park, but the prime real estate stayed vacant for decades.\nThe incident that really gets me occurred in Coffeyville, Kan., in 1927. A white lynch mob stormed the city jail in response to rumors that three \u201cNegroes\u201d had raped two white high school girls. This incident was different, because the mob was driven back, first by Black deputies and then by armed African Americans who saved their neighborhood from burning. The National Guard occupied the city for five days.\nIn the 1920s, Coffeyville was an hour up a dirt road from Tulsa. Residents almost certainly knew the stories. They probably knew the people. They were ready.\nI lived in Coffeyville after I graduated from college, working for the local newspaper. I never knew this history. How could this be?\nThe white men who perpetrated these atrocities claimed different reasons, often having to do with protecting a white woman\u2019s virtue. Tensions were exacerbated by the exodus of Blacks out of the South. Those are different subjects, meriting a whole book. What fascinates me here is the amnesia. White amnesia.\nI learned about the Coffeyville riot from a master\u2019s thesis written by Geoffrey Newman. His work is the only time I have seen mention of this white amnesia. In its collective form, as public memory, certain events are endorsed and memorialized while others are forgotten, he wrote.\n\u201cThis is particularly true of public history, where the erecting of a memorial \u2014 or a museum exhibit \u2014 gives sanction to a particular view of the past,\u201d he said. \u201cCertain events fit the endorser\u2019s accepted frame of reference. Others are consigned to the dustbin of history. Sometimes there is actual suppression of the memory of painful events.\u201d\nHe notes that the subject of slavery certainly was affected by this process, as evidenced by its omission from the public tours of the great plantation houses of the Old South. But In the case of Coffeyville \u2014 where African Americans fought back \u2014 the event simply did not comport with our understanding of the past.\n\u201cSelection becomes the great filter, and the event is omitted,\u201d he said.\nNever once did the harsh reality of slavery penetrate my summer-fogged mind. Scarlett\u2019s family enslaved other human beings. Maybe I can be forgiven; I was an 11-year-old kid in Wichita, Kan., who took pride in tackling such a tome. But the film made from the book \u2014 a technicolor extravaganza released in 1939 \u2014 paid tribute to \u201ca land of Cavaliers and Cotton fields,\u201d a \u201cpretty world where Gallantry took its last bow,\u201d embracing and promoting the Lost Cause mythology. Why? Can we not admit who we are?\nNo one was ever compensated for their loss of land in any of these incidents, and the psychological harm cannot be dismissed. A psychologist at the University of Florida testified in state hearings about the Rosewood massacre that survivors showed signs of post-traumatic stress disorder, made worse by the secrecy. Many years later, they showed fear, denial, and hypervigilance about socializing with whites.\nI notice that people are quick to discount their own connection to slavery. Their family was too poor, or came to this country too late, or didn\u2019t live in the South, they say. \u201cI must admit I don\u2019t dwell on the slave issue,\u201d said an Alabama-born friend of mine. \u201cI didn\u2019t own slaves, and neither did my parents or grandparents and probably only one of my great-grandparents.\u201d\nOne by one, she counted off the reasons why most people in this country want to believe the issue of slavery and its aftermath are no longer relevant. She said she knew enslaving other human beings was wrong and she had sympathy, but after all, that was generations ago. Slavery was legal then and had existed all over the world, she said. \u201cThere are too many real problems today to dwell on what can\u2019t be changed,\u201d she added.\nShe\u2019s wrong. Confession is good for the soul.

My child\u2019s body rarely traveled past the stockyard and feedlot at the edge of town, but my mind was free to explore foreign countries, spend a season with a Bedouin in the desert, or see the world through the eyes of a French madame. My goal was to read every book in that little library.\nI\u2019m not the only child of my generation whose eyes were opened and whose course was set because of trips to a local library built with the help of this diminutive Scottish industrialist (he was only 5-foot-3). Born poor in 1835 in the town of Dunfermline on Scotland\u2019s Firth of Forth, Carnegie became one of the richest men in the world and eventually gave away the bulk of his wealth. A huge chunk went to build municipal libraries in big cities and also in small towns, many of them out on the Midwestern prairies.\nCarnegie\u2019s family immigrated to Pennsylvania in 1848, settling in the town of Allegheny (now part of Pittsburgh). He had attended a free school in Scotland, but when the family immigrated his education ceased. By the age of 13 young Andrew was earning $1.20 a week by working 12-hour days, six days a week, as a bobbin boy in a textile mill. There was no time for schooling, so young Andrew taught himself. He borrowed books from Col. James Anderson, a well-to-do local man who opened his private library, which contained some 400 volumes, to the community\u2019s young working boys every Saturday evening. Carnegie consumed those books when he wasn\u2019t working and resolved that if was ever rich he was going to offer the same opportunity to other poor kids.\nAndrew Carnegie (source: Wikipedia, public domain)\n\u201cTo him I owe a taste for literature which I would not exchange for all the millions that were ever amassed by man,\u201d Carnegie wrote in his autobiography.\nCarnegie went to work for the Pennsylvania Railroad and by his mid-20s was a division superintendent. With tightfisted determination, he invested his earnings in various ventures, including iron and oil companies, making his first fortune by the time he was in his early 30s. He made his second fortune in the steel industry, where he became a major force. Now a steel baron, he sold the Carnegie Steel Co. to banker John Pierpont Morgan for $480 million in 1901. That\u2019s almost $15 billion in today\u2019s dollars.\nFortunately for me, Carnegie had no intention of holding on to his millions. He started endowing libraries as early as the 1880s, with the first in Dunfermline.\n\u201cMan must have no idol and the amassing of wealth is one of the worst species of idolatry!\u201d he wrote at one point. \u201cNo idol is more debasing than the worship of money!\u201d\nIn fact, he argued that a wealthy industrialist should live life in two parts. In the first part he accumulates wealth, and in the second part he gives it away. Philanthropy was key to making life worthwhile, Carnegie maintained. He called this his \u201cgospel of wealth.\u201d\n\u201cThe man who dies rich dies disgraced,\u201d he averred.\nCarnegie got busy giving his money away. He funded retirement pensions for college professors and established the Carnegie Institute of Technology, later Carnegie-Mellon University. He built and owned Carnegie Hall, the famed New York City concert venue. He was a major benefactor of Booker T. Washington and the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama, founded to further the education of African Americans. And he helped Booker T. found the National Negro Business League, too.\nIn all fairness, though, it is important to note that Andrew Carnegie was considered one of America\u2019s \u201crobber barons,\u201d men who became rich by exploiting others. For that reason, his largesse was not without its critics.\n\u201cCarnegie ought to have distributed his money among his employees while he was making it,\u201d declared C.H. Johnson, a Detroit labor official.\nThis story, though, is about libraries, and in 1885 Carnegie started a building program. Communities wanting libraries contacted him, detailing their populations, their reasons for needing a library, and a description of the publicly owned land where a library could be located. Carnegie typically provided some $10,000 to build the library, but the municipality had to provide the books and staff the facility.\nMy home state of Kansas got 58 libraries, including my beloved example in Dodge City. Some are still libraries, although Dodge City\u2019s domed example is now the Carnegie Center for the Arts, with gallery space for local artists and artisans as well as a gift shop.\nAlabama, where I now reside, got 14 municipal libraries, plus five academic libraries. Those academic libraries included one at Alabama Polytechnic Institute, which became Auburn University in the East Alabama town of Auburn. The college got $30,000 for its red brick library, housed in what is now Martin Hall, home for the university\u2019s financial aid offices.\nI live in Auburn, and I am eternally grateful for Carnegie\u2019s funding of that little library. Now, there are several Auburn University libraries boasting millions of volumes, government documents, maps and current periodicals, plus access to a couple of hundred or so electronic databases.\nI have always said that if I suffered a mid-life crisis, I would disappear into the bowels of a library to study ninth century marriage customs or some such esoterica (yes, I am a confirmed introvert). I tend to become enamored of a subject and research it thoroughly, so I am very lucky to have access to a college library here in Auburn. I\u2019m still singing Andrew Carnegie\u2019s praises.\nWhere else can you find the Colonial Records of South Carolina volumes relating to Indian affairs? I have perused the pages of a master\u2019s thesis about the history of the old college infirmary and wrestled with microfilm to read issues of the local newspaper from the early 1900s. You\u2019d be surprised what constituted news in those days.\nI\u2019ve even fended off the advances of a 30-something graduate student. I was carrying a volume about South Carolina\u2019s old Ninety-Six District, and I guess the fellow \u2014 a history student with a passion for the Revolutionary War \u2014 thought he\u2019d found a soul mate.\nAll bibliophiles are the same, if you ask me. Rich or poor, young or old, they\u2019re all seekers, and we all owe Andrew Carnegie a debt of gratitude. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019ve got someplace to go.

And no one became a zen master by doing one ten minute Headspace meditation. We all know that making long-term impactful changes in our lives means that we have to create a habit of whatever our life-changing daily activities are.\nBut for me? In order to maintain those daily habits, I need periodic inspiration to keep myself motivated and on task. This means that to maintain my productivity in any aspect of my life, I need to set up recurring motivation and inspiration. Seems cheesy? Maybe. Does it work? Absolutely.\nIn Positive Psychology, Beata Souders, MSc., PsyD candidate says, \u201cThe study of motivation is a behavioral science that concerns those internal processes that give behavior its energy, direction, and persistence.\u201d So, it\u2019s multifaceted. We not only need to make sure we have the energy to do what we want to do, but we also need to make sure we are going in the right direction and that we persist past any obstacles that may arise.\nSo, here are three ways I care for the energy, direction, and persistence aspects of my motivation to keep my productivity train on track.\nEnergy\nI have written about this before, but it\u2019s imperative to productivity and long-term achievement of my goals (and probably yours as well). I have to care for my body so that my mind stays sharp enough to maintain my focus and tenacity. It seems boring and, well, duh. But there\u2019s a reason that maintaining your physical health is imperative when it comes to productivity. Because it\u2019s true.\nI have found that one of the linchpins of my overall physical health and productivity is\u2026sleep. When I don\u2019t get seven or more hours of sleep, I get grumpy and unfocused. When I get grumpy and unfocused, I grab unhealthy food to make myself feel better. And then that unhealthy food makes me feel physically lethargic and it makes me sleepy (and even more unproductive). It\u2019s a vicious cycle.\nThe simple (and not so simple) solution is most often to make myself go to sleep when I know I should. It\u2019s oh-so-tempting to scroll Instagram, play Candy Crush, or watch that full episode of Real Housewives of Beverly Hills. We often feel like we have unlimited time at the end of the day. But, we don\u2019t. And the more we push that very important bedtime, the more productivity we lose the next day.\nHere are five ways I make myself go to sleep (and get up) at a time that keeps my energy in check so I am motivated to get things done the next day.\nI set a \u201cgo to sleep\u201d alarm. In fact, I set three. I have a 9:45 pm \u201cget ready to go to sleep\u201d alarm, a 9:55 pm \u201cturn off the lights\u201d alarm, and a 10:00 pm \u201cclose your eyes\u201d alarm. One alarm is easy to ignore. Three is much more difficult. I set these as recurring alarms in my phone so I never have to think about it.\nI get some accountability. I have asked my husband to keep me on track when it comes to going to sleep on time. He knows not to ask me to watch a documentary at 9:45 pm and he also gently reminds me to go the heck to sleep when I ignore that third alarm. For those without a bedmate, you can ask a friend to check in and remind you at a specific time to get your rest.\nI set a recurring early morning meeting. Because my parents are in a time zone 3 hours earlier than mine, I meet them every weekday at 5:30 am on Zoom to check in. This forces me to get up and get myself ready to chat by our meeting and it also sets me up to be really ready for bed at 10 pm.\nDirection\nI am very easily distracted when it comes to my motivation. Oh, look! Something new and shiny to conquer! A new challenging marathon? Count me in! A yoga certification? Why not! How about a new degree? Yeppers!\nBut, often getting involved in things that don\u2019t take you to what you want your final destination to be is, well, counterproductive. Extra projects take time and they take you off the path to ward achieving the thing you want most. It\u2019s no wonder that direction is one of the three components of motivation.\nBecause my mind can justify practically anything, I have set up an accountability goal group that meets once per quarter to keep each other on track. We take turns hosting each other at our houses, bring a potluck of snacks, and report on our progress toward our goals. We make observations about each others\u2019 trajectories and we offer advice on how to optimize our paths.\nSometimes when you\u2019re on a journey, you can\u2019t always see from a bird\u2019s eye view. My goal group allows me to get a drone shot of the terrain around me and find the best path to get to where I\u2019m going. If you don\u2019t have a group of folks willing to boost your motivation and help you find direction, Meetup.com is a great place to start.\nPersistence\nAs I mentioned at the beginning of this article, you don\u2019t get fit from going to the gym only a few times. And you won\u2019t maintain your motivation if you don\u2019t have resources to keep you persistent in your quests for awesomeness. I love to set up regularly-occurring sources of motivation to help me stay on my path and not get too complacent.\nMotivation is an ongoing practice and if you don\u2019t have ways to keep you persistent, you\u2019re likely to fall into your old habits. Here are some great sources for ongoing motivation in keeping on the path to productivity:\nThe One Daily Nugget newsletter. This newsletter searches through the most inspirational and insightful articles on self-improvement and shares them every day to help people boost their productivity and personal growth. (You can check out an article from yours truly recently on there as well). Different people say things in different ways, so hearing diverse voices every day can sometimes set off a motivational lightbulb in your head.\nThe School of Greatness podcast. I love listening to podcasts as I run and this one is one of the most inspirational I have found. I have learned about neuroscience, nutrition, life hacks, relationships, and money mindsets. I always feel like I can persevere after listening to one of these long-form interviews with knowledgable and successful guests.\nMy local library. Yes, It sounds odd. But once I started my motivational reading habit, I have continued it. And I love it. I simply go to my local library to return the book I have, pick up a new motivational book, and I read a little bit of it every night before I go to sleep. This helps me persevere because I\u2019m getting a little bit of information or motivation every night to keep me going in the morning. (Right now, I\u2019m reading Dorie Clark\u2019s The Long Game.)\nFinal thoughts\nWe all need a little help to get to where we want to go. Motivation is no different. The best way to set yourself up for success is to tend to your energy, your direction, and your persistence.

And you can change it.\nImage by Foxpool from Pixabay\nI, like the enduring geek that I am, have been tracking my bouts of imposter syndrome. As the co-founder of a startup, I often feel that I have no business doing what I\u2019m doing. I look around and think, \u201cWhat am I doing? Why in the world should anyone listen to me?\u201d\nYes, friends. That is my imposter syndrome rearing its ugly head and wreaking havoc on the bottom line of my fledgling business.\nSo, how does one fix imposter syndrome? Great question. I have some ideas.\nThe first scientists to define what was then called \u201cimposter phenomenon,\u201d Suzanne Imes, PhD, and Pauline Rose Clance, PhD, described it as occurring \u201camong high achievers who are unable to internalize and accept their success. They often attribute their accomplishments to luck rather than to ability, and fear that others will eventually unmask them as a fraud.\u201d\nSo, high achievers do what they do \u2014 achieve. And then, they don\u2019t believe that they are deserving of the fruits of their labors.\nI felt the same thing when I was on a plane to be the keynote speaker at a national convention in the middle of America. Somehow, I had worked hard to create a company that adds so much value as to warrant my travel to speak in front of hundreds of people. Yet, I felt that somehow, I was a fraud.\nSo, like I said, I decided to log my instances of imposter syndrome and cross reference them with other key metrics in my life. I found some surprising correlations.\nMy imposter syndrome happens when\u2026\nDo you know when my feelings of being a fraud were most acute? When I was, as I would call it, \u201coff my game.\u201d I am usually pretty good at working out, eating healthily, getting enough good sleep, and steering clear of unhealthy habits. But, when I did fall off the wagon (either by ordering delivery McDonald\u2019s for two consecutive evenings or by choosing to stay up until 1 am watching reality television when I know I have a presentation the next morning), my imposter syndrome reared its ugly head soon thereafter.\nIt makes sense to me, though. When I can\u2019t keep a simple promise to myself to go to bed at a reasonable time or step away from that second glass of wine, who is to say that I am worthy of running a company? Or that I\u2019m responsible enough to speak in front of hundreds of people?\nThere\u2019s a great article in the Harvard Business Review by Teresa M. Amabile and Steven J. Kramer that discusses the power of small wins. In it, they say, \u201cBig wins are great \u2014 but they are relatively rare. The good news is that even small wins can boost inner work life tremendously. Many of the progress events our research participants reported represented only minor steps forward. Yet they often evoked outsize positive reactions.\u201d\nConfidence is built, not innate. And when we have small wins in our lives (taking good care of our health, remembering to RSVP to a kid birthday party in a timely manner, etc.), they build our confidence in ourselves and our ability to tackle challenges, ever how small.\nAnd when we build our confidence in our own ability to tackle challenges, we are more likely to become more and more comfortable with our ability to do difficult things, inspire respect, lead others, and step boldly into whatever endeavor we aspire to create.\nWhen we can\u2019t even achieve mastery over ourselves, it\u2019s no wonder we doubt our ability to lead outside the purview of our own autonomy.\nKicking imposter syndrome to the curb\nFirst, I must say that, in my research for this article, most of the articles I read on imposter syndrome are geared toward women. Even this article in the New York Times is in the \u201cWorking Woman\u2019s Handbook\u201d section.\nOn this note, I say: Do better, people.\nAll humans are susceptible to imposter syndrome. End of story. Want to read more about why we shouldn\u2019t just tell women that they experience this? Here\u2019s a great article. The long and the short of it is that bias creates feelings of doubt (rightfully so). So, let\u2019s stop telling female-identifying humans they feel like imposters and start treating them as equals.\n[Michelle steps off soapbox.]\nNow, how does anyone and everyone start to kick imposter syndrome to the curb? Well, similar to the gender bias, I say the same thing: Do better, people.\nI\u2019m not implying that we all need to do a better job at our jobs. I\u2019m saying that the better I care for my physical needs, the more likely I am to approach a situation with confidence. When I haven\u2019t gotten enough sleep, I tend to hone in on the negative aspects of every interaction. When I haven\u2019t eaten healthy foods, I tend to have less ambition when it comes to stepping bravely into new spaces. And yes, when I don\u2019t move my body on a regular basis, I lose confidence. And my imposter syndrome creeps in.\nSo, how do we beat this secret (curable) cause of imposter syndrome? Well, it\u2019s simple. And difficult. But, the idea is simple. We set up a series of standards for ourselves and we work hard to meet them. With each personal goal we meet, we build our self-esteem and we take away that nagging voice in our minds.\nWhen you succeed in your personal goals, instead of \u201cyou can\u2019t even do the intermittent fasting you said you would do,\u201d your internal dialogue turns to, \u201cI accomplished what I set out to do.\u201d And with each personal goal you achieve, no matter what it is, you put one more brick onto the wall between you and the feeling that you are a fraud.\nFinal thoughts\nWe all feel like a fraud sometimes. But, we don\u2019t have to always feel like one. There is a secret (curable) cause of imposter syndrome and I believe that it is self-mastery. When you can keep your promises to yourself, when you learn to trust yourself to live up to your word, you can begin to build the self-esteem that encourages you to believe others should trust you as well.\nIt takes time, but confidence is built, not innate. And we all can build confidence, one small victory at a time.\nGet my free 36-page eBook on how to optimize your productivity.\nIf you liked this story, you\u2019ll probably like this one:\nOne Piece of Productivity Advice For Everyone\nIf you could only do one thing to get more done\u2026betterhumans.pub\nJoin Medium with my referral link - Michelle Loucadoux, MBA\nAs a Medium member, a portion of your membership fee goes to writers you read, and you get full access to every story\u2026michelleloucadoux.medium.com", "comment_count": 5, "like_count": 490, "created_time": 1650569686222, "comment": [{"user_id": "4dc2cfbb008b", "comment_time": 1650569686222, "comment": "Thank you for sharing!"}, {"user_id": "faa62ef2cef2", "comment_time": 1650894627683, "comment": "This is a whole new thought for me but it feels spot on! \ud83d\udca1 Finally, a simple explanation that makes sense and feels like something I can work on rather than trying to run from a mysterious Boogeyman lurking behind me all the time.

Awash with green and revelries, March 17 is also a day to reflect on the Irish immigrant experience.\nWhat better way to do so than with three terrific films to watch, with each heartwarmingly and artfully touching on the Irish immigrant story. While specific in theme, they each, however, explore aspects that everyone can relate to.\nBrooklyn (2015)\n1 | Brooklyn (2015)\nIn 1950s New York City, an Irish immigrant, played by the talented Saoirse Ronan, must choose between a new life in Brooklyn and that of the one she leaves behind. Caught between a rock and a hard place, she must contend with everything that comes with a new life, from a new job to a first love.\nBrooklyn received widespread critical acclaim when it first premiered at the 2015 Sundance Film Festival. Further nominated for three Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Actress, and Best Adapted Screenplay, Brooklyn is a film that will move you to tears and remind you of the value of family \u2014 and the pressures of having to make life-changing decisions.\nFar and Away (1992)\n2 | Far and Away (1992)\nAcross epic panoramas and captivating soundtracks, powerhouse actor Tom Cruise and iconic actress Nicole Kidman costar \u2014 as a then real-life couple \u2014 in the 1992 melodrama Far and Away. After the passing of his farmer father, Joseph (Cruise) leaves Ireland with his landlord\u2019s daughter (Kidman) for America, with aspirations of acquiring property during the Oklahoma Land Rush of 1889.\nBut they must navigate monumental barriers of class, self-image, and love \u2014 everything that is at stake with their story of immigration. As they make their way via Boston, Joseph takes up boxing to provide financial support. Yet after losing a significant sum following the loss of a crucial fight, both are hit with hardship. They must then find new ways to get by as a life-long pair. As their love intensifies in this period piece, Joseph begins to wonder if he is actually what Shannon needs in her life.\nIn America (2002)\n3 | In America (2002)\nThis semi-autobiographical and critically-acclaimed film is the work of Irish director Jim Sheridan. Sharing a similar story with that of Brooklyn, in this immensely moving story, the family relocates from Ireland to a tenement in New York City, such that the father can pursue his ambition of becoming an actor. This all takes place with the backdrop of grieving the death of one of his children, to which the Irish family must learn to adjust to a whole new life on the rough streets of Hell\u2019s Kitchen.\nTearjerkers: They\u2019re not the obvious choice after cheery, comedic celebrations but they\u2019re wonderfully cathartic.

This time, it\u2019s even backed by a renewed corporate social responsibility that\u2019s worth salivating over.\nWhether for the first or the fiftieth time in your life, you can now enjoy a tub alongside or after your Guinness. And it\u2019s sure to be a new favourite or nostalgic hit, respectively, from the Iconic Vermont-based ice cream parlour chain.\nAfter a short, yet successful, stint of three years in production, the Dublin Mudslide is ready to score a landslide victory, once again, on the winning platform of delicious Irish cream liqueur, chocolate chip cookies, and coffee fudge swirls.\n\nYet this time, the company is kicking it up a notch with the iconic flavour now spiked with Wheyward Spirit \u2014 a new and exciting spirit made from whey.\nAs a nutrient-dense byproduct of cheese and yogurt production, Wheyward Spirit is rather putting it to good use, helping to redirect some of the estimated 130 billion pounds worth of annual food waste associated with whey, according to a Ben & Jerry\u2019s press release.\nWheyward Spirit further celebrates the fact that leveraging an otherwise simple waste product for the creation of a spirit is, indeed, in good spirit to \u201cserve the greater good and guarantee a good time.\u201d Needless to say, that\u2019s the spirit!\nIn true spirit, the childhood duo behind the sweet brand is resurrecting the flavour from their unique and whimsical Flavor Graveyard \u2014 but with this renaissance also comes a sweet bonus of sustainably sourced whey from domestic dairies.\nNon-GMO, fair-trade, and cage-free: Ben & Jerry\u2019s, moreover, sources its ingredients responsibly, which definitely makes each Dublin Mudslide scoop that much sweeter.\nWith the extra boozy splash, you\u2019ll also get the \u201csignature flavour of oaky hints of vanilla cream and warm spice notes, rounded with a subtle pear aroma,\u201d according to Wheyward Spirit, making it the perfect addition to an already delectable ice cream.\nIn a timely celebration of Women\u2019s History Month, it\u2019s worth also shining the spotlight on Wheyward Spirit CEO and food scientist Emily Darchuk, highlighting her \u201cpart of a new generation of women revolutionizing the male-dominated wine and spirits industry,\u201d as reported by Ben & Jerry\u2019s.\nThis collaboration not only yields a more sustainable version of an old favourite but also a terrific treat for those who love their sweets with an environmental conscience \u2014 so be sure to check your store\u2019s freezers this St. Patrick\u2019s Day.\nRelated: Notes on Nutrition: Two Simple Yet Inspiring Ways to Manage Your Sweet Tooth", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 50, "created_time": 1647479967789, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Food", "Life", "Culture", "Lifestyle", "Business"]}, {"author": "Jarvis Wai-Ki Clarke", "post_id": "c9ba99eaf1ef", "user_id": "6b5e9ab8e220", "title": "Produce Profiles: What Does March Have in Store for Vegetables?", "content": "A basket of green aptly describes the best of what March has to offer | Photo by Alesia Kozik on Pexels\nProduce Profiles: What Does March Have in Store for Vegetables?\nThe seasonal selection is like a mix of sunshine, showers, and clouds \u2014 there are hits and misses\nWe\u2019re all on the clock. And thanks to Daylight Savings Time, its hands have just sprung us forward by an hour. Even though said savings haven\u2019t saved us from feeling a tad grumpier and groggier, Mother Nature isn\u2019t hitting the snooze button for what\u2019s in season this month.\nWhile we begin to fantasize about the return of brighter and warmer days as March bridges us from winter to spring, we\u2019ll have to patiently wait for a tad longer to enjoy the best of spring, let alone summer, vegetables. Nevertheless, March still has tasty and healthy options, replete with antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals\u2014chock-full of luscious green colour, too.\nSwiss Chard\nThe month of March marks the very beginning of the chard season, which extends from the end of March to October. This means that you have just over half of the year to enjoy its full glory in wonderful dishes like a warm chard salad with chicken or a colourful risotto with mushrooms.\nClosely related to the beet, the leafy green vegetable is also known for its impressive calcium content and low calorie count, which will cost you a nominal 35 calories per cup. This ancient vegetable is, moreover, rich in fibre, which helps you from snacking away at carb-laden foods. That said, if you do eat a lot of it in one go, your teeth may feel slightly funny with a gritty texture \u2014 due to the presence of oxalic acid.\nRelated: Pasta, Pizza, and Fries: Satisfy These Popular Carb Cravings With Tasty and Healthy Alternatives\nCelery\nWhile celery isn\u2019t particularly popular in my books as a star ingredient, it yet plays an important role in building an overall flavourful dish. And I especially rely on it for soups, stews, and risottos. Importantly, it even has international prestige: From the French mirepoix to the Cajun Holy Trinity, and to the Italian soffrito, celery forms the foundations to many exquisite dishes of these cuisines.\nTo that end, it\u2019s likewise a vegetable that is commonly found at market stalls from March to October. Of course, it\u2019s always to be found at the grocery store. At only 14 calories per cup, celery also offers a great source of fibre, making it one of North America\u2019s most iconic and appreciated kid\u2019s snacks: Ants on a Log.\nCabbage\nWhile positively not a favourite of most kids, cabbage yet enjoys a season that extends from September to April. This, ironically, makes it the perfect ingredient for many packed school meals. But there are wonderful ways to cook with the humble vegetable, whether rolled or stir-fried.\nOn the nutrition front, white cabbage, red cabbage, kohlrabi, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, and so on all have interesting benefits for your body, including coming in at a low-calorie amount of just 22 calories per cup. Rich in vitamins and minerals, each cabbage variant improves your overall digestive health, largely thanks to the helpful push from gut-friendly insoluble fibre \u2014 a key to regular bowel movements.\nLeeks\nWhile onions command a wider audience in most kitchens, year-round, leeks yet demand that you enjoy their full flavour before the arrival of summer weather. And so, you can cook with this cousin of garlic and onion at its peak, from September to April.\nAlthough it can cause a bit of friction when it comes to cleaning \u2014 literally \u2014 it is well worth the extra elbow grease. Because it lends a beautifully delicate and savoury essence to just about anything \u2014 pies, soups, and so much more.\nThis rather long vegetable, which contains slightly more carbohydrates compared to others, also comes with a slightly higher calorie amount of 54 calories per cup. Regardless, its other amazing health benefits far outweigh this \u2014 offering calcium, potassium, iron, Vitamin C, Vitamin B6 and Vitamin A, antioxidants, and fibre.\nAsparagus\nThe asparagus season is relatively short, only running a stint from late February to May, so take advantage of it while it\u2019s around \u2014 and at its peak flavour and nutrition. Although this spearlike vegetable is accessible throughout the year, spring is the best time to enjoy it in a wide array of preparations.\nWhen freshly harvested, asparagus is also softer and livelier than the imported variety, boasting an excellent source of fibre, beta carotene, and vitamin C. Besides taking advantage of what it has to offer for nutrition, it is even more important to do so as asparagus is, quite surprisingly and critically, a rather significant culprit of carbon emissions. And so, this just underscores how important it is to buy the slender vegetable when it\u2019s in season.\nFun fact: White asparagus is a fascinating variation of its more popular green counterpart, and it is developed by depriving the plant of sunlight during the developing phase. Albeit less common to be found, purple asparagus is awesome \u2014 so don\u2019t hesitate to take them home wherever you can.\nSpring gives you that extra spring in your step for more exciting vegetables to come but these are four great options to cook with for a rather green month \u2014 and they\u2019re perfect for St. Patrick\u2019s Day celebrations.\nRelated: Stretch Your Veg: Best Practices for Storing Your Produce", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 105, "created_time": 1647388772001, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Food", "Cooking", "Home", "Culture", "Life"]}, {"author": "Dr. Cort Dorn-Medeiros", "post_id": "6360e98ea309", "user_id": "4362127ec596", "title": "A Parent\u2019s Guide to Digital Wellness", "content": "A Parent\u2019s Guide to Digital Wellness\nDeveloping a family culture to combat digital overload\nPhoto by John Schnobrich on Unsplash\nOur daily lives are a constant barrage of beeps, boops, buzzes, and dings. Our iPhone cries for attention, our laptop chirps a new email alert, and we shout at Alexa demanding to know today\u2019s weather. We shove boots onto unwilling, tablet-holding toddlers and make multiple attempts to gain our screen-glued teenager\u2019s attention. Mornings like these are the perfect storm for an existential crisis. What are we even doing?\nTechnological advances have undoubtedly made our lives easier in many ways. Long car rides might be a bit more relaxing with our middle schooler engaged in a video game or our 5-year-old watching Moana for the hundredth time. Video conferencing software allowed many across the country to attend school or work and have some sort of socialization during one of the many peaks of COVID-19.\nFamily schedules are coordinated and streamlined with only a few clicks. Smartphones give us a sense of security, knowing our children can contact us in an emergency. It isn\u2019t all bad.\nAnd then come the mornings of struggle over toddler tablets. Or the fights over dinner when our tween can\u2019t pull away from TikTok. Or concern over our teenager staying up all night playing video games only to be falling asleep in class the next day. Our spouse or partner merely grunts when we attempt to make conversation over morning coffee.\nWith a plethora of devices constantly vying for our attention, family relations can feel tenuous, at best. But outside of the occasional annoyance or argument with a tech-riddled teen or spouse, what is the big deal with chronic tech use? Does it have a real-world impact on our family\u2019s health and wellbeing?\nDangers in the Digital World\nAs parents, we direct most of our digital concerns towards our children. However, it is first essential to note the impact of technology on ourselves. When it comes to social media, we are not immune to the phenomenon of social comparison. You know\u2026that one friend who seems to have it all? The perfect marriage, the perfect baby, the perfect job, the perfect body, the Hawaiian vacations, and seemingly endless amounts of money.\nOur rational brain knows it\u2019s a highly curated representation of our friend\u2019s life. The other part of our brain writhes in envy and wonders how we, too, can have perfect things and piles of money. Maybe we even feel a little down about ourselves or our own life and accomplishments. Why aren\u2019t we more successful? Why aren\u2019t we more beautiful? Why won\u2019t our kids stand like perfect angels for family photos? Why doesn\u2019t our body look like that?\nIf we take a moment to reflect on our own experiences with social media, we can begin to imagine how our children have similar experiences, only tenfold. Teens and tweens spend an average of six to nine hours per day online. Social media exposes our children to a never-ending onslaught of \u201cperfect\u201d peers and a representation of all of the things they do not have.\nWhile parents may be concerned about screen addiction, it is rare in children and teenagers. However, dangers in the digital world do exist. These can include cyberbullying, increased anxiety-related to response-time on social media and texting apps, upward comparisons such as in the above example, and even encouragement for eating disorders through thinspo or fitspo accounts.\nAdd to all of this the increased screen time demanded of us all during the COVID-19 pandemic. We are all feeling more stressed, tired, cranky, burned out, and irritable. Yes, Zoom fatigue is real.\nOne way we can mitigate the strife and stress that comes with screens is to develop a culture of digital wellness within our families.\nDigital Wellness\nWe often associate aspects of our life such as nutrition, movement, mitigating stress levels, and staying hydrated with health and wellness. Less frequently, we think about how our chronic use of technology may be impacting our overall wellness and that of our family.\nThe Digital Wellness Lab at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital defines digital wellness as \u201cAn intentional state of physical, mental, and social health that occurs with mindful engagement with the digital and natural environment.\u201d\nThat sounds great, but what does it mean?\nDigital wellness, in practice, means we strive to have a balanced approach to daily living to ensure we spend time off the screen. Digital health means we intentionally approach all aspects of digital technology, including social media, gaming, and even email, with a sense of responsibility and mindfulness. We practice intentional engagement with the natural environment, meaning we go outside and see the light of day now and then.\nMaintaining digital wellness can sound like a lofty goal for full-grown adults and parents. The digital world encompasses most of our personal and professional lives. We can easily become overwhelmed with the need to also mitigate our children\u2019s technology use.\nHow can we structure our and our children\u2019s lives to create a better environment centered on digital wellness?\nDigital Wellness as a Family Affair\nNo matter how important our job might be or how reliant we are on a prompt response to emails or text messages, we are constantly modeling technology use for our children. We may think our work-texting over dinner is justified because we need to wrap up this one last thing. Or the work call we take while watching a movie with our family is no big deal because that\u2019s how we pay the bills.\nWe all have difficult decisions, and personal and professional priorities are complex. There is no shame and blame here. But, as parents, we have to be honest that we are consistently modeling for our children. And technology use is no different.\nObjectively speaking, our work is likely more important than our teenager\u2019s TikTok viewing. But to our children, there is no difference. Their online attention to peer interactions is just as important as our attention to our work phone.\nDigital wellness needs to be a family affair.\nApproaches to Digital Wellness\nAll families are different. What works for one family may not work for another. There is no one template for digital wellness that will work for everyone. Before developing a family wellness plan, take time to think and reflect on your family\u2019s needs and priorities.\nIs it essential that your family eat one meal a day together? Do you value extended family time outside? Intentional connectedness through playing a board game? Simply sharing space and watching a movie together on the weekends? Verbal connectedness by scheduling a family meeting once per week?\nAgain, there is no one-size-fits-all.\nThe following strategies are helpful to create a culture of digital wellness within your family.\nCommunication\nThe first approach to digital wellness is communication. As parents, we must communicate with our children that digital health and wellness are essential to us and explain why. There should be no finger-wagging, and be careful to use \u201cwe\u201d language. A few important points to note:\nWe include ourselves and our technology use in the conversation. If you have very young children, have this conversation with a spouse or partner. If you\u2019re a single parent, ask a friend or family member to discuss digital wellness or how they approach technology use within their families.\nInclude older children in family discussions about digital wellness. Communicate that you are inviting ongoing conversation about technology use and feedback about your technology use as well.\nYour children should see you as a safe person to discuss their concerns or worries about technology, including social media interactions. They should also communicate their concerns about your technology use if and when it becomes problematic.\nConnection\nAll digital wellness plans should include some aspects of intentional family connection. Connection does not need to look one specific way, but it can help to overlap with family tech breaks. A few examples can be:\nCreate a \u201cfamily phone box\u201d and have everyone put their phones in the box for an hour at dinner every day. Or schedule a game afternoon once per week where everyone must relinquish their phones to the box for the game\u2019s duration. Yes, everyone. Even you, parents!\nGet out of the house and connect with nature. Digital wellness includes engagement with the natural environment. Engagement with nature can include things like hiking or planning a camping trip. But it can also be simple,, like planning family walks a couple of times per week, going to a park for a couple of hours, doing some gardening, or even eating a meal outside.\nPlan a \u201cyes\u201d day with your family under one caveat: Phones, tablets, and other tech gadgets stay put away for the day. And, yes, that includes yours as well.\nContinuity\nYour needs and priorities and those of your family will change over time. Digital wellness plans should be living, breathing methods that change with time. They live in a state of continuity. What is appropriate for your 5-year-old will likely not be suitable for your 15-year-old. Or even your 10-year-old.\nLikewise, we change jobs over time, and our professional digital requirements will wax and wane. Digital wellness should be an ongoing discussion within families rather than a one-and-done, fix-it mentality.\nBuilding a Family Culture of Digital Wellness\nWhen first broaching digital wellness, your family might meet you with some resistance. Even your partner or spouse may balk at examining their own technology use. Resistance is normal.\nWe are so reliant on technology in our daily lives the thought of removing some aspect of our digital engagement can be anxiety-provoking. For adolescents and teenagers, especially, even an hour away from their online peer connections can seem impossible.\nPractice empathy and do your best to be patient. Understand that digital wellness is a cultural shift for many people and families. Creating a new cultural norm within families takes time.\nStart small and recognize that even broaching this topic with your family is a step in the right direction.\nI hope this article has been helpful!

So you never applied. Or the 5K you thought about running but feared embarrassment if you needed to walk. So you never signed up. Perhaps there\u2019s that person you\u2019ve wanted to spend more time with but feared rejection. So you never asked. Maybe you\u2019re saddled with the heavy burden of needing to tell something important to a family member, but it never seems to be the right time. So you\u2019ve avoided the conversation for days, months, years, or even decades.\nI\u2019m sure you can fill in your own blank here. As I said, we\u2019ve all been there.\nSome might think of these situations as cases of analysis paralysis. Analysis paralysis, sometimes also known as decision fatigue, often comes when we have many viable options. Analysis paralysis results in feelings of overwhelm. We feel stuck, uncertain about which of many possible roads to go down.\nThe scenarios presented here are different. We don\u2019t feel overwhelmed by our choices. We aren\u2019t wringing our hands over what restaurant will impress that person. Or what we should talk about during the job interview.\nWe fear the possible outcome of what might happen if we decide to follow through with our desired behavior.\nWe perceive risk involved in our desired behavior and will not act without guarantee of a positive outcome.\nWhy we attach to outcomes\nOur brains love certainty. If we do A, then B will happen. If we do not have certainty, as we often do not, our brains will happily fill in the blanks.\nAnxiety is feelings of nervousness or worries about an imminent event or something with an uncertain outcome. Note that within the context of this article when I refer to anxiety, I am not speaking to Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), Panic Disorder (PD) or other clinically severe forms of anxiety. If you struggle with GAD, PD, or other forms of severe anxiety, please seek the help of a qualified mental health professional.\nFor those of us who lean a bit more to the anxious side, however, these blanks (unknown outcomes) usually get filled in with anything from a mildly undesirable consequence to our worst possible fears coming true.\nThanks a lot, brain. What a jerk.\nWe attach to specific outcomes as a way to manage our anxiety. In the short term, we feel better and less anxious. \u201cI will only do A if I know that B will happen.\u201d\nThe problem is that outcomes are generally out of our control. We can gain confidence in a specific outcome. If I train for a 5K, I will likely feel more confident about my ability to complete it. Objectively, my chances of a successful outcome may be increased.\nBut who knows? I could trip over my shoelaces in the first mile, roll my ankle, and not be able to finish. We feel like we are in complete control over the outcome here, but we are not.\nNo risk, no reward\n\u201cIf you dare nothing, then when the day is over, nothing is all you will have gained.\u201d\n\u2015 Neil Gaiman, The Graveyard Book\nRisk is not only reserved for jumping out of airplanes. Or for Steve-O from Jackass getting raw meat torn out of his underwear by alligators.\nRisk simply means a situation that exposes us to potential harm, danger, or loss. Air travel is risky. Driving a car is risky. Being in a relationship with others is risky. Some might say that just living life is risky.\nRisk is everywhere. We make conscious and unconscious decisions about what types of risk we will tolerate every single day.\nModerate risk-taking can have several benefits. These benefits can include:\nUnexpected personal or professional opportunities.\nDesensitization to fear of failure.\nBuilding confidence, especially around new situations.\nLearning new things and gaining new skills.\nMeeting new people and developing new relationships.\nPersonal and professional growth and development.\nI often tell my students that any type of growth is typically both challenging and involves some level of risk. Let\u2019s use the old example of planting a seed. We could put that seed in the ground and push it way down. It will be safe and protected from rain, wind, and the occasional raccoon. Some risk, perhaps, but very little if I bury it really deep.\nSafe? Likely. But will it grow? Likely not.\nLetting go of outcomes\nIf we know our anxious brain\u2019s desire for certainty is getting in the way (jerk), how do we go about losing our attachment to outcomes?\nIt is not easy. But it is simple.\nFocus on the process of the behavior itself, not on the desired outcome.\nThat sounds great, but what does it mean? Let\u2019s use our examples from the very first paragraph.\nIf we focus on the process, we will show up to our 5K and start running. We may or may not finish as that is out of our control. And that is okay. Showing up and getting started was our goal.\nIf we focus on the process, we apply for that dream job. We may or may not get the job as that is out of our control. And that is okay. Simply applying for the job was our goal.\nIf we focus on the process, we ask that person if they will have dinner with us. They may or may not say yes as that is out of our control. And that is okay. Just taking the step and asking was our goal.\nYou get the idea.\n\u201cAnd that is okay\u201d means we will be able to cope with results out of our control. We trust we will be able to move on. We will have feelings. We should have feelings! We may be disappointed or frustrated or sad if we walk in our 5K, don\u2019t get that dream job, or the person turns us down. We are not robots.\nBut telling our anxious brain to stick it involves respecting and acknowledging our success in following through with the process of our desired behavior.\nI am successful if I follow through with A, as B is not under my control.\nA final word on risk-taking\nIn his now internet-famous 2005 commencement speech at Kenyon College, David Foster Wallace included the following parable:\nThere are these two young fish swimming along, and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says, \u201cMorning, boys. How\u2019s the water?\u201d And the two young fish swim on for a bit, and then eventually, one of them looks over at the other and goes, \u201cWhat the hell is water?\u201d\nWallace uses this story to argue against falling into an unconscious way of living. It is a cautionary tale of how easy it is to unconsciously conform to the rat race. It\u2019s about building awareness that parts of \u201creal life\u201d will be hidden away and go unseen without reminding ourselves, \u201cThis is water.\u201d\nRisk is everywhere. It\u2019s a part of that water we swim through every day. And I would say most of you have done as good a job as any in negotiating the everyday risks that come with your daily routines.\nLet go of that of which you have no control. Recognize that few things in life have certain outcomes. Recognize measured risk-taking as a part of personal and professional growth and development. Don\u2019t be the seed stuck so far down in the dirt that it can\u2019t strive for the light of day.\nStretch yourself to do that thing that feels risky. That makes you feel nervous. That has your anxiously uncertain brain telling you all sorts of horrors. Commit to the process and let the rest go.\nAnd I promise. No jumping out of airplanes or feeding raw chicken to alligators out of your underpants is required.\nI hope this article has been helpful! If so, consider becoming a Medium member for only $5/month.

Perhaps this will help.\nIn his 1657 Lettres Provinciales, French mathematician and philosopher Blaise Pascal wrote, \u201cI have made this [letter] longer than usual because I have not had the time to make it shorter.\u201d\nOften cited throughout several seasons of Project Runway, Coco Chanel once stated, \u201cBefore you leave the house, look in the mirror and take one thing off.\u201d\nIn a recent interview on the Bare Performance Podcast, Super Coffee CEO and one of three founding brothers, Jim DeCicco, shared the initial challenges of marketing his supped-up coffee. DeCicco initially plastered Super Coffee\u2019s website with peer-reviewed scientific research about the benefits of MCT oil and healthy fats.\nHowever, early customers did not care about the health benefits of Super Coffee. They were overwhelmed by the website\u2019s excessive amount of scientific jargon. What they did care about was that Super Coffee tasted like a Starbucks Frappuccino at a fraction of the cost.\nAfter taking a step back, DeCicco removed the scientific research from the website, simplified the product\u2019s marketing strategy, and watched sales grow.\nAnswer\nBrevity is difficult, editing matters, and less is more.\nThe Challenge of Brevity\nCenturies after Pascal penned his famous quote, why is it still so dang hard to get to the point?\nWhether writing or speaking, take comfort that overexplaining and verbosity are normal. You are not alone.\nCommon reasons why we struggle with conciseness:\nAnxiety\nLacking clarity\nMisalignment of goals\nDisingenuousness\nComfort\nOverconfidence\nThere are also more recent discussions about overexplaining being a trauma response. While a deep dive into psychological trauma is outside the scope of the present article, I recommend you read up on this connection and reach out to a mental health professional if you think this applies to you.\n5 Tips To Say More With Less\nWhether you are a business owner looking to increase your customer base, a professional tasked with public speaking, or an entrepreneur pitching to investors, brevity is key to effective communication.\nThe following are five tips to say more with less.\n1. Find Your Mission and Stick To It\nA common misstep in communication is a lack of purpose. What are we here to do? When we do not know our goal, we over-communicate and overexplain.\nWhen speech writing, take a moment to think about why you are giving this speech. What do you want your audience to take away from your talk? List out a few key points you want to communicate and build your talk around those points.\nIf you are a business owner, what is the mission of your business? If you do not have a mission statement, work with your team to create one. Even if you are a business of one, take time to consider and clarify a mission statement.\nReview all marketing materials, including your website. Ensure your mission statement is clear and stated in simple terms easily understood by a broad audience.\n2. Stay Humble\nOkay, so you are an expert in your field. That is wonderful! You have so much to offer your colleagues, customers, and other professionals.\nHowever, your brilliance will be lost on annoyed audience members or colleagues when they grow bored of rambling speeches, struggle to get a word in during a meeting, or who develop carpal tunnel scrolling through your lengthy emails.\nConfidence is a strength. Overconfidence is a weakness.\nStay focused and stick to a few key points in your communication. Everyone knows you are brilliant; you don\u2019t need to keep proving it.\nTake Coco Chanel\u2019s advice and remove one (or twenty) items from that speech, email, or article before sending it out into the world.\n3. Make Anxiety your Friend\nWhat if our problem is not humility but anxiety? Anxiety is a common experience and leads to a lack of confidence in our communication. Anxiety is why glossophobia, or fear of public speaking, is one of the biggest fears of people all across the globe.\nIf we are anxious about writing a response to our boss, we are likely to muddle our position rather than state it in clear, concise terms. In front of a crowd, we may talk around our point but never get to it.\nAnxiety loves to tell us our worst fears will come true.\nBut what if we take a quick reframe on anxiety.\nAnxiety means we care. If we do not experience some anxiety, we likely do not care about the outcome.\nResearch indicates some level of anxiety leads to better performance. Yes, you should feel anxious going into that investor pitch or giving that keynote. It means you will be more on your game, more alert, and more engaged in your task at hand.\nTake a few deep breaths and resist the urge to demonize anxiety. You can be both anxious and confident.\n4. Nothing is Precious\nIn college, an art professor of mine used to walk around the room holding a brush loaded with red paint. If she observed you being overly careful with your painting, she would come up behind and slash your work with red color.\nShe would state, \u201cNothing is precious,\u201d and move on about the room.\nI still regularly use this quote all the time. While horrifying at the moment, my professor\u2019s point was being overly precious got in the way of authenticity.\nClients, customers, and audiences can smell bullsh*t from a mile away. Preciousness leads to a focus on perfection. People do not connect to perfection; they connect to authenticity.\nTo be effectively brief, you must be willing to throw things out the window if they do not align with your purpose, your customers, or your mission.\nNothing is precious.\n5. Practice. Then Practice Some More.\nI played baseball as a youth, and my batting skills were average at best. While game-playing skills could improve with team practice, the only way to improve batting was to take swings. Hello, batting cages!\nTo get better at editing for brevity, you need to practice. It does not come intuitively to everyone, especially if you do not have advanced training or experience as a writer.\nWhile many tools, like Grammarly, can help condense our writing, I have found nothing beats the old-fashioned way of the slash \u2018n dash.\nYou can make this process your own as the mechanics are simple: After you write something, whether an email, a speech, an academic paper, or a Medium article, go back and remove at least 25% of it. Slash it.\nWith less frill and fluff, your main thesis will pop and your points will be stronger.\nTrust me.\nWe live in a world where communication is crucial to success. We can take comfort in knowing that concise communication was a challenge for even the Blaise Pascals of the world.\nBy employing a few strategies around editing, staying focused on our mission, and minding our relationships to anxiety and self-confidence, we can improve our ability to say more with less.\nI hope this article has been helpful!

A highly-organized and prolific computer scientist, academic, author, and speaker, Newport is the best-selling writer of numerous books, including Digital Minimalism and Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World. He also hosts a podcast, Deep Questions with Cal Newport, and produces a semi-regular blog.\nFor the better part of a decade, the hustle and grind lifestyle proselytized by Gary Vaynerchuk and many a YouTube tech-bro-wannabe influencer has preached that success only comes with consistent productivity. Nearly 45% of the workforce in the United States proudly claims to identify with hustling and grinding as an approach to work and success.\nA general definition of hustle culture (often used interchangeably with grinding or grind culture) is a lifestyle where work, productivity, and financial success are the main priorities. In hustle culture, hobbies, other leisure activities, or time with family and friends are secondary to the grind. Hustle culture tells us the only way to win and be successful is never to stop producing.\nIf your main hustle isn\u2019t getting you enough, start a side hustle. Start two or three side hustles. If you don\u2019t have what you want, you simply aren\u2019t working hard enough.\nPart of getting pulled into hustle and grind culture isn\u2019t just the drive for success but the need to feel important, special, and one of the elite. After all, Mark Wahlberg wakes up at 2:30 am to start his day, so maybe that\u2019s what I need to do too?\nPerhaps hustling makes you feel important. You have a lot on your plate, and you stand out from the masses because you are superhuman and can do it all. -Bryan E. Robinson, Ph.D.\nSlow productivity takes a dramatically different path. It claims we will be more productive if we slow down and take an organized, intentional approach to our work and goals. We will also produce higher quality work if our pace shifts from a frantic foxtrot to a slow shuffle.\nRise \u2018n Grind\nIf you have somehow managed to escape hustle culture messaging, simply search for daily routine or morning routine on YouTube. A commonly presented routine will look like the following:\nWake up at 4:00 am\nMeditate for an hour\nExercise for an hour\nEat breakfast or shovel exogenous ketones into coffee\nShower and get ready for the day while filming a morning routine vlog\nWork for a full 8+ hour day\nAttend to your side hustle on breaks and lunch\nExercise (again) at the gym\nCome home and eat a slab of elk because hustlers eat carnivore\nFire up one of several devices to make a YouTube video/blog/Substack/Twitch stream\nWork on one of seven side hustles until midnight\nSleep for four hours because hustlers don\u2019t sleep\nEven if we assume 75% of these YouTubers are performative, there are plenty of similar articles right here on Medium and across other platforms extolling the virtues of such \u201cdaily routines.\u201d Popular hustle memes preach the gospel of \u201cWork while they sleep\u201d and \u201cHustle while they party.\u201d\nSorry, but if you are sleeping every night and attending the occasional party, you just aren\u2019t hustling. Guess success isn\u2019t for you!\nThe anti-hustle\nGrind \u2018n hustle culture is certainly not without critique. Jenny Odell\u2019s How to Do Nothing: Resisting the Attention Economy made it onto President Obama\u2019s favorite book list for 2019. More recently, Dr. Devin Price\u2019s Laziness Does Not Exist takes a close examination of the \u201cpsychological underpinnings of the laziness lie.\u201d\nWe are busier than ever, side hustles and all, yet we still don\u2019t feel we are doing enough. Price calls bullsh*t on the concept of laziness and instead turns the spotlight on digital culture\u2019s increasing and exploitative demands for productivity, all to the detriment of our health and wellbeing.\nFun aside: Price\u2019s book started as a Medium article.\nLate night with coffee dregs\nDecember 2016. It\u2019s 1:00 on a Tuesday. I\u2019m positioned at my dining room table, typing away furiously at my laptop and nursing the gritty dregs of yesterday\u2019s coffee. I am determined to submit this manuscript draft before my 3-year-old wakes up. I am both exhausted and exhilarated. I\u2019m in my final edits, and I only need to cobble together a conclusion. The end is merely a pinprick of light in the distance, but, dammit, I can see it.\nI had a goal to submit this paper tonight. Technically, it is the following morning, but my rationale for one continuous night-into-morning grind situation holds solid. It counts.\nExcept, what counts? And to whom?\nFalling into the grind\nWhen I first entered academia, I was pretty green regarding academic writing and publishing pressures. I felt confident about my teaching, advising, and ability to keep up with the new meetings and committees that came with life in higher education. But the publishing world was relatively unknown to me.\nA year into my new position and I had already experienced the wrath of Reviewer 2. A prospective journal unequivocally rejected my first manuscript. Snarky reviewer comments were riddled throughout my writing behind a sheer veil of hypothetical questions. \u201cIs this a typo???\u201d asked Reviewer 2 with a corresponding highlight of the software package I had used to crunch the numbers in my study. Um, no. It was not a typo but thanks for letting me know you think I\u2019m a moron.\nMy anxiety flared following this initial rejection. I had to try harder. I had to work harder. I had to write more. I had to submit more. I had to get organized.\nI created a new schedule and set goals. Publishing in academic journals is typically a very long process. Every semester, I aimed to submit two manuscripts, with no exceptions. I would send out rejected manuscripts again at least two more times before throwing in the towel. When asked, I would complete timely revisions.\nAnd most importantly, I would never ask for extensions.\nEmerging from the grind\nHere\u2019s the part of the story where I\u2019m supposed to tell you this was all for naught. The lesson here is that grinding is bad, and grind culture is toxic and terrible. An oozing, festering sociocultural byproduct of late-stage capitalism constantly pushing to produce more while running on less.\nYes, grind culture is toxic and terrible. I was stressed and exhausted. I was elated when my writing was accepted into publications and anxious with a small side of depression when rejected. It was an emotional ride.\nAnd\u2026it worked. At least for a while.\nIn the handful of years since that frantic late-night-into-early-morning writing session in 2016, with barely any publications to my name, I have published several peer-reviewed articles and book chapters, had accepted encyclopedia entries, and written and published various other writing pieces. While I did not always meet my two-a-semester goal, it was motivating and, more importantly, it seemed to be effective.\nAnd then March 2020 came and everything shut down.\nI thought I would have more time to write after COVID-19 hit. I could even submit three articles per semester! What I expected to be a liberating experience turned into a year of emergency Zoom meetings, homeschooling, and general screen-staring.\nThere was a Road Closed sign smack in the middle of the highway, and I had hit it straight on.\nRegroup, refocus, and slow the hell down\nThe onset of COVID-19 forced me to reexamine many aspects of my life. I stopped writing. I had to focus on other aspects of my job and family life during the initial months of the global crisis. I now had to hustle to find toilet paper and hand sanitizer. It\u2019s incredible how quickly the universe can force a life reprioritization.\nInitially published in 2019, during the first few months of COVID in 2020, I read Digital Minimalism and became familiar with Newport\u2019s work. I took away from that first book the need to step back from all the Google Docs, data processing, and caffeinated late-night writing sessions. I had to stop and take inventory. Take time to reengage with various life components with intentionality and move on from there.\nWhile Digital Minimalism focuses on scaling down our use of technology to improve our work efficiency and overall well-being, slow productivity asks us to reexamine how we set goals and measure productivity.\nIncorporating Slow Productivity and Anti-Busyness\nI have not found the perfect work/life balance. I still struggle with getting pulled into the hustle mindset and have the occasional late-night bursts of writing and production.\nI have, however, found the following components of slow productivity to be helpful. These components are helping to guide me into an intentional, less busyness for busyness sake, approach to work, and productivity.\nRedefine productivity\nA slow productivity approach asks you to rethink what it means to be productive. In the Ferriss podcast, Newport talks about writing manuscripts and books. He talks about how time spent walking in the botanical gardens, thinking about his paper or the next book chapter, counts as productive. It allows him to plan and generate new ideas for his writing. Using my example, I measured my productivity by the number of manuscripts I submitted in one semester. In hindsight, this is a terrible approach as it pays no mind to the writing process itself. This approach to productivity can and did lead to some sloppy work and the need to do even more work through revisions and rewrites. If I had just slowed down in the first place, I would have been more efficient, more careful, and more thorough in my initial piece of writing. I now define one aspect of productivity as the amount of time per day or per week spent writing. A manuscript might take one month, six months, or a whole year to produce. And that\u2019s okay. I respect the writing process by allowing as much time as needed to get to a finished piece.\nLong-term over short-term\nSlow productivity asks us to step back and think about our long-term goals. In hustle culture, we are all about short-term goals. The amount of time grinding every night into the wee hours of the morning or the number of clicks, claps, and comments we get on every Medium article. Short-term goals are motivating, and we don\u2019t need to throw them out the window completely. But we often lose the forest for the trees. After redefining productivity, think about what you want in the long term. For example, if your goal is to become a successful writer, perhaps focus on writing one excellent article or blog post per month rather than three articles every single day. Producing three articles per day might (eventually) make you some money on Medium. But if your long-term goal is to become a book author, the busyness aspect of three articles per day may be taking time away from your ability to meet your ultimate goal. Make sure your short-term and long-term goals are in alignment.\nIntentionality leads to greater productivity\nTake a moment to ponder this head-scratcher: We can produce more with less work. Say what now? Slowing down and acting with intention towards our goals often leads us to create more in less time. Why? Because we take the time to think about a practical approach to meeting our goals. In contrast, hustle culture has us prioritize work for work\u2019s sake. We\u2019re caught in a riptide and frantically splashing around to save ourselves while we gulp water and gasp for air. If only we would slow down, think, and act intentionally, we could swim across the current and avoid drowning. Take the time to stop, think, and swim across that current.\nUse technology wisely\nI would be remiss to leave out Newport\u2019s work around digital minimalism. If you have not yet read the book, I highly recommend it. Of course, you can also find a synopsis of its main points all around the internet if book reading isn\u2019t your thing. Intentionality with technology and digital media can help us work more efficiently and with fewer distractions. Prioritize your work and leisure time so you are in control of technology; technology is not in control of you.\nLearn to Love the Process\nAn old saying goes, \u201cYou can pay your dues and enjoy the fruits of your labor for the rest of your life.\u201d We work hard and, eventually, we get the payoff. Right? Except in hustle culture, the fruits of our labor come in the form of a finish line that keeps moving further and further away. There is never enough money or enough success.\nSlow productivity does not demonize the virtues of hard work. Instead, it encourages us to work hard with measured intensity towards our clarified goals and newly conceptualized notions of productivity. By taking an approach of slow productivity, we may come to a greater appreciation and enjoyment of the creative process and of work itself. We may find our sense of fulfillment doesn\u2019t live in the outcomes; it lives in the process.\nI hope this article has been helpful! If so, consider becoming a Medium member for only $5/month.

And after four long years, it finally happened. Last month, I quit my job at the bank.\nI joined the Great Resignation for a job that offered more flexibility, freedom, and more money. I\u2019d love to say I planned the whole thing. But as Steve Jobs said in his famous speech, \u201cYou can\u2019t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backward.\u201d\nAs hard as it was to see while I was working there, the job I hated put me on the path to a better future. If you\u2019re willing, you can learn a lot from a job you hate. Here\u2019s how to make the most of it while you\u2019re waiting to move forward.\nMake an investment\nA job you hate doesn\u2019t only make you miserable for eight hours a day, it negatively affects the rest of your life. One reason this happens is because you invest so much energy into frustration, resentment, and hate. Soon, you\u2019re wallowing in self-pity about how hard your life is, and that outlook bleeds over into everything.\nBefore long, that job you hate starts to rob you of satisfaction and joy elsewhere in your life. I know because I struggled with it like everyone else. I grew short-tempered with my kids and became uncomfortably accustomed to complaining. It was not how I wanted to spend my life.\nThankfully, I made a game-changing decision soon after I started working.\nTo keep my sanity, I started investing in learning skills I enjoyed. For me, it was writing. I started writing and publishing online regularly. I read books and blogs about writing, and I even invested in courses to help me improve my skills.\nThose investments helped me feel I still had some say in the direction of my life. But here\u2019s the most important part.\nInvesting in those skills didn\u2019t change anything about my job. It gave me something to look forward to after a long day of being abused by clients. It was like I had a secret identity \u2014 corporate drone by day and renegade writer by night.\nA new work opportunity didn\u2019t come for a long time. But small actions can plant the seeds for much larger results later on.\nGet very clear about this\nWhen I started working for the bank in 2018, my commute was over an hour. I know, lots of people commute that long or more every day. But it\u2019s misery when you\u2019re in a job you don\u2019t like and all you can think about is how you\u2019d rather be anywhere else.\nSo I started using the the job I hated get clarity on what I wanted in life.\nWorking in an environment you hate can bring your life into focus. You start seeing what matters, what doesn\u2019t, and where you\u2019re heading if you don\u2019t make some changes.\nI figured out that \u2014 for me \u2014 it was more important to have freedom in my schedule than to climb my way up a corporate ladder. So the skills I chose to invest in (writing) could help me move toward that kind of life.\nI didn\u2019t just sit on my couch and imagine the life I wanted or the work I wanted to do. I clarified it through journaling and writing in detail about what I wanted my future to look like in real life. I \u201cpracticed\u201d living that life on my days off from work by heading to a cafe to write and by working on my side-hustle early in the mornings.\nI let my vision for the future fuel my desire so I would have the energy to work after coming home from a long day. I poured my energy into building the skills that could support the kind of life I wanted.\nLet me be clear: I still had no idea how or if things would ever work out even close to the way I hoped.\nThe realization that made me fearless\nDid you have a least favorite subject in school? Mine was math. Numbers and equations excite me about as much as getting a tetanus shot. Then I got a job in banking\u2013sounds like a good fit, right?\nWhen I started that job, I stepped into an entirely new world. I had no background in the industry and no knowledge of how it worked. I had to learn everything starting at zero.\nBut over my first year as I learned about the complex regulations and procedures of the job, I had a realization.\nI can learn anything.\nThat realization gave me the courage to build new skills and pursue new opportunities in areas I enjoy. Instead of seeing an opportunity as too hard or requiring too much of a learning curve, I find strength in what I\u2019ve been through.\nIf I can learn how to do a job I didn\u2019t like, I can learn how to do anything. So can you.\nThe most important mindset\nWhen you feel stuck, remember: Just because you\u2019re not in a job you love right now doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re wasting your life. Your current situation may not fit your life or career goals, but what you learn in this chapter will help you get to the next.\nTo get the benefits of a job you don\u2019t like, you have to be willing to learn. I won\u2019t pretend I did this perfectly all the time. Most days all I wanted to do was quit. But when you can\u2019t do much about your situation, you can either stay miserable or find ways to make the most of it.\nYou don\u2019t need to be naturally gifted to start investing in skills that interest you. You don\u2019t need to know exactly where you\u2019re going in life to find great opportunities. Nor do you need anyone\u2019s permission to learn something new.\nAll you need to do is start.", "comment_count": 21, "like_count": 1288, "created_time": 1645988399444, "comment": [{"user_id": "54c2d1f1a55d", "comment_time": 1645988399444, "comment": "A Job You Hate Can Teach You So Much"}, {"user_id": "61f91aee0db7", "comment_time": 1646229056467, "comment": "A job You hate can teach you so much- I believe this and I think a lot of people are switching jobs during the pandemic, if only for the better"}, {"user_id": "47b9aff0c9d2", "comment_time": 1646316583519, "comment": "It's hard to feel motivated to work on anything besides the next episode on Netflix after a long work day - but I agree your vision for the future needs to be what fuels you!"}, {"user_id": "6afb13e8c0b1", "comment_time": 1646220463409, "comment": "Well said!

From pandemics to climate change, to politics, to wars, there\u2019s no shortage of doom. It\u2019s no secret our health has suffered over the past few years.\nBut sometimes, in the middle of everything life throws at you, something pierces the hopelessness and gives you a healthy dose of perspective.\nTake, for example, Robert Frost\u2019s answer to a journalist who asked him the most important thing about life. Frost replied, \u201cIn three words, I can sum up everything I\u2019ve learned about life. It goes on.\u201d\nIn a time when life gets more uncertain every day, the importance of Frost\u2019s words is greater than ever.\nThe rest of the story\nRobert Frost was a famous American poet, the only one to receive the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry in his lifetime. If you grew up in the US, you probably remember him from your high school American Literature class.\nHis influence was so great that most high schoolers have to memorize one of his poems (or at least read them). His classics, The Road Not Taken and Stopping By Woods On a Snowy Evening, are required reading for millions of schoolchildren. He even recited one of his poems at John F. Kennedy\u2019s inauguration from memory.\nBorn in California, Frost spent most of his life in the American Northeast, where he wrote most of his work. He knew tremendous loss from childhood, losing his father at age 11, and his mother as a young man. Before he died, he\u2019d lost several children and his wife, Elinor, who died in midlife.\nRobert Frost \u2014 Author via Wikimedia Commons\nFrost lived eighty-eight years, and his quote about life came from his eightieth birthday celebration.\nThe story goes that at Frost\u2019s birthday celebration in 1954, the writer Ray Josephs interviewed Frost for an article in This Week Magazine. Josephs says the conversation went like this.\n\u201cIn all your years and all your travels,\u201d I asked, \u201cwhat do you think is the most important thing you\u2019ve learned about life?\u201d\n[Frost] paused a moment, then with the twinkle sparkling under those brambly eyebrows he replied: \u201cIn three words, I can sum up everything I\u2019ve learned about life. It goes on. In all the confusions of today, with all our troubles\u2026 with politicians and people slinging the word fear around, all of us become discouraged\u2026 tempted to say this is the end, the finish. But life \u2014 it goes on. It always has. It always will.

The problem is, most people who read the Bible rarely recognize how unique some of its contents are. So the Bible grows stale.\nI grew up hearing stories from the Bible, so in some ways I became desensitized to some of the stranger things inside. It\u2019s unfortunate, but when you hear the same stories over and over, you can lose your sense of wonder. Thankfully, it doesn\u2019t have to be that way.\nThe thing I enjoy most about the Bible is learning to read it with fresh eyes. Doing so takes familiar stories you can recite in your sleep and gives them new vitality. One of the best ways to read the Bible with fresh eyes is learning about the language and culture.\nHere are 5 weird Bible verses that will reignite your sense of wonder.\nThe one with the streaker\nThe first time I read the verse below, it made me laugh.\nOne young man following behind was clothed only in a long linen shirt. When the mob tried to grab him, he slipped out of his shirt and ran away naked. (Mark 14:51\u201352)\nThat\u2019s right, this guy literally got scared out of his clothes.\nThis strange verse comes from the betrayal and arrest of Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane. An armed mob arrested Jesus, and his closest followers all ran away. One person even runs away naked.\nI have so many questions here.\nFirst, why was this \u201cyoung man\u201d only wearing a linen shirt? For comparison, it\u2019s like saying the guy was in a nightgown. Anyone out in public would have been wearing more than a long shirt, so this guy clearly wasn\u2019t dressed for the occasion.\nSome commentators think the man woke up in the middle of the night, possibly when the armed crowd passed by his house on their way to arrest Jesus. He rushed out wearing nothing but his night clothes to see what was happening. Sounds reasonable enough.\nSecond, who was this young man?\nAgain, nobody knows for sure because the text doesn\u2019t say. It\u2019s possible he worked in the Garden of Gethsemane, and came out to see what was happening on the grounds.\nHowever, most commentators believe the young man was Mark himself, the writer of the Gospel. Mark was a friend of Jesus\u2019 disciple, Peter, who was also there. He may have written himself into the story to show that he was no more brave than any of Jesus\u2019 other followers. Past embarrassment doesn\u2019t mean God can\u2019t work through you.\nThe one where angels and humans make babies\nIf you\u2019ve ever read in the first book of the Bible, Genesis, this verse might have caught your eye.\nIn those days, and for some time after, giant Nephilites lived on the earth, for whenever the sons of God had intercourse with women, they gave birth to children who became the heroes and famous warriors of ancient times. (Genesis 6:4, NLT)\nOkay so, angels plus humans equals giants. Got it.\nYou can really go down a rabbit hole if you Google this verse, but let\u2019s steer clear of conspiracy theories. As I understand it, the \u201cgiants\u201d aren\u2019t necessarily the overgrown humanoids most of us imagine. A clue to their identity is in the last part of the verse.\nThe offspring of these angels and women were \u201cthe heroes and famous warriors of ancient times.\u201d\nThe original language of Genesis was Hebrew, and the Hebrew word used for \u201cgiant\u201d is gibbor. It means \u201cChampions, heroes, warriors, mighty men.\u201d Why does that matter?\nIt\u2019s impossible to say for sure, but perhaps the result of angels and humans copulating was great warrior heroes, not unlike the heroes and demigods of other ancient cultures. Their stature as giants was more about their great deeds than their physical size.\nOf course, someone will point out that in Numbers 13, the Hebrews feared the descendants of Anak who \u201cCome from the Nephilim,\u201d living in Canaan. The Hebrews claimed they were small as grasshoppers compared to them and refused to go into the Promised Land. But since the Hebrews were supposed to \u201ctake over\u201d Canaan in war, it\u2019s reasonable they were comparing their ability to wage war against these great, experienced warriors.\nOr maybe they were giants. Who knows? That\u2019s what makes reading the Bible fun!\nRegardless, the writer of Genesis wants us to know that God is more powerful than even the ancient heroes. God will prove it in the next verse, which begins the story of Noah.\nThe one with the cannibals\nYes, that\u2019s cannibals\u2013as in flesh-eaters. It\u2019s a familiar verse to most Christians.\nSo Jesus said again, \u201cI tell you the truth, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you cannot have eternal life within you.\u201d (John 6:53)\nUm \u2014 excuse me?\nChristians today accept this as part of Jesus\u2019 explanation for Holy Communion, the practice of eating bread and drinking wine (or grape juice) to remember the life and work of Jesus. But that isn\u2019t clear from this verse alone.\nSome even accused early Christians of cannibalism. But every religion has practices that outsiders can\u2019t understand. And it\u2019s unlikely the idea of eating a god\u2019s body was new.\nIn the Ancient Near East, some religions practiced eating and drinking the body and blood of a god. People believed it gave them the powers of a god.\nFor example, take the Greek celebration of Dionysus. It was a fertility ritual where participants drank wine. They believed the wine was Dionysus\u2019 blood and perhaps it helped with fertility.\nHowever, the Christian Eucharist or Holy Communion isn\u2019t about taking on the \u201cpowers\u201d of Jesus. The bread and wine used represent \u2014 or become, for Catholics \u2014 the body and blood of Jesus, sacrificed on the Cross to save the world. It is an act of gratitude for Jesus\u2019 sacrifice.\nThe one where they cut a deal\nThe entire biblical narrative revolves around a covenant. That doesn\u2019t mean much to us in the Twenty-First Century because we don\u2019t have covenants anymore, not like in the Bible, at least.\nToday, we make deals, we sign contracts, or enter a legal agreement certified by a notary public. A biblical covenant is all those things together and then some.\nOne of the most important covenants in the Bible is God\u2019s covenant with Abram (later Abraham). God made a covenant and promised Abram he will be the founding father of Israel. Here\u2019s how it went down:\nThe Lord told him, \u201cBring me a three-year-old heifer, a three-year-old female goat, a three-year-old ram, a turtledove, and a young pigeon.\u201d So Abram presented all these to him and killed them. Then he cut each animal down the middle and laid the halves side by side\u2026 After the sun went down and darkness fell, Abram saw a smoking firepot and a flaming torch pass between the halves of the carcasses. (Genesis 15:9\u201310, 17, NLT)\nOkay, I cheated a little with this one and threw in an extra verse or two. But I want you to see what\u2019s happening here\u2013chopped up animals and smoking firepots.\nBefore the days of written contracts, promises between two parties needed to make sure each side held up the deal. When people made a covenant in the Bible, they\u2019d cut sacrificial animals in half and arrange them in an aisle. It may sound grizzly, but it makes sense.\nIn this type of covenant, each party would walk between the cut halves and swear to uphold their part of the covenant, or face the same fate as the sacrificed animals. Not a bad incentive.\nIn God\u2019s covenant with Abram, God appears as a \u201csmoking firepot\u201d and walks down the aisle. God \u201ccovenants\u201d with Abram to make him the founding father of a nation. But God does not ask Abram to walk down the bloody aisle. Abram is under no obligation to uphold his end of the covenant.\nGod wants Abram to know God is trustworthy. Even if Abram fails (and he does), God swears to uphold God\u2019s promises.\nThe one with the weaklings\nEnglish-speaking readers of the Bible can\u2019t understand all the choices a translator has to make when translating the original Hebrew or Greek text.\nWords in Greek and Hebrew can have multiple meanings in the same context, and translators can only choose one. So, when you read a translation of the Bible, you don\u2019t get all the rich layers of meaning some Bible verses hold. Let me give you a great example.\n\u201cBlessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.\u201d (Matthew 5:5, NRSV)\nThis verse comes from Jesus\u2019 Sermon on the Mount, one of the most popular sections in the Bible. He suggests that, in God\u2019s Kingdom, the gentle and submissive will rule the world. There\u2019s some good theological truth to that, but it doesn\u2019t cover everything.\nThe Greek word for \u201cmeek\u201d is one of those with many possible meanings. It can mean \u201cgentle,\u201d but another translation could be, \u201cBlessed are those who know how to control their strength.\u201d\nIn short, the meekness Jesus blesses means showing power without unnecessary harshness.\nExpressing power through manipulation and control is not the way of Jesus. Let that sink in.\nThis is why weird verses are the best\nI enjoy finding ways to read the Bible with fresh eyes. Sometimes you can see things one way for so long, you can lose your sense of wonder. It\u2019s difficult to look at it from a different angle. When you do, it can change your faith.\nThe ability to read the Bible from different perspectives is how you grow in your faith. Reading the Bible with fresh eyes can breathe life into faith that has grown too stale and routine.", "comment_count": 19, "like_count": 911, "created_time": 1651021384058, "comment": [{"user_id": "54c2d1f1a55d", "comment_time": 1651021384058, "comment": "Thank you for sharing!"}, {"user_id": "a74e1afa515f", "comment_time": 1651128446693, "comment": "Me too.

I\u2019m not kidding.\nFor example, in just 10 years, jobs in the legal industry have been transformed largely due to the increased application of legal software systems. The result is fewer highly-paid legal jobs, reduced demand for law school graduates, and the emergence of a higher volume of low-paying jobs to complete legal tasks aided by software systems (such as e-Discovery review at ~$30/hr).\nThe half-life of talent is scary and has to be faced. Artificial intelligence, software, automation and robots are changing every job, blue and white collar alike.\nThe pace of technology is such that newer ways of working, newer literacies, newer competencies are showing up every day. If solutions are not created, as a society we will be faced with mass unemployment, decreased quality of life and increased poverty.\nGood work is being done on many fronts: in policy, on the front-lines managing a business\u2019s talent pool, operating workforce development agencies, delivering higher education, building talent recruiting systems, and so on.\nBut which of these solutions is really going to make a dent in this problem? Which initiatives are the ones to support and invest in?\nIn this article learn about structural solutions that have the potential to massively change outcomes in reducing human obsolescence.\nWhat is \u201cStructural\u201d Change?\nLet\u2019s start with a case study that demonstrates the jaw-dropping power of structural change from the manufacturing industry.\nUntil the 1980s, the US manufacturing industry was leading the world. US manufacturers believed that there is a firm tradeoff between Quality and Cost. The manufacturing department and the quality department were two separate entities, and if higher quality products were to be shipped to customers, more products found their way into the rejects pile. Supporting this world view was a wealth of related business management techniques.\nHigher quality products meant incurring higher costs. Producing lower cost products meant lower quality. It felt like a universal truth.\nJapanese manufacturers were known for shoddy, low cost manufacturing. In the 1940s they sought to change this. Using little-used research that had, in fact, originated in the US, they eliminated the quality department. Instead they imbued quality across the entire manufacturing process, applying Statistical Quality Control methods to identify and remediate the sources of defects along the entire manufacturing chain. They invented the business practices of Total Quality Management, lean manufacturing, and kaizen. These methods worked incredibly well and by the 1970s Japanese companies were eating the lunch of US manufacturers who lamented If the Japanese Can\u2026 Why Can\u2019t We?.\nJapanese companies showed manufacturing could be done with higher quality AND lower cost. This way of managing manufacturing has become standard operating practice for manufacturing everywhere. The cost and quality tradeoff was broken.\nStructural Change Ideas for Labor & Work Markets\nBig problems require structural change.\nThe question is, what are the structural changes that could stop human obsolescence? What are the breakthrough ideas that apply to labor?\nHere\u2019s an initial list of 5 areas to look at \u2014 with initial ideas described\u2014 and I\u2019m looking for more.\n1. Blur the line between learning and working\nThere has always been a tradeoff being learning and working: invest in learning and THEN work; invest in a college degree and then you\u2019ll get a better paying job; give employees time off from work to complete training.\nWe could simply accept this tradeoff: let people try harder to manage a part-time job while studying, or provide online learning that can be juggled with a job.\nThe structural question asks, though: how might we actually break the tradeoff between learning and working?\nApprenticeships for white collar work.\nLearning is defined as acquiring knowledge and being able to subsequently apply it in new situations. Last year Accenture spent $950M in class-based training of 440,000 employees. When they reviewed the impact \u2014 using a rubric of 8 elements of durable knowledge \u2014 they discovered that their programs were failing: only 25% of their programs made the cut, and none excelled. Neuroscience tells us several pertinent ideas:\n(1) The brain is plastic throughout life, not just when young; (2) Learning is not measured in training hours but in attentive moments; in those attentive moments learning happens very fast; (3) Learning requires oxytocin, a primary modulator of brain rewiring, which increases when the learner feels trust and falls when the learner feels fear; (4) learning is boosted through constructive criticism, or corrective feedback, especially if the learner has a growth mindset. (My thanks to Dean Dan Schwartz, Dean of the Stanford Graduate School of Education, whose lecture I attended).\nThese are hall-marks of apprenticeship programs where a learner is working on actual work, in a trusted environment, to learn a particular skill or set of skills from someone who already has mastery. While common in trades, the apprenticeship model could be applied to white collar work. Rather than going off to \u201cdo training\u201d, completing an apprenticeship within the workplace might have a higher impact in achieving learning outcomes.\n10 year degrees.\nBill Gates and others recommend we spend 5 hours per week to learn something new. Professor Tyler Cowan (author of Average is Over) urges us to retrain ourselves every 3- 5 years. \u201cBecoming life long learners\u201d is a well-used mantra in the media and amongst teaching professionals.\nAchieving this requires good intentions to follow through \u2014 and only a small percentage of people can actually do this.\nMy MBA at Harvard Business School took almost 2 years. What if Harvard Business School made its MBA not a 2-year degree but a 10 year one? 1 year on campus coupled with additional learning over the next 9 years. Employers employing a Harvard MBA would know their new hire is going to stay current. I wonder if large employers of business management personnel (such as General Electric, McKinsey, Bain Consulting and Accenture, to mention just a few) would support this?\nWhile I use the example of the MBA, this could be applied to all kinds of degrees. Rather than individuals stringing together \u201clife long learning\u201d in an ad hoc way, life long learning would become a systematic focused effort. Rather than life long learning relying on \u201cgood intentions\u201d this could systematically entrench \u201clife long learning\u201d into the fabric of work.\n2. \u201cLearning is expensive\u201d\nWe believe that learning is expensive, due to the tuition and time spent, and we are unsure of the returns. Embarking on a course of learning is fraught with friction.\nWe know however that being able to afford to learn is orthogonal to the ROI of learning. Having financial commitments (like supporting yourself, supporting a family, or commitment to a mortgage) is a circumstantial fact. People with these circumstances are not less capable or less motivated to become more relevant in the workforce.\nTaking financing out of the decision to re-train makes huge sense.\nFinancial arrangements tied to future earning.\nBoot camps focused on training people for technology sector jobs are leading the way in de-coupling the cost of tuition from the desire to learn. Income-sharing agreements eliminate upfront tuition and replaces it with future payments calculated as a percentage of future earnings.\nFor example, Flatiron\u2019s deferred tuition program allows students to pay $2,000 upfront then 10% of their income once they start to earn at least $40k, for a period of 4 years with a cap on the total paid.\nSome even offer a living stipend in return for a share of future earnings (see details from Flatiron, Lambda School, and others). These kinds of financial arrangements for training in other sectors would systematically increase the flow of motivated students into learning endeavors.\n3. Learning benefits are \u201cunique\u201d to each learner\nThere is a belief that the value of training is hard to measure and benefits are hard to quantify. You\u2019ll hear comments that it depends a lot on the individual concerned, and of successful people who gained success despite their lack of specific training. This creates an overall lack of accountability between training and impact. According to this thinking, learners are such individual snowflakes that the impact of a program of training can\u2019t be predicted. This leads to a general environment in which learners invest in learning activities as a leap of faith, having to believe they will get a sufficient ROI. Any kind of investment falls under circumstances of uncertainty. Structural changes would work to reduce the environment of uncertainty.\nMandatory impact/outcome data for training programs.\nMany consumer products like cars, fitness supplements or wrinkle-creams exist in a world where decisions are made in the midst of massive marketing expenditures, and buyers muddle through claims and endorsements made by vendors to make their ultimate decisions.\nLearning is however a massively high stakes decision. Buyers can\u2019t see through advertising claims. Vendors that offer training people, must talk about the success and failure modes of their offering. This should be information that is freely and cleanly available in all industries, regardless of the institution type, for profit or non profit, or length of the training.\nAn example of how this could be done: Coursereport.com covers one sliver of the technology labor market: entry level jobs in web development, mobile applications, data science, UX design, digital marketing, product management, and cybersecurity. The site covers for-profit bootcamps that operate in this field. The site provides easy to read information about graduation rate, employment rate, salary, and unstructured information in the form of Yelp-like user reviews. Coursereport.com gets about 250,000 visitors/month who spend an average of 2 minutes on the site, reading 2.5 pages. Others like Switchup.org provide rankings as well.\nAnother example: YearUp uses the gold-standard \u2014 a Random Controlled Test. It\u2019s clear which kinds of students are the \u201cinputs\u201d to the program, what the training is, and what impact was created. While the results need to be boiled down for the lay-person to understand and posted more prominently on the website, kudos to YearUp on measuring and reporting the impact of the training program.\n4. Stop treating hiring as an art: tighten the link between skills and jobs\nThe college admission process in the US looks very different from other countries. There\u2019s a spectrum of how predictable the process is for high school students seeking admission to college. The US process is at one end of the spectrum \u2014 more subjective and less predictable \u2014 while other countries at the other other end, with a process that is less subjective and more predictable. It\u2019s actually a structural choice.\nThe hiring process can be thought of on the same spectrum. Currently it is skewed towards being more subjective and less predictable. We might want to make it less subjective and more predictable. Doing so would reduce the uncertainty around undertaking training efforts to stay relevant for new tasks and new jobs.\nHere are two ideas around reducing subjectivity, and I\u2019m curious about others:\nDemonstrate or prove skills as part of job applications.\nSkills can be gained in any number of settings: at a school (well ranked or unknown), through employment, or in a non-traditional setting such as volunteering. Many of these ways of acquiring skills tend to be overlooked in the hiring process. Job applications could require a micro-task to be completed, and the candidate\u2019s performance on the assessment task heavily weighted in the filtering process.\nSeveral technology companies work on this kind of candidate assessment process \u2014 Pymetrics, Aspiring Minds and many other providers.\nI wondered, would I mind being asked to prove my own abilities in, say product design? Would I be affronted being asked to demonstrate something I\u2019ve done for years? Or would I go ahead and take the test? I think it would take some getting used to the first time, but in the end I\u2019d be ok with it.\nProvide Applicant Tracking Systems with more recent, diverse data.\nDue to the internet, the volume of job applications received by employers exponentially increased. The initial wave of Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) managed workflows and were based on simplifying specific HR tasks, for instance, narrowing down a high volume of applicants to a short-list of candidates to screen using Boolean (key word) search tools.\nThe latest ATS systems use machine learning to determine a subset of candidates that would match a particular role, but without being tied to explicit Boolean search terms. Instead, data about existing employees is used to detect similar characteristics in the applicants.\nHowever, newly acquired skills don\u2019t make it into the process that machine learning is operating on. The machine learning algorithms are looking at past data about current employees. Someone completing a new bootcamp might have acquired excellent skills for a particular role, but the training data for the machine learning algorithm has never seen this in its dataset before and therefore can not weight it.\nCan we train machine learning algorithms to be more \u201cpresent\u201d rather than backward looking? We could, using the outcomes from candidate assessments as training data. If current employees and prospective applicants both take the same assessments, the patterns in this data would allow better detection of strong candidates in the applicant pool by the machine learning algorithm.\n5. Re-think what makes an employer a good place to work\nEmployers strive to be a good place to work. I have two structural changes around how changes in the employer environment can overall improve the ability for individuals to remain productive and less likely to become obsolete:\nForced Brutal Honesty.\nInformation dissemination isn\u2019t as clear as you\u2019d think. At Siebel Systems I led the creation of Employee Relationship Management, an enterprise software product which aligned employees around company goals (similar to OKRs) and engaged managers and employees in quick, useful dialogs around performance. This was in response to almost all employees in large companies agreeing with the statement \u201cI don\u2019t know how what I do fits into the company\u2019s direction\u201d, despite immense efforts by management to communicate with employees.\nMaking information crystal clear when it comes to individual productivity could be a place to start. Imagine receiving your W2 each year, along with a brutally honest answer to a single question:\n\nNo matter how nice the manager, the work environment, the current work or the current pay, the answer to this question matters. Anything less than \u201cprobably\u201d is going trigger the individual into thinking about and (possibly) taking action on how to become more valuable.\nAT&T and IBM have started down this path, announcing to large numbers of employees that they are in positions that are going to become obsolete, while launching paths for those employees to re-train to the jobs that are emerging.\nRemote first.\nRemote work has emerged in response to talent shortages in some locations, because relocating talent isn\u2019t that easy. Yet remote employees (or remote contractors) are usually not as productive as those in the office. Many top-notch employees would rather be onsite at a company than work remote for a different company because it doesn\u2019t feel impactful to be remote. Promotions come more slowly. Knowledge transfer is lack luster. Taking a remote job can feel like a compromise.\nCould we structurally accelerate the emergence of remote-first companies, that are centered around the productivity of remote employees? What if remote-first companies \u2014 say, those with 90%+ employees remote \u2014 got a significant tax break? Companies would invest in systems to produce productive outcomes with remote employees, and the tax break would allow them to be more competitive than others without remote workforces.\nWhere Next?\nI believe the way forward is to be very clear that we\u2019re looking for structural change. Structural changes make a huge difference, yet don\u2019t rely on the good intentions of individuals or the power of marketing. The problem of impending human obsolescence requires it.\nWith a good set of candidate solutions in hand, the next step is to run experiments to test the ideas. This is analogous to the first factories in Japan where US researchers (Deming & company) applied their statistical control theories to improve manufacturing quality.\nWith promising experimental results, we can amplify that knowledge to speed implementation by others.\nThe Total Quality Management story is one of 40 years. But we can go faster. I\u2019m excited about the path ahead. Please let me know what you think.\nContinue the discussion (Twitter)\nSunita Parbhu is a seasoned startup product executive with expertise in labor markets.

Our previous post covered lessons #1 to #3. In this article, we continue with lessons #4 to #10.\nAbout the authors: Georgiana Mirea was SVP Product at Dapper Labs and a member of its advisory board. Meanwhile, Sunita Parbhu transitioned from VP Product in Web 2.0, to working in blockchain last year. We tackled this problem for ourselves and have written this guide from our experience.\nLesson #4: Understand DeFi or NFTs\nGo deep into one of these, each is a world in itself. It\u2019s hard to go deep into both, so start with one.\nIf you have a finance background or are already a crypto-trader, you might find it easier to delve into DeFi. Whereas if you have a consumer product background, you might find it more intuitive to delve into NFTs.\nNFTs\nUntil now the Non-Fungible Token world has been driven by games, collectibles, entertainment and art, so if you are passionate about any of these definitely check it out. There are other areas like real estate and climate, where NFTs could flourish.\nGood overviews:\na16z for NFTs:https://future.a16z.com/nft-canon/\nhttps://hbr.org/2021/11/making-sense-of-the-nft-marketplace\nHow to Make Your Own NFT Right Now \u2022 Benzinga\nPlay with the products:\nOpenSea, the largest NFT marketplace\nNBA Top Shot | Officially Licensed Digital Collectibles\nGame-Fi (play-to-earn) \u2014 the gamification of financial mechanisms where users can earn profits by playing games. Objects in the game are expressed as NFTs and require tokens. If you\u2019re a gamer you\u2019ll instantly see the differences and potential. Search for games by market cap, users, a game on a specific blockchain, or for themes you enjoy.\nDeFi\nIt\u2019s easy to quickly understand the idea of DeFi. These links help you go deeper and get your head around the most important concepts.\nStart by thoroughly understanding liquidity pools. A liquidity pool is a collection of funds locked in a smart contract. It\u2019s a fundamental blockchain concept so be sure to thoroughly understand this before continuing.\nWhat Are Liquidity Pools in DeFi and How Do They Work? (Binance Academy).\nThen move on:\nWhat Is an Automated Market Maker (AMM)? (Binance Academy)\nAMM is a concept that doesn\u2019t exist in traditional finance. Traditional finance has a traditional order book where buyers and sellers place orders and wait for them to be filled as matches are made. AMMs replace the notion of an order book by an algorithm that always quotes prices to all buyers and sellers. One of the earliest, most famous AMMs is Uniswap. There\u2019s an explosion in this area, as you can see from this list of others, including dydx, Pancake Swap, etc: List of Decentralized Exchanges.\nThe Difference between Staking vs Yield Farming vs Liquidity Mining-\u2014 (blockchain-council.org). Token are digital assets. Staking, yield farming, and liquidity mining are all ways of putting idle digital assets to work. DeFi users can choose to act as underwriters in decentralized mutual insurance pools, provide liquidity to AMMs (via either liquidity mining or yield farming), or serve as creditors and earn governance tokens in the process. Some will decide to stake & run validator nodes for block rewards. The APYs are often lucrative and there are hundreds of different options out there. There are risks to consider and it\u2019s always worth asking why your tokens are needed and how the yield is generated.\nThe Brilliance of Yield Farming, Liquidity Providing and Valuing Crypto Projects | blog maverick (Mark Cuban)\n7 Indicators Every DeFi Investor Should Know | Binance Academy\nList of Decentralized Exchanges \u2014 Best DEX Decentralized exchanges (defiprime.com) There are a ridiculous number of exchanges!\nIf you want to get hands on:\nUniswap Liquidity Provider Tutorial \u2014 Earn DEX Trading Fees (defirate.com).

This reason is that it doesn\u2019t help you develop deep expertise, so reading this makes a lot more sense once you have laid the foundations.\nSpend 30\u201360 minutes every day catching up with what is happening, but don\u2019t get derailed by it.\nThe worlds of crypto and blockchain are different to what you\u2019re used to. For example, some of the important players are completely anonymous: you\u2019ll see them giving their thoughts at a conference using their pseudonym without revealing their face. If you haven\u2019t ever worked on open source software, you\u2019ll find it eye-opening to see how communities engage to push projects forward.\nHere\u2019s a quick list of places to engage some of your attention:\nTwitter \u2014 Culture & Personalities\nFollow a few people on Twitter to get a sense of what is going on. These tweets can literally drive you crazy and have you online until 4am every night. Protect your time, but follow a few people to get a sense of the world you\u2019re moving into.\nYou\u2019ll start to notice the fervor of some of the projects. You\u2019ll also be puzzled by the much lower engagement of seemingly \u201cserious\u201d projects, at least on Twitter.\nSee who we follow at @gmirea and @sparbhu.\nTelegram and Discord \u2014 Community\nJoin the Discord and Telegram channels of several projects. You\u2019ll start to understand what is normal behavior, as well as understand the power of communities.\nEmail Subscriptions \u2014 As it Happens Content\nSubscribe to a few sources. This content isn\u2019t about deep fundamentals, but it will help you build your feel for the space. Below are some we like which provide a good mix and, in the end, you will figure out what resonates with you. Here are some we like:\nCoinDesk: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Crypto News (daily). Big headlines, funding, regulatory.\nThe Block\nBlockworks Newsletter\nBankless (banklesshq.com)\nCoindesk \u2014 First Mover (daily, Omkar Godbole). Market moves. Not too relevant but worth glancing at to see what traders are talking about.\nCointelegraph\nFigment \u2014 Building Web 3 \u2014 really good to keep on top of what is happening on the various protocols\nInside Cryptocurrency (Inside.com)\nReal Vision Crypto\nMonthly / Quarterly Content\nApart from the daily content, you also want to sit down with meatier content every so often.\nvitalik.eth on Twitter \u2014 deep papers, fun to read and thoughtful. We have Vitalik\u2019s twitter page bookmarked, to go straight to his content without getting distracted by all the rest.\nCoinbase \u2014 really good quarterly content that synthesizes trends in the industry.\nConsensys \u2014 also really good quarterly content: https://consensys.net/reports/web3-report-q3-2021/?\nBankless \u2014 excellent longer content in interviews (Youtube). Their interview of Hayden Adams is worth watching.\nPodcasts\nOur favorites: The BreakDown , The Scoop, Unchained and Bankless.\nSome of our favorite podcasts\nConferences\nAttend a conference. You\u2019ll figure out very quickly how people interact and how quickly things are moving. It\u2019s like arriving in a new country and leaving your hotel \u2014 you\u2019ll grow a lot by participating.\nConsensys Conference \u2014 if you can, attend all 3 days and listen to everything. Consensus 2022 will be in person in NYC. There may be web-access as well. (Here\u2019s an example from their 2021 conference: Money, Monetary Policy, and Bitcoin | Ray Dalio at Consensus 2021)\nList of Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Conferences in 2022 (decemberlabs)\nLesson #6: Understand Project/Company Types\nThere are a few types of projects to understand.\nHardcore layer 1. These are knee-deep in consensus mechanisms. These are the most technically complex projects. They tend to be decentralized and open source, though not all are. DAOs and Foundations are prevalent.\nCentralized crypto world. These are for-profit companies, not DAOs or Foundations. e.g. Coinbase, Binance, FTX. These are most similar to how you\u2019ve operated to date.\nEnterprises using blockchain to solve problems such as supply chain. Look at Hyperledger, Circle stablecoin, and tool providers such as Alchemy. IBM also has several partners doing interesting things such as Food Trust (a permissioned blockchain for tracking the movement of food through the supply chain) and Maersk\u2019s TradeLens (for connecting cargo supply chain).\nApplications \u2014 built on one or more layer 1 blockchains. E.g. Filecoin, DapperLabs\u2019 various games.\nProviders \u2014 ecosystem providers, which are providing services. e.g. Chainalysis, Figment.io.\nIf you\u2019re interested in working on the exchange problem, you\u2019ll see that there\u2019s completely different ways that you could work on the problem:\nCentralized \u2014 Coinbase, Binance\nDecentralized \u2014 Uniswap, Pancake Swap, Sushiswap\nLesson #7: Study Counter-arguments and Risks\nRead views that expose some of the risks and issues. Here are a few that are well thought through and well written.\nMy first impressions of web3 \u2014 well articulated by the founder of Signal, Moxie Marlinspike (super smart)\nWeb3 No Mercy / No Malice (Scott Galloway)\nNaval Ravikant and Chris Dixon Didn\u2019t Explain Any Web3 Use Cases ( Liron Shapira, Oct, 2021)\nDSHR\u2019s Blog: Stanford EE380 Talk\n\u2018Scammi-ness\u2019\nUnderstand the shady side of blockchain and crypto! This is not to dampen your interest, but to keep yourself educated and have your eyes open. If you go into this world, you want to be careful about where you work and what the people you work with, are doing. The kinds of things that happen routinely include:\nA product lead who front ran NFT sales on OpenSea for personal gain\nSophisticated rug-pulls where insiders cash out their tokens at high prices, at the expense of investors (here\u2019s one example)\nDecentralized DAO-run projects that fail to pay their community members for the work they contributed.\nHacks \u2014 CoinDesk reports on some of the bigger hacks\nRug Pulls & Other Scams: The Biggest Threat to Trust in Cryptocurrency: Rug Pulls Put 2021 Scam Revenue Close to All-time High (Chainalysis)\n\u200b\u200bI Worked Full Time in Crypto for Two Years and Didn\u2019t Really Like What I Saw | by Vanalli | The Startup | Medium\nIf you worked in the early days of ad-tech, this landscape will feel familiar: frenzied activity, and a space crowded with both gems and ultra-shady projects!\nLesson #8: Regulation\nRegardless of where you want to work in the space, get acquainted with regulation. You might not be a lawyer or want to get involved in these topics, however it\u2019s a huge part of the landscape and can cause your project/company to fail or succeed.\nUnfortunately, every country has a different stance. So your research may depend on which country or countries you are most interested in. Asia is completely different to the US, which is different than Europe.\nWe don\u2019t have a lot of content in this area yet, but here are a couple of good links to learn about the US environment:\nCryptocurrencies And The Securities And Exchange Commission\nhttps://future.a16z.com/podcasts/crypto-at-congress-watershed-moment-for-regulation-and-web3/\nLesson #9: Consider DAOs\nDecentralized Autonomous Organizations are one of the most fascinating areas in web3!

No-one knows everything and things are moving very fast. Talking to others helps you build your own knowledge and create \u201cA-ha!\u201d moments. At the same time, your perspective and questions helps others as well. So don\u2019t be afraid \u2014 reach out!\nRoles\nAt this point you\u2019ve armed yourself with enough information to decide what you think of blockchain, crypto and web3, and might be thinking about a career change. There is a mind-boggling array of good options! Here\u2019s a few questions to think about when creating a short-list of targets:\nStart up / emerging project, or a big established project?\nDo you want to work in an org that is centralized, or will you try working in a decentralized org? (you won\u2019t know how well you enjoy a decentralized structure unless you try it out)\nDefi or NFT or Gaming/Metaverse? Which of these do you want to be in the middle of? What excites you the most to go deeper into? For example, if you are interested in architecture as a passion, combine the best of both things that you love and look for NFT projects in the area of building worlds.\nConsumer or enterprise?\nHow close to the tech do you want to be? Do you want to be at a layer 1 protocol, or higher up the ecosystem chain?\nDo you want to take a risk? Committing to one of the layer 1 projects is riskier than, for instance, working on an enabler such as an exchange or analytics project.\nWhat role would you like to play \u2014 product? Most of these projects also have huge needs in marketing, community, growth, and general management. Our advice is don\u2019t worry so much about your title. Focus on problems that the project needs to solve and see if you can be helpful. If you are a PM, are you willing to re-purpose your product talents to one of these roles? These roles are mission-critical, which is a responsibility that PMs thrive on. Since this is early stage technology work, whatever role you take on, there\u2019s a a ton of cross-functional interaction to be successful, and even if you\u2019re not \u201cin product\u201d you\u2019re going to spend a lot of your time helping the product team. For instance, if you\u2019re running community, your job is to grow and support the community. You\u2019re also going to be thinking about how are you going to get feedback from the community into the rest of the organization, including product? Coming from a product background you\u2019re going to be really good at solving this.\nHere\u2019s a couple of posts that have been helpful when thinking about roles:\nWhere and Why do Blockchain Projects need Product Managers?

It\u2019s a hill to climb, but you can do it!\nLesson 1: Commit to Usage\nYou\u2019ll internalize Web3 concepts by playing with products. It\u2019s hugely valuable to be hands on.\nWhat to do if you\u2019re not already engaged:\nObtain a wallet. Create a wallet on Metamask. Also create other wallets (like Celo, Algorand, Terra) to see how their onboarding experience differ.\nBuy some crypto. Funding wallets via wires is generally a pain. To get going instantly, use the in-built services that let you buy crypto using your credit card. They\u2019re expensive to use on an ongoing basis, but okay to use when you\u2019re just starting out.\nStick with Metamask and do some transactions, such as transferring between it and your other wallets. Or have a friend transact with you. You can use ETH, but then use a blockchain other than Ethereum. You\u2019ll see transaction costs are much lower on other chains, meaning you\u2019ll be able to play around a lot more for little cost.

Even if you\u2019re a consumer/app PM, and think you\u2019ll \u201cstay in the front end\u201d in web3, you still need to do this.\nHere are courses we\u2019ve taken and liked.\nStanford: Blockchain and Cryptocurrency: What You Need to Know | Stanford Online. It gave an excellent coverage of blockchain fundamentals including cryptography. It is a little dated (2018,) so it predates 2021\u2019s rise of DeFi and NFTs. But it does predict both! The fundamentals haven\u2019t changed \u2014 and it\u2019s quick \u2014 so is worth doing. It\u2019s fun to learn from Dan Boneh, Juan Benet, Fred Ehrsam and Matt Huang. There\u2019s a lengthy amount of regulatory content from a US perspective.\nColumbia Business School: Blockchain in Business. Gives an excellent grounding in the fundamentals of blockchain, including cryptography, which is essential if you want to really understand the space. You can also learn that from OGs Scott W. Stornetta and Stuart Haber. It covered various types of blockchain \u2014 permissioned / permissionless, public / private and also digs into governance. When we took it, it did not cover NFTs.\nWe\u2019re looking at new courses, and we\u2019ll post updates as we verify other courses that we like, for their coverage of the fundamentals, as well as ease of use. For example, https://www.pompscryptocourse.com/\n\ud83d\udca1Tip!

Solving this problem is really the domain of low-level engineers, so you\u2019re not likely going to have a strong opinion on which chain truly has winning technology. But get familiar with this tension, as it will help you better categorize different Layer 1 projects.\nBlockchain Trilemma: Scaling and Security Issues (Gemini)\nWhat Is the Blockchain Trilemma? (shrimpy.io)\nLayer 1 Chains\nRead through the home pages of several Layer 1 blockchain projects and see the variety of different approaches. Basically, at the moment it\u2019s Ethereum on the one hand vs. everyone else trying to be better than Ethereum.\nLook at some with the largest market cap: Solana, Cardano, Avalanche, Algorand\nLook at some of the specialized, well reputed ones: Celo, Flow, Polkadot\nLook at ICP (because it is so well funded and has a completely different approach to other layer 1s)\nLook at Filecoin (because it serves a useful function: storage, and they have excellent documentation)\nAs you review these, you will find that there\u2019s completely different approaches, and sometimes contradictory ones. For instance, Ethereum 2.0 is based on sharding, as is Harmony and NEAR, while Flow (from Dapper Labs) and Mina employs no sharding. Polkadot was started to provide a multi-chain or parachain approach.\nhttps://medium.com/the-capital/layer-1-vs-layer-2-what-you-need-to-know-about-different-blockchain-layer-solutions-69f91904ce40\nSpend time on one of the main blockchain scanners \u2014 or the scanner of any chain you are interested in:\nhttps://btc.com/en\nhttps://etherscan.io/\nConclusion\nWe\u2019ve found it\u2019s important to be wide and deep, and to not get stuck in rabbit holes.

Was this attack an ominous milestone for the crypto currency sector; an example of a new threat? Was what happened a crime, like theft? Or was it simply a dramatic play by a sharp operator or operators?\nI\u2019ll break down this attack on CREAM Finance step-by-step, so you can build your knowledge and ultimately understand what the risks are for yourself because unfortunately this probably won\u2019t be the last time it happens. Indeed, two similar attacks did take place earlier this year, in which attackers took off with a total of $56.3 million. But the attack on CREAM Finance is by far the biggest of its type we\u2019ve seen to date, in dollar terms.\nThe WHAT\nCREAM Finance is a DeFi lending protocol for individuals, institutions, and other protocols to access decentralized financial services. This attack on it was carried out using advanced programmatic trading to place orders on exchanges (that is, it wasn\u2019t executed by manually placing trading orders on exchanges but via a software program).\nWhat happened in the attack on CREAM Finance, was really nothing new: it was a form of arbitrage. Arbitrage is the practice of borrowing money to trade any kind of asset (like a stock, a currency, a bond, etc.), in order to take advantage of differing prices for that asset on various exchanges. Price discrepancies may exist for only a few seconds \u2014 or less.\nA discrepancy in price can be minuscule fractions of a cent, but when executed at scale it rapidly adds up to millions in profit. This is what we saw in the attack on CREAM Finance.\nBy the way, arbitrage is not a crypto-only phenomenon. It\u2019s been taking place probably for as long as exchanges have existed. Indeed, there are massive financial firms that specialize in arbitrage. As an example, a single firm may manage over $1 billion in digital assets and trade $1\u201310 billion per day across thousands of crypto products, all through the use of programmatic trading. (Alongside these are retail traders who implement similar arbitrage strategies but not nearly at the same scale).\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that arbitraging doesn\u2019t require expertise in the cryptocurrency tokens themselves. The arbitrageurs didn\u2019t need to know about the tokens or hold any views on their long-term potential. They only cared that there was a price discrepancy of tokens in different markets. So they took advantage.\nThe HOW\nA stand-out element of the DeFi attack on CREAM is that the attackers employed something called a flash loan to fund their transactions.\nA flash loan is an innovation of DeFi finance. A flash loan enables borrowing \u2014 without collateral or credit checks \u2014 for a few seconds so that some transaction can be carried out and the loan repaid. It is a new and exciting concept and has no traditional finance counterpart or analogy.\nIt exists due to the properties of blockchains themselves, which enables zero default risk, making collateral or credit checks irrelevant. Implemented via a smart contract, the borrower must pay back the loan in the same transaction. All parts of the programmed flash loan contract must be executed, or none of them are. If the funds are not repaid, then the loan is not made. The transaction is cancelled in its entirety, like the loan was never made.\nTo net it out, flash loans enable tokens to be borrowed, transactions undertaken, and the loan repaid, all as part of a single smart contract on a blockchain. Invented fairly recently (by Marble Protocol in 2018), the flash loan product has spread rapidly to a number of Ethereum-based DeFi lending platforms including dYDdX and Aave, and is used to fund and execute arbitrage trades.\nIn the attack on CREAM Finance, $1.5 billion in flash loans and market price manipulation combined to powerful effect.\nUsing $1.5B billion in DAI borrowed in flash loans from Maker, the arbitrageurs were able to manipulate the price of the crYUSD token on CREAM. They were able to artificially double the price of the crYUSD token from its \u201creal\u201d value of $1 to $2.\nIt sounds relatively straightforward, but the CREAM attack was complex to execute. It involved multiple Ethereum wallets and it was executed via dozens of discrete steps. This thread on Twitter by Mudit Gupta breaks down the attack by each step, along with his blog post detailing 29 steps, here.\nMy takeaway\nBut was a crime committed by the attacker or attackers, who set up the programmatic trading bot which took off with $130m in profit? Was this event an act of theft? Some reports stated the $130m was \u2018stolen\u2019 from CREAM Finance\u2019s liquidity pools.\nHowever, in my opinion, the Defi Attack on CREAM Finance did not reach the status of a crime. Instead, this was an event where the weaknesses in a system were exploited. The fact that prices can be exploited and that a slippage in prices can be induced intentionally, is not the attacker\u2019s fault.\nIn financial markets arbitragers are always operating, undertaking trades to exploit price discrepancies between assets and, in doing so, providing significant benefits to the markets. Cryptocurrency is a new market, and a new place in which to exercise arbitrage opportunities.\nWhat can crypto exchanges do about flash loan attacks?\nOne way to dampen the impact of a flash loan attack is for an exchange to make the prices it hosts less susceptible to manipulation, so that significant price differences don\u2019t emerge in the first place for bad actors to exploit.\nA way to do this is to refer to third party prices, known as Oracles. These draw prices from multiple sources and are less vulnerable to being manipulated. An Oracle helps keep the price stay in line with the value of a token. Elsewhere, exchanges can also run simulations to determine if there is a problem that\u2019s ripe for exploitation and then block trades that look dodgy.\nHow can you reduce the risk of falling victim to a flash loan attack?\nBasically, you should pay attention to news and rumors. Keep track of the news regarding exchanges that you use and assets which you trade. One investor who seems to have taken action in the wake of the CREAM attack, is investor and TRON-founder Justin Sun. At the end of October, Sun withdrew around $6.8bn in USD, BTC and other crypto from Aave, a DeFi protocol like CREAM, motivated by fears the platform could potentially have a similar point of failure to CREAM.\nLEARN MORE\nTo go deeper and find out more about what\u2019s covered in this post, I suggest checking these sources.\nHow to Make a Flash Loan using Aave explained \u2014 step-by-step beginners guides | QuickNode\nWhat Are Flash Loan Attacks? | Alexandria\nThe DeFi \u2018Flash Loan\u2019 Attack That Changed Everything \u2014 Huseeb Qureshi, CoinDesk Insights\nCreamed Cream \u2014 Learn the Secret Recipe (Cream Hack Analysis) \u2014 Mudit Gupta\u2019s Blog\nJustin Sun withdraws billions of dollars worth of crypto from Aave\u2019s lending pools (theblockcrypto.com)\nExchanges can also run simulations to determine if there is a problem that\u2019s ripe for exploitation (link).\nHow a cunning trick made it look like a CryptoPunk sold for $532 million (theblockcrypto.com)\nDeciphering a Transaction on Etherscan \u2014 EthHub", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 0, "created_time": 1635368539747, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Cryptocurrency", "Defi", "Finance And Banking", "Entrepreneurship"]}, {"author": "Sunny Labh", "post_id": "9799967dd482", "user_id": "cace67d704a3", "title": "3 Books You Must Read As a Physics Enthusiast", "content": "3 Books You Must Read As a Physics Enthusiast\nBooks that will help you understand physics better\nA lot of people ask me about my reading list.

We have arrived very far from the mechanical world of Newton, where minute, cold stones eternally wandered on long, precise trajectories in geometrically immutable space. Quantum mechanics and experiments with particles have taught us that the world is a continuous, restless swarming of things, a continuous coming to light and disappearance of ephemeral entities.\u201d\nSeven Brief Lessons on Physics. Image Source\nCarlo Rovelli is one of the most prolific theoretical physicists and science writers today. His book Seven Brief Lessons on Physics was first published in 2014. The book has been a treat for anyone interested in physics. He explains various important blocks of modern physics like quantum mechanics, the mysteries of space and time, laws of thermodynamics, and many more. He poetically described the role of human minds in wondering and experimenting and understanding the world and the universe. Rovelli himself is an iconic modern thinker, and I\u2019ve always been fascinated by his works in loop quantum gravity.\nI highly recommend this book for anyone who is fascinated by the wonders of the universe and wants to understand how it functions all the way from the quantum world to the large-scale structures of the universe.\nThe book is elegant and simple for anyone to understand for Prof. Rovelli has done a fine job is crafting the explanations on several deep concepts in physics. He also describes certain philosophical ideas in the book. Ideas like human consciousness have also been explored so beautifully. Must read.\nSix Easy Pieces by Richard Feynman\n\u201cI think, however, that there isn\u2019t any solution to this problem of education other than to realize that the best teaching can be done only when there is a direct individual relationship between a student and a good teacher \u2014 \u2014 a situation in which the student discusses the ideas, thinks about the things, and talks about the things.\u201d\nSix Easy Pieces. Image by BECKY JEWELL\nI\u2019d read this book as a first-year undergrad student. I don\u2019t think I need to explain anything about Professor Feynman and his writings. I mean I have dedicated an entire Twitter account on his behalf. The book Six Easy Pieces by Richard Feynman, Matthew Sands, and Ralph Leighton is another masterpiece that I recommend to everyone. The 176 pages long book explains everything from atomic physics to the theory of gravitation.\nThe book has been extracted from Feynman\u2019s lectures at Caltech that he delivered during 1961\u20131963. It doesn\u2019t incorporate all the lectured though. Feynman charismatically presents the most important ideas in physics with such clarity, and brilliance and it keeps anyone hooked. His expressive character and perfect way of explaining complicated concepts are very much evident from this masterpiece. I wish Feynman were alive today. I\u2019m always curious to know his perspective about modern-day topics.\nThe Theoretical Minimum by Leonard Susskind\n\u201cIf a system is chaotic (most are), then it implies that however good the resolving power may be, the time over which the system is predictable is limited. Perfect predictability is not achievable, simply because we are limited in our resolving power.\u201d\nThe theoretical minimum by Leonard Susskind. Image by Mete Atature\nLeonard Susskind is famously known as the \u2018bad boy of physics.\u2019 The Theoretical Minimum is a series of books written by physicist Leonard Susskind and co-authored by Art Friedman and George Hrabovsky. The series primarily consists of three main courses: Quantum Mechanics, Classical Mechanics and, Special Relativity and Classical Field Theory.\nFor any physics enthusiast, these courses are absolute gems. They come in handy and comprise a wide range of physics topics that are so elegantly explained by the Stanford physicist. He has covered the most fundamental topics in theoretical physics and backed them up amazingly with mathematics. In order for you to understand the course contents, you need to have some basic knowledge of physics and the fundamentals of mathematics. Nonetheless, I highly recommend these books for anyone who is starting his/her academic career in physics or is already pursuing physics.\nAlong with the books, I highly suggest y\u2019all watch his Stanford Lectures which are freely available on YouTube.\nThank you so much for reading.

Most persons are so absorbed in the contemplation of the outside world that they are wholly oblivious to what is passing on within themselves. The premature death of millions is primarily traceable to this cause. Even among those who exercise care, it is a common mistake to avoid imaginary, and ignore the real dangers. And what is true of an individual also applies, more or less, to a people as a whole.\u201d\n\u2014 Nikola Tesla, Extraordinary Experiences ch. 2, My Inventions, published in 1919.\nMost of the wireless technologies that we use today are because of his ideas and his research. In one of his publications, Tesla has mentioned how he solved such complicated engineering problems with the help of visualizations. He said, that the secret of his ideas and inventions lies in his unique method of visualization. He would imagine his designs and patents in his mind and would experiment with them, pretty much like how Einstein used to do thought experiments. But the difference between Tesla\u2019s thought experiments and Einstein\u2019s was that Einstein would imagine hypothetical situations and would try to make them consistent with his theories and mathematics. Tesla, on the other hand, would have thought experiments on his designs and inventions and would experiment with them, often checking their flaws and failures and he would do all this by taking himself to sort of a hypnotized state of mind.\nTesla holding a phosphor lamp. Image source.\nSome articles about him also mention that Tesla believed in the existence of aliens. He would often try to communicate with the life forms existing in distant galaxies. Nikola Tesla was confident that he could communicate with extraterrestrial life forms. He has mentioned about such extraordinary set of skills of him in a letter that he wrote in December 1909 to the American Red Cross.\nImage source: Tesla Society\nIn this letter, he has clearly stated that he communicated with beings on mars. Nikola Tesla was a genius. He was an engineering polymath. Another mysterious fact about Nikola Tesla was that he and most of his works were closely associated with the number \u201c3\u201d. This is quite fascinating to comprehend because \u201c3\u201d is some kind of a symbol. Whenever anyone claims to communicate with any sort of powerful or mysterious entity, they often do so in the forms of symbols and signs. The information is exchanged in the form of some mysterious codes and Tesla was no new to this phenomenon. But the question remains the same: why was \u20183\u2019 such an important number for the outstanding genius?\nThroughout his life, Tesla always dreamed of inventing wireless electricity. He had significant contributions to wireless communication systems. But he wanted to make it more efficient and cost-effective. What if he has already invented such technology and he used it for communicating with otherworldly beings?\nSrinivasa Ramanujan shouldn\u2019t be a new name for you if you are reading this article. Ramanujan is one of the most brilliant mathematicians in human history who had extraordinary abilities to formulate complicated mathematical theorems and formulas which otherwise were incomprehensible to other mathematicians of the time. The great mathematical prodigy once stated that,\n\u201cWhile asleep, I had an unusual experience. There was a red screen formed by flowing blood, as it were. I was observing it. Suddenly a hand began to write on the screen. I became all attention. That hand wrote a number of elliptic integrals. They stuck to my mind. As soon as I woke up, I committed them to writing.\u201d\nIn several scholarly publications, it is mentioned that Ramanujan had a unique ability to communicate with some higher beings who would guide him to the ultimate truths of the mathematical universe. Ramanujan used to believe that someone from another world would come to his dreams and guide him. The entity or power that he believed guided him was a Hindu god named Namagiri. Namagiri was the main god \u2018Kul devata\u2019 for him and his family. Before beginning any research and digging himself into the realm of mathematics he would always take the blessings of his god. \nSurprisingly, before every single mathematical discovery of Srinivasa Ramanujan, he would go to sleep in a hope that his god would come and guide him through the process. He believed that this divineness was the key to all his discoveries. Once he would be in deep sleep, all those complicated mathematical formulations would appear and he would receive much important mathematical information from there.\nSrinivasa Ramanujan\nRamanujan once distinctly mentioned in one of his writings, that once in his dream he saw a red wall where a hand suddenly appeared and started writing mathematical equations one after another. Ramanujan memorized all those equations and when he woke up he checked the validity of all of them. He mentioned that all those equations were extremely important, true, and way ahead of their time. Many of Ramanujan\u2019s works were ahead of their time and quite new for anyone to understand. To this day, a lot of his works haven\u2019t been decoded and proved. Did Ramanujan have an extraordinary divine ability to talk to otherworldly beings? Could he communicate with God?\nThis is something that I find quite amusing about both these prolific personalities. These brains have inspired generations of inventors and thinkers and their works and their minds have never had any substitutes. How did they get their ideas and what exactly were their secrets of knowledge is something to ponder upon. Irrespective of their ideologies and beliefs, their works have made remarkable impacts upon modern human civilization and will do so for coming thousands of years.\nThank you so much for reading.

It is the force that binds planets, galaxies, and star clusters together. It is the force that dominates the existence of a black hole and makes it one of the most powerful objects in space. Before Einstein, the only consistent explanation of how gravity works were provided by Sir Isaac Newton in his book the Principia published in 1687. Newton explained that gravity is an attractive force responsible for keeping planets in orbit. His views were very widely accepted, and his math worked pretty well. However, Newton couldn\u2019t explain the origin of gravity. He left that idea to the God.\nEinsteinian View of Gravity\nOn 25 November 1915, 36 years old Albert Einstein presented a set of papers to the Prussian Academy. The papers were about his idea of gravitation that contained a set of mathematical equations that gave details about curved space-time. According to Einstein, space and time are not completely different entities but are dimensions of the same continuum of the universe. To put it simply, the Einsteinian view of gravity described gravity not as an attractive force that binds planets and stars together, but as a result of matter interacting with space.\nHe explained that space is not static. It is bendable, twistable, and, distortable. The force of gravity, according to Einstein, is nothing but an entity created by the interaction of matter with geometrical space. He called it the general theory of relativity. Physicist John Archibald Wheeler did a fine job explaining the general relativity theory in one single line,\nSpace-time tells matter how to move; matter tells space-time how to curve.\nThe set of equations that Einstein formulated in his papers predicted some of the most amazing results including the perihelion shift of planet Mercury, the bending of light coming from the stars, and even the formation of black holes and neutron stars. Einstein was quite a well-known figure in the scientific community due to his brilliant findings that came to the light from his 1905 papers on special relativity but he wasn\u2019t widely popular amongst the general masses.\nPhoto by Maks Key on Unsplash\nEinstein did a fine job setting up the mathematical foundations of his mind-bending theory of gravity but there were no experimental pieces of evidence to prove his idea to be true. And until and unless a theory cannot be proven experimentally, that cannot be accepted to be true. That\u2019s how the scientific method works.\nArthur Eddington and the 1919 Solar eclipse\nSoon after, the papers of Albert Einstein about the theory of gravitation fell into the hands of a British astronomer and physicist Arthur Eddington. Eddington studied Einstein\u2019s papers and instantly predicted that this could be another revolutionary stance in physics after Newton. He translated Einstein\u2019s papers, which were written in German, to English. Eddington focused upon one of the predictions of Einstein\u2019s equations about the bending of starlight. It was always supposed that light always travels in a straight line through space. But Einstein\u2019s theory was correct, the light would bend due to the bending curvature of space-time.\nEddington and his team including Frank Dyson thought of experimenting with these predictions of Einstein and in May 1919 he set up two expeditions to photograph the solar eclipse. The idea was to capture the fully covered sun and see if the apparent positions of the surrounding stars change. The experiment required heavy sophisticated telescopes and photographic cameras.\nEddington\u2019s photographic image of the total solar eclipse from 29 May, 1919. Image credit: Frank Dyson and Royal Astronomical Society. First published in \u201cPhilosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A\u201d\nAfter several failed attempts, Eddington got a good charm for a moment after a dark and cloudy sky during the eclipse on 29 May and observed a clear sky with evaporating clouds making the stars appear more clear and distinct through the telescope. He took several pictures on the photographic plates and found a displacement of 1.61 + or \u2014 0.3 seconds of arc. The results of the experiment weren\u2019t exactly what Einstein had predicted in his papers but was close enough to validate his theory over Newton\u2019s. Eddington referred to that moment as\n\u201cthe greatest moment of his life.\u201d\nEinstein\u2019s coverage in international media\nIn September of the same year, Einstein received a letter from his friend Hendrik Lorentz, that the British expedition team and Eddington had found the deflection in the starlight and the change in positions of the stars hence proving his theory of general relativity.\nIn November 1919, a meeting was held between the Royal Society and Royal Astronomical Society where the results of the expedition were announced. Joseph John Thomson, theoretical physicist, and Nobel Laureate, who was the president of the Royal Society at the time said,\n\u201cThis [Einstein\u2019s work] is the greatest achievement in the history of human thought.\u201d\nSoon enough, the news was spread all over the world. London Times was the first to cover the story with the title \u2018The Fabric of the Universe\u2019, the International New York Times covered the same story with a three-column article titled \u2018Eclipse showed gravity variation: Hailed as Epoch Making\u201d. Many other national and international media companies shared Einstein\u2019s works and the experimental results making the physicist an overnight celebrity.\nAfter the official announcements of the results, Einstein\u2019s house was crowded with media personalities from all over the world who wanted to interview him and capture his photos.\nArthur Eddington (Right) and Albert Einstein (Left) at the garden of the Observatory, Cambridge, June 1930.

Her song \u201cTruth Hurts\u201d references a meme which references a tweet, which references how popular genetic ancestry tests are in the USA. I feel it. All of it. DNA tests are having a moment. So is Lizzo and her message of self-love. Maybe these two moments are related.\nRecently, I read a great essay by Araci Almeida questioning why Americans are so concerned with our ancestry, and why we love asking other people about theirs. I felt seen.\nAssuming her anecdotal observation holds true, what would make Americans so into our ancestry? Why? What drives our curiosity?\nI can\u2019t speak for all Americans, but I can start with myself. It might come down to me wanting to belong. When my peers were asking me \u201cwhat are you?\u201d in grade school, I wanted to have the right answer. I wanted an answer that helped me fit in. I knew that Germans and Irish in Wisconsin are not controversial, so I hoped I had a safe story. I also knew we were Welsh and maybe Native American (recent DNA test says 0.0%, so maybe not after all), both of which were safely \u201ccool\u201d with my peers.\nI think we all want an acceptable answer to the common schoolyard question \u201cwhat are you?\u201d\nBelonging is important. For me it was doubly important because my family moved to a small town when I was six. Many of these kids\u2019 families knew each other going back generations. I wanted bona fides to be able to say \u201cI\u2019m like you.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you?\u201d was just one of many ways we kids interrogated each other, especially new kids. When a new kid would enter our school, we had to find out who he or she was. Where do you go to church? Where do you live? What sports do you play? Why is your name weird? What\u2019s that in your lunch? Are you wearing the same clothes as yesterday? And: what are you?\nAny wrong answer could mean pariah status on the playground. However, any kid could redeem themselves by standing out. If a kid was funny, or rich, or smart, or good at sports, then that might help them still be accepted.\nBelonging was so important for me because I felt like I was outside of the norm. I was a new kid. I was a sensitive kid. My dad did not hunt with the other dads. I was shy. I wanted people to like me and accept me. Mostly, they did. Looking back, I was much closer to the norm than I imagined myself to be, but I couldn\u2019t see it.\nI think our collective obsession with DNA tests that reveal what percent of what we are is part of a longer story that was going on well before DNA genealogy tests became popular. Starting at least with the publication of Alex Haley\u2019s Roots, and probably before that, Americans have been itching to find out who and what we are.\nIf I had to guess why other people in the United States might be interested in genealogy, I might say that we, collectively, are the \u201cnew kid.\u201d The USA is a conglomeration of groups of people from all over the world. Perhaps Americans are interested in genealogy because it helps us locate ourselves within an uncertain world. Genealogy can give a person a connection to history in America and reassure us that we belong. Even if our story doesn\u2019t fit with the standard American narrative, genealogy can still give us a sub-group where we do fit in.\nThis quest to belong can seem innocent on a schoolyard where most of the kids actually do belong, either by adhering to the dominant culture or by finding a sub-group where they are seen and valued. But not every kid reaches belonging. Many are perpetual outsiders. Many are actively excluded.\nIn America, the consequences of exclusion and outsidership are writ large on society. The dominant culture asks \u201cwhat are you?\u201d to whole groups of people.\nOne of the worst things a white person can say to a person of Asian descent or a multi-ethnic person with dark skin is to ask them \u201cWhat are you?\u201d or \u201cWhere are you really from?\u201d Both of those questions, that to white kids on a playground are just means to sort each other out, can have the racist impact of exclusion from the category \u201creal American.\u201d\nIf it is true that Americans are more interested in ancestry than Europeans, why is that?\nA bemused observer might suggest that we are trying to find belonging because we are a relatively new and evolving country. For Europeans, an old building might be 800 to a 1000 years old. For us (unless you are Native), anything over 100 would qualify.\nWhen a kid doesn\u2019t know if they belong on the playground, they might try to do things to prove they belong. Sometimes that will include picking on someone who has even less claim to belonging than they do. Most bullies are insecure about themselves.\nSome say that the American focus on patriotism is partly because the nation had to be invented out of thin air. Many point to the architecture in Washington DC, with its deliberate call backs to Roman and Greek ruins, as an attempt to show that our nation belongs. We act like we have something to prove \u2014 a chip on our shoulder. We make myths about our Founding Fathers, and hold onto them to help us feel like we are good people.\nMaybe white midwestern Americans, like me, like to get five or six generations back on a family tree because it helps us feel connected to \u201cgood\u201d history. We imagine hard-working immigrants pioneering in the west and men coming home from the Revolution or Civil War to begin making America into an industrial powerhouse.\nThis use of genealogy helps us feel like we belong, and that is good. But, and this is a big but, it can be harmful to people whose ancestry doesn\u2019t fit the white mold.\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be harmful.\nOne of the great lessons I have learned as an adult working with teenagers is that hardly anybody feels like they truly belong. We all question whether we fit in, to some degree, and this sensitivity is especially true for adolescents.\nOn the schoolyard, when a kid doesn\u2019t feel like they belong, it can go either way. Either they become disaffected and prone to isolation or bullying, or something can happen in the community to draw them in. It could be one friend or an aware adult who pulls them in. It could be someone noticing that the person on the edge has something valuable to offer. Usually when someone welcomes someone else into the community, it is because they see something in common with the outsider. This is an ongoing process and it is how we create and maintain community.\nI think genealogy itself can be inclusive. It can help us see what we have in common with other people. An inclusive genealogy can be an effort to fight against the myth-making of exceptionalism.\nWe actually don\u2019t want the myth. In my experience, Americans I know are fascinated with finding out the true stories of our ancestors because it holds a mirror up to us and allows us to see events and people as they were and are. We CAN handle the truth.\nThis might actually be why Americans love genealogy. Because at heart we want to believe that the freedom and justice promised in our founding documents is for everybody, including us. We want to dig deeper than the mythological narratives of pilgrims and pioneers, and see ourselves and others in there.\nI think that the point of focusing on my identity is to actually get to a point of seeing the common humanity in all Americans. My goal in my genealogy practice is solidarity, not exclusivity. The same could be said for the people who responded to \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d by saying \u201cAll Lives Matter.\u201d Yes. Of course All Lives Matter, but that misses the point. We need to bring Black lives up to the point where they matter as much as white lives.\nI hate to mix metaphors, but here goes: The true stories of our ancestors unravel a sort of cloth that was woven in the initial framing of the founding myths of America. The true story of the United States is constantly evolving. It is like a schoolyard with a constant influx of new kids. In addition to the new kids, there are also many stories that did not get woven into the initial cloth. It is well worth unraveling the cloth and reweaving it, and to me this is the greatness of our nation. We constantly reinvent ourselves.\nLizzo tells us that the \u201cTruth Hurts,\u201d but her message is all about self-love and feeling like she is worth it. That is a truth that I can get behind.\nA word about language. Here in the United States, we refer to ourselves as \u201cAmericans,\u201d and I follow that convention in this essay when I speak about how we think about ourselves. Technically we should call ourselves United Statesians or something else, because \u201cAmerican\u201d refers to anyone from the western hemisphere. It is a marker of our collective myth-making that we have appropriated that word to mean anyone from the USA.\nMore reading:\nIs My Genealogy Hobby Racist?\nWhat I learned as a potential Son of the American Revolution.medium.com", "comment_count": 21, "like_count": 632, "created_time": 1645992042252, "comment": [{"user_id": "12223ba38f45", "comment_time": 1645992042252, "comment": "Thank you for sharing!"}, {"user_id": "847a3d70c337", "comment_time": 1646679256474, "comment": "Many never talk to their parents, aunts, uncles, grand parents or great-grand parents about their family timelines.

The sale price didn\u2019t have anything to do with the price of the corn one can grow on that land. Instead, it was part of a trend we are seeing of farmland being bought as investment property. Rich people, including Bill Gates as well as various investment firms like Acretrader (whose ads I see on my Facebook feed and who I generously refer to as \u201cthose f**king f**ks\u201d), see farmland as the next big investment opportunity for their portfolios. This influx of money, much of it from outside the USA, has been driving up farmland prices above what farmers can afford to pay.\nI can see a time in the near future when most farmland will be owned by investors, who then will rent to the people who actually farm. These owners will live off the rents, as the value of their \u201cestates\u201d rise, sort of like the lords of old England.\nThis same process has happened in many housing markets in the USA, where investors and groups of investors are gobbling up properties and pricing regular folks who need a house to live in out of the housing market. In turn, this all drives up rents for housing, squeezing people who are not owners.\nOne of my favorite medium writers, John Egelkrout, wrote a piece that gave a name for what I was seeing: \u201cneo-feudalism.\u201d Here is his piece:\nNeo-feudalism: The Only Way Forward in America\nAll that\u2019s missing is the knight in shining armormedium.com\nI decided to play with the concept, using the form of a near-future short fiction story. I hope you like it.\nAs the freight train slowly leaves the yard and starts to gain speed, I throw my pack over my shoulder and start running. My eye is on the open door of an empty car. My timing is good this time and soon I\u2019m standing in the car, my hand on the door frame, huffing and puffing while I look out at the houses and fields and listen as the click-clack sound of the wheels intensifies as the train gains speed.\nAt the age of 62, I never thought I would be jumping freight trains and begging for work in random places.\n\u201cHow far ya heading mister?\u201d\nI turn my head to see a ragged-looking kid sitting in the corner of the car. The kid\u2019s clothes are layers of torn denim and flannel and they have a faded Green Bay Packers stocking cap on. Their feet are bare and crusty with dirt.\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking of stopping in LaCrosse. I hear there might be independent operators hiring on the grain barges.\u201d I hear myself say. I usually don\u2019t like to share my business with strangers, but this kid hasn\u2019t set off any internal alarms.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your name mister?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m Tony. You?\u201d I give them my real name.\n\u201cKit.\u201d\n\u201cHi Kit.\u201d\n\u201cYou got any food?\u201d\nI reach into my bag and throw Kit a hunk of dry bread. They devour it.\nKit and I ride in silence. They are in the corner, watching me warily, and I\u2019m in the doorway watching the world go by. I have learned not to get too friendly at first. Often a lone traveler is alone for a reason. But Kit seems harmless. Couldn\u2019t be more than 12 or 13. Same age as the kids I used to teach. With all the grime, and hiding under the hat and the flannel, I couldn\u2019t say if Kit is a girl or a boy. Doesn\u2019t matter, I suppose. They are another traveler, and I am glad for the company.\n\u201cHey, mister Tony. You\u2019re old. What was it like?\u201d\n\u201cOh, you mean before the king took over?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, that.\u201d\nI think back to ten years ago. I had a job, a house, a car, and a marriage. That is all a distant memory.\n\u201cI suppose it was different for different people. For me, I had comfort and security. I had plenty of food and never had to worry about where I was going to sleep. I had to work, but my job was steady and I had free time to watch tv or look at the internet. I had enough money to buy whatever I needed. My house had heat in the winter. We didn\u2019t have to address the owners as lord this or lady that. We could vote for our leaders.\u201d\nKit looked at me for a while. \u201cWhat\u2019s a tv?\u201d\nI take a second look at Kit. Here is a skinny white kid trying to tell me they don\u2019t know what a tv is. Where did they come from?\n\u201cWhat are you running from Kit?\u201d I say.\n\u201cNothing\u2026 Everything. You wouldn\u2019t get it.\u201d\n\u201cTry me.\u201d\n\u201cMister Tony. You see I have been living my whole life on a turkey farm north of here. They treat me worse than the turkeys. Yesterday I jumped on this train when they were loading birds. It wasn\u2019t like I decided to get on the train. Nobody was watching me and I just did it. I ain\u2019t never been off the farm. When you jumped on the car, I was trying to decide to jump off or get ready to fight ya.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t try to fight me, Kit!\u201d And that is the truth. I\u2019ve been in scrapes before, but I don\u2019t like fighting kids. It makes me hold back, and that makes me vulnerable.\nThe train lurches to a stop. I look out and I see in the distance the tangle of blue tarps and random structures that signifies an outlaw camp. There are about a dozen people walking toward the train, perhaps 200 yards off. They are carrying what look like guns and clubs, and they are walking with purpose.\n\u201cWhy\u2019d we stop, mister Tony?\u201d asks Kit.\n\u201cBe quiet\u201d I hiss, as I hide behind the wall of the freight car. \u201cOutlaws are coming.\u201d\nKit comes running up to see. I let them look, but then push them aside. I know too much about outlaws. They live on the margins, unattached to any lord. They group together for protection, and sometimes, crime. This bunch likely blocked the tracks to stop the train and are coming over to see what they can get.\nI\u2019m thinking about what the outlaws might do to Kit and me. The options are going through my head. Fight, flight, freeze. There is no sneaking out the back. The other side door of the freight car is locked shut. If I jumped and ran out the front now, I\u2019d call attention to myself, and I\u2019m not ready to fight an armed gang. So I freeze, hiding further inside the car, hoping they won\u2019t see us as a threat if they do look inside our car.\nPow. Pow. I hear gunshots and look to see clouds of dust kicked up in front of the outlaws, who have stopped walking. The train must be protected by agents. I\u2019m wondering how desperate the outlaws are. Would they risk it? There is not much of value here. This train is mostly turkeys, grain cars, and empty freight like our car. Times are hard though. The king has been sending out patrols to hunt outlaws recently. He has been rounding them up and delivering them to the lords for labor or conscripting them into the army for the war in China. The more they are hunted, the more dangerous the outlaws are.\nI see the outlaws move to a position behind a low ditch, about 200 feet from the train. I don\u2019t think they have seen Kit and me, because they are looking at the front of the train. I can\u2019t see what is happening where they are looking, but after a little bit of silence, I hear at least a dozen guns go all at once. The outlaws are firing at the front of the train, where I am guessing the train crew has been trying to move whatever is blocking the train. And there are an equal number of shots coming from the train from the agents. I hear shouts and cries of pain and calls for help. I\u2019m wondering if I should run now, while they are all distracted.\n\u201cMister Tony, I\u2019m scared.\u201d\n\u201cMe too, Kit. Me too. Stay quiet and don\u2019t move.\u201d\nI decide I can\u2019t run alone. It would leave Kit alone and in danger. And I can\u2019t run with Kit because they might get caught in the crossfire.\nThe shooting stops abruptly.\nI hear the creak of the train wheels as they start to move. I breathe a sigh of relief. The crew must have cleared whatever was blocking the train.\n\u201cWho are those bad people, mister Tony?\u201d\n\u201cKit, those folks aren\u2019t bad. They\u2019re just outlaws. Hungry ones, most likely.\nThose people were probably hoping to eat turkey tonight. Outlaws were not always so desperate, nor were they always outlaws. I remember when the king first came to power. I lost my job when he closed the schools. With my job, went my home, and my marriage. I was in a rough spot. I walked away from everything and found myself in one of the camps on the edge of the city. During those days, the lords were not called lords and the king was not the king. They were just the owners, and he was the \u2018president.\u2019\u201d\nAs the train gained speed we passed the area where the blockade had been. There was a pile of timbers and twisted metal that had been pushed to the side. Next to the pile was what looked like the body of a crew member, obviously dead.\n\u201cThey killed him, mister Tony. They killed him for doing his job. Those outlaws are bad people.\u201d\n\u201cIf they are bad, Kit, they didn\u2019t start out that way. I remember in my camp, the owners would send buses to the camps every day to look for workers. It wasn\u2019t that bad. When I worked, the owners would feed me lunch and put some money on my phone, which I could use at their stores to buy food, clothes, medicine, or fuel that I could bring back to the camp. The camps were rough, but people looked out for each other.\nAs a teacher and a farmer, the people in my camp soon came to value my skills. I helped set up gardens, composting, and rainwater collection. We ran a sort of school for the children, although they had to educate themselves much of the time. The children learned to care for the chickens and tend the gardens, since the adults had to work for the owners when we could. Even with the struggle, I remember those days as good times.\u201d\n\u201cIf it was so good, why did you leave, mister Tony? Maybe you could take me there?\u201d\n\u201cEven if I wanted to take you there, we could never go back to that camp.\nSomething changed when the owners started calling themselves lords. You probably only ever knew your owner as \u201clord.\u201d There was a day when it switched. The owners created a system where each one claimed control of land, businesses, and housing, all within a given territory. With the help of the military and the police, the lords claimed ownership of every private home and business in their territory and then invited people to stay in their homes and work for them. Most people stayed. There wasn\u2019t anywhere else for them to go. Within the lords\u2019 domains, people did not have to worry about food, shelter, medicine, or other basic needs, as long as they worked for their lord.\nAfter this, people from my camp started leaving to live under the protection and generosity of a lord, and the day-work buses slowly stopped coming to the camps.\nMy camp dissolved one day when most of the families simply walked to the city and submitted to a lord. I was left with about a dozen other holdouts. Most of us were single men or women, along with a few who couldn\u2019t work for one reason or another.\nA few days after the families left, a lord came with bulldozers to level what was left of our camp. I suppose that was the day we became outlaws. I left on my own, and I have been traveling ever since. I try to stay in the rural areas, where there are still a few independent farms. I\u2019m able to contribute as a farmhand and I can teach farm kids to read, write, and figure, if I\u2019m asked.\nI move on any time I\u2019ve stayed in one place too long. In the rural areas, more and more land is coming under the control of the lords, and having a hired man attracts unwanted attention to an independent farmer.\u201d\nKit falls silent for a while. I\u2019m guessing some of this is new information to them. They probably spent their whole life on some lord\u2019s turkey farm. The rural lords don\u2019t like their workers to learn to read or write and certainly never to learn history. It is amazing how quickly people accept complicity with their lords in exchange for security. When the other option is becoming an outcast, people choose to keep their food and protection and keep their mouths shut. Those rural fiefdoms are mostly self-sufficient and safe from violence. Something must have been pretty bad for Kit to run away.\nI am taken with the idea of using this train ride to educate Kit. I want them to know about how it all happened. I want them to know that some of us saw the king coming and tried to stop him. Some of us are still working from outside the system to try to bring it down.\n\u2018Kit, I\u2019m going to tell you a story.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, mister Tony.\u201d\n\u201cThe king was president before he was king, and before he was president, he was just a rich owner who wanted to be president.\nBefore he came to power, prices had been going way up for farmland, healthcare, food, fuel, and housing. Every year, records were broken for the prices of houses and farmland. This was when the owners were buying everything up as investments. The more they invested, the higher the prices, which made them want to invest more. The banks kept loaning them money to buy more and more. The owners drove up the prices so high that regular people could no longer afford to buy a house to live in or buy land to farm on.\nPrices were going up on everything else, too. Any regular person who had to work for a living soon could not afford basic needs and we all went into debt. If they owned any property, many people were forced to sell it in order to pay their debts. The owners were only too happy to buy people\u2019s land or houses and then rent them back to them.\nOne day, an owner came along and promised that if we made him president, he would fix inflation and provide jobs for everyone who wanted to work. Many people believed him. The people saw a man who had succeeded in a system where so many of us had failed, and they figured that he must have some sort of secret knowledge. He could be the savior. They voted for him.\nNot me. I saw him for what he was. He was a man who could never get enough power.\nHe quickly took over the banks and eliminated debts for all people. A \u201cclean slate\u201d he called it. Everyone cheered. But what became clear was that the big owners were the ones who benefited most from this move, and the president and his family were the biggest owners of them all. This was a chance for the rich to get richer, and the rest of us suffered the consequences, as prices continued to rise and most of us fell right back into debt.\nBut after a short while, things were not looking good for the president. People were not happy with him and his family because he didn\u2019t stop inflation. People became especially mad when his family took possession of federal lands and resources. His poll numbers were down, and it looked like he might lose the next election.\nThen it all changed again from one day to the next. The president went on tv and said that China had launched a cyber attack on his businesses. He said an attack on him was an attack on us, and he ordered the military to retaliate. Soon we were at war in China. The president declared martial law and in that same week, he closed the schools and universities and news channels for teaching anti-American propaganda. That was when I had to go live in the camp.\nThe war dragged on and was unpopular, and inflation went up again. The president claimed he had a plan to finally ensure everyone\u2019s food and security. That was when he declared himself \u201cking\u201d and named the biggest owners in each region as \u201clords.\u201d Each lord owed their power to the king, so they supported him. The king said he trusted the lords to provide for their people, and that under this system everyone would be cared for. That was when the king started to call us all \u2018his children.\u2019\u201d\nKit looks at me for a long time. They have no memory of life before our father the king. This is a fanciful story to them. At last, they speak: \u201cWhen we get to LaCrosse, can you help me get a job on a barge with you?\u201d\n\u201cSure, Kit.

This was one of the first stories that I wrote specifically for Medium (most of the others prior to that one were imported from my Facebook page). In reviewing it today I noticed that the original version had really long paragraphs, and that might be why it didn\u2019t get any attention. Also, since I did not have any followers at the time, maybe the timing was bad.\nSelf-Acceptance versus Cancel Culture. \u2014 2 fans. This 16-minute essay was part of a three-part series on cancel culture. My guess is it is too long and the title is not sticky enough. Plus my photo is of a heart-shaped potato. Also, this one suffered from me only having a few followers at the time.\nA Few Good Men, Crying. \u2014 0 fans. Thirteen minutes of me talking about my feelings during a men\u2019s workshop I went to. I think it is interesting, but perhaps Medium is not the right audience.\nCan Relocalizing Agriculture Slow Climate Change? \u2014 4 fans. I thought a lot about this piece, but it only has seven reads. Perhaps 16-minutes is too much?\nThe Worst Best Year of My Life \u2014 4 fans. I wrote this for the Writers Challenge, and I had lots of feelings while writing it. I needed to write it. Sometimes I need to write stories just for me and accept that maybe that is enough.\nI write a monthly column on genealogy for my local paper, and I publish versions of those stories here.

Here are five stories from that column:\nFamily Trees, Sex, and Challenging Patriarchy\nPeter Price the Pittsburgh Puddler\nWho Was Benjamin B Bruce?\nRemembering Uncle Buddy\nDeep Genealogy \u2014 I\u2019m an Above Average Neanderthal\nI have also written quite a bit about climate change, including a dystopian novel that I finished in 2019 and published here as a serial. Here are the top ten reasons to read it.\nMy longest story was: How I am Complicit in Indian Boarding School Abuse. At 34 minutes, perhaps it was 25\u201330 minutes too long for this website. I wanted to be thorough, but what was I thinking?\nMy shortest was Some Thoughts on Capitalism While Shoveling Manure. One minute of pure bliss. I think I should do more of those.\nThere are so many writers here who I hold in high esteem, and I think I become a better writer simply by reading your work. Thank you! Here are five writers I have appreciated recently.\nLeonora Watkins. She consistently reads and highlights my stories, and I appreciate her work. Here is one essay.\nJohn Egelkrout. Lives in Wisconsin and teaches and farms and has a beard. We have a lot in common! I like his sense of humor and bite.\nWalter Rhein. He is another \u2018Sconny, like me. I like his take on politics.\nKathy Parker. Her writing challenges patriarchy.\nAllison Gaines. I almost always read her stories. Here is one.\nIt has been a little over a year since I started writing on Medium. I started out wanting to write about what it means to be a white progressive man living in a rural area. I expanded to include my monthly column on genealogy and stories about climate change and my travels in Central America.\nYou can access my whole catalog here:\nAndrew Gaertner on Medium curated some lists\nStart exploring Politics As Usual, Men, Ancestry Writing as Revolution and moremedium.com\nMost of my essays are usually non-fiction opinion pieces, but recently I have written a couple of short science fiction stories. Tell me what you think.\nI joined the Partner Program in September of 2021, and although I have not gotten rich, I have made back my monthly fee and a little more. I like being in the MPP because it helps me take my writing more seriously.\nMy big question is whether I can (or should) sustain this pace. Honestly, I am getting a little discouraged. Partly I thought I would become a better writer, quicker, by simply writing a lot of stories and essays. I think in year two I might have to be more deliberate in developing my skills.\nI do enjoy thinking about each essay as I am writing it over the course of days or weeks.

On one of my trips, a neighbor, driving a pick-up truck with a big plastic tank full of sap in the bed, stops to talk about the sap collecting season. We commiserate about the unpredictability of sap flow and he asks with a friendly laugh if we are getting tired of carrying buckets. He has a tubing system, which saves time and labor in the collection.

Atwood is well known as a creator of dystopian worlds, most notably in her book The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, and Klein and Atwood speak about the eerie similarities between the present-day crises facing the world and the imagined dystopian future of Atwood\u2019s book, written in 1984.\nMargaret Atwood tells Ezra Klein that the United States currently lacks a single unifying story, and that nations without such a story are in danger of civil war.\nAtwood says that we used to have such a unifying story, and that story was loosely connected to the founding mythos of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. The idea was that the USA, despite not living up to its founding ideals, was in the collective pursuit of that founding spirit, and we were getting progressively more free and equal.\nTranscript: Ezra Klein Interviews Margaret Atwood\nEvery Tuesday and Friday, Ezra Klein invites you into a conversation about something that matters, like today's episode\u2026www.nytimes.com\nI remember that collective spirit from my childhood in the 1970s. Whether folks were Democrats or Republicans, most of the people I knew had faith that we were living in a good nation, with worthy ideals. We all celebrated the Bicentennial and we all loved a good 4th of July parade.\nKlein and Atwood agreed that the old story is no longer enough to unify us as a nation. First, that story was never a reality for many Americans, including many Indigenous Americans, Black Americans, Latinx Americans, and poor people in general, regardless of race. As a unifying story, it worked mainly for working and middle-class white people (like my family), and for others who were able to succeed in that world.\nOur original unifying story has been rejected by both the right and the left. The right has fallen under the spell of private enterprise and has come to be suspicious of any government at all. The right seems to seek to undo whatever collective programs we have had in place that expand equal access to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. We can elect anti-government people for only a limited time before they do damage to our systems. We are seeing this in Wisconsin, where the anti-government right has paralyzed many of our government functions.\nOn the left, white people are increasingly aware that the United States was never the beacon of hope and equality that it claimed to be (most BIPOC and poor folks already knew this), and even as folks on the left work to bring about political solutions to our collective problems, many more people on the left have given up on government, as corrupt and ineffective.\nAtwood contends that we need a new unifying story, and she is pessimistic about our chances of finding one that works for both the right and the left.\nThe interview was a sobering reminder that dystopias are currently popular in literature and film because they ring true to so many of our experiences of the present day. Practical utopias are significantly harder to imagine, but that is exactly what we need to do.\nWhat could be a new unifying story for America?\nMy answer is maple syrup.\nMaple sap in the evaporator (my photo)\nIn pre-European settler times, maple sugar season was an important time of the year for Ojibwe (Anishinaabe) communities and for other Native groups that harvested and cooked maple sap to make sugar. During the winters, the bands would disperse into family groups and have scattered winter camps. In the early spring, when the maple sap flows, bands would reunite for the work of collecting and boiling sap. It was a time of reunion and thanksgiving, both for the gift of sugar and for having made it through another winter. In the act of giving thanks, the Ojibwe would make offerings and take care not to damage the trees; their culture teaches partnership and mutual relationship with the natural world.\nOjibwe people in Wisconsin continue the traditions of collecting and boiling sap and they are using community projects like this to recover and revitalize their culture and language.\nPlease take five minutes to watch this amazing video:\nWaadookodading: Ojibwe Language Immersion School\nThe United States federal government began sending American Indian children to government-run schools in the late 1870s\u2026theways.org\nWhen the first European settlers came to North America, many sought to learn the ways that Native people lived on the land. These early European settlers learned to make maple sugar, grow maize, and hunt and fish for the North American animals and fish. In every region, white settlers learned about how to live on the land from Indigenous people, who had been living here for thousands of years. In many cases, white settlers who were kidnapped or otherwise came to live with Native people decided to stay with the Native communities rather than return to \u201ccivilized\u201d society.\nDespite the sense of kinship between some of the early European settlers and many of the Native people, much of the relationship between white people and Native people was (and still is) based on white people taking the land and resources of the Indigenous people.\nThe colonial project of the United States took stolen Indigenous land and transformed it beyond recognition. Forests were cleared for farms that raised a number of crops and animals from Europe. Bison were systemically eliminated. Rivers were dammed, and lakes were stocked with non-native fish. Prairies were plowed up and passenger pigeons were hunted to extinction. Lands were converted into plantations, and crops, animals, and people were put into the service of the owners. This model of connection to the land is one of subjugation and not mutual relationship.\nThe owners and the rest of us, who were not owners, were given the unifying story of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. The economy and prosperity grew in the USA, with growth first based on millions of acres of stolen land and the unpaid labor of enslaved Africans, then based on the underpaid labor and boundless resource extraction of the Industrial Revolution, and then based on international trade with places where wages and environmental standards are low. As long as the economy grew, enough wealth and resources would trickle down to the rest of us to sustain the unifying story (at least for white people).\nOver the last 50 or so years, the story has failed. One way that the story failed is how the ongoing colonial project continues to make everything seem the same, and how it turns us all into consumers. It removes us from a mutual relationship with the land.\nWhen I was growing up, the food we ate came from the grocery store. We never had real maple syrup. That was for rich people. We didn\u2019t have real butter, and most of our vegetables were either canned or frozen. My experience of food was as a mid-level end consumer.\nMy food experience and my suburban childhood were only tangentially connected to the land. I did visit our family\u2019s cabin, but aside from fishing and picking berries, my experience of that land was essentially to be a consumer of recreational experiences.\nIt is interesting to me that white folks who are raised urban or suburban (like me) have been systematically disconnected from non-recreational ways to connect to the land and each other, and that disconnection is an echo of the original dispossession from the lands of the Indigenous people of this continent. The capitalist colonial project is one that requires almost all participants to disconnect from each other, the land, and any unique culture rooted in the land.\nAn antidote to the homogenizing capitalist colonial project is to reroot community and culture in specific places and practices.\nWhen I came to my current job as a teacher for a Montessori school on a farm and I learned that one of my jobs was to collect and boil maple sap, I was very excited. I learned to identify maple trees in the winter, and I learned how to tell the exact moment when sap turned into syrup. For the first time in my life, I had access to as much maple syrup for my pancakes as I could ever want. I felt rich! And I was! And I wanted to share that experience. I am pleased to share the joy and work of making syrup with as many people as I can involve.\nBoiling sap, almost syrup! (my photo)\nThis is one way that our school community gathers around the work of the land. We also gather around growing crops and raising animals, watching birds, maintaining trails, managing invasive species, restoring prairies and forests, caring for bees, hosting events, and more. As we go through our seasons of connecting with the land as a community, I notice other people in our area going through the same experiences, and I feel both connected to the land of our larger area and to the other people of our region.\nI feel a sense of connectedness to my rural-living neighbors who are collecting sap during this season. I feel like when they drive by in their trucks with sap and they see a bunch of city people carrying buckets of sap, that at that moment the city folks might rise a little in their estimation. Likewise, when the city folks who come out to help collect sap see a truck driving by with sap, and see me stop to talk shop, that their impression of rural folks might rise a little. Sharing work makes us see the humanity in the other.\nI can imagine a different world, where all communities are rooted in the many seasonal varieties of work of the land. Where city people are called to the countryside to help with the harvests. Where wild areas and waters are protected because they are the spiritual and real source of the community\u2019s connections to each other and the land. Where Indigenous knowledge and ways are valued just as much or more than industrial production.\nIf we could root communities in the necessary work of the land, it could provide us with a new inclusive collective story. That story could be inclusive of all people if we could somehow divorce it from the capitalist colonial ethic of exploitation and concentration of wealth and power.\nOne concern that I have is that this new story could become just another way for white people to steal from Indigenous people and cultures, again. There is simply not enough wild rice for hoards of white folks to go out and hand-harvest it, without cutting into the supply available to Native people. Likewise, many white folks are excited about foraging wild mushrooms, but they have depleted the supplies of the slow-growing chagas fungus, which is a key medicine for some Ojibwe people.\nWe would need to prioritize access for Indigenous people, even as we grow the land connections for other folks. This would require a level of coordination and trust, which could actually build cross-community connections. An example of this is how, after the Native tribes of Wisconsin won the court cases which allowed them to fully exercise their treaty rights to fish outside of Wisconsin DNR rules for other people, instead of depleting the fish stocks, they worked with DNR managers to collectively manage and grow the resources. It is not impossible.\nThe way that people build community connections to the land and each other would be key to determining whether those actions build solidarity and connection, or whether those actions are exploitative and appropriative.\nOne other concern is that any \u201csingle story\u201d will exclude and divide people, whatever it is. Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie warns us of the danger of any single story in this excellent Ted talk. I think one advantage of this new unifying story, is that the details will change with the locations. Another advantage is that this new story is rooted in the land and sustainability. Many of our previous unifying stories have been uprooted and disconnected from the land.\nI am aware that by proposing that we re-localize food systems to bring people together, I can come off as bougie and out of touch. Right now, the people who love small farms and hand-harvested food need extra money to pay the premium. This was my experience as a young person \u2014 maple syrup was for rich people, sort of like downhill skiing and staying in fancy hotels. My point is that we need to move maple syrup and other local food connections to place from the \u201cbougie consumer\u201d column to the \u201caccessible to everyone\u201d column. That would require a concerted effort from schools, local governments, and community organizations.\nI think a love of place is something that we can build community upon, across lines of class and race. I have seen this with community pride around sports teams. Almost all of Wisconsin (and beyond!) seems to agree on a love of the Green Bay Packers. If the Packers could be an example of a single, inclusive unifying story, perhaps we can see how stories built on a shared sense of place and purpose could bring people together.", "comment_count": 1, "like_count": 54, "created_time": 1650403452269, "comment": [{"user_id": "12223ba38f45", "comment_time": 1650403452269, "comment": "Thank you for sharing!"}, {"user_id": "34a0fec5d0ff", "comment_time": 1650919637220, "comment": "funny"}], "post_tag": ["Maple Syrup", "Politics", "Margaret Atwood", "Solidarity", "Montessori"]}, {"author": "Middle East Eye", "post_id": "fc2335ef7af1", "user_id": "750acc1e088f", "title": "\u2018I miss Jamal\u2019: Khashoggi\u2019s fiance shares her grief with Congress", "content": "\u2018I miss Jamal\u2019: Khashoggi\u2019s fiance shares her grief with Congress\nHatce Cengiz laments that \u2018nothing was done\u2019 about murder over past six months\n\nHatce Cengiz urges lawmakers to ensure justice for Khashoggi (MEE/Ali Harb)\nBy Ali Harb in Washington\nPublished date: 17 May 2019 00:36 UTC|\nHatce Cengiz had hoped to start a \u201cbeautiful life\u201d with her fiance Jamal Khashoggi in Washington.\nInstead, on her first trip to the US capital on Thursday, Cengiz shared with American lawmakers her grief for the slain journalist.\n\u201cAlthough he is gone, I feel his presence here right now\u2026 I miss Jamal and his ideals,\u201d she said at an event honouring her at the US Capitol building.\nKhashoggi, a Washington Post columnist and critic of the Saudi royal family, was murdered by Saudi government agents at the kingdom\u2019s consulate in Istanbul late last year while trying to retrieve personal paperwork for his forthcoming marriage to Cengiz.\nLawmakers from both major parties congratulated Cengiz for her courage and denounced the increased threats to journalists around the world.\n\u201cJamal was the target of unspeakably brutal violence sanctioned as retribution for speaking out for human rights and freedom in his homeland,\u201d Congressman Adam Schiff, co-chair of the Press Freedom Caucus, said before introducing Cengiz.\nSchiff, a top Democrat, said that Khashoggi was passionate about the cause of freedom, human rights and democracy in Saudi Arabia, adding that his death should be a \u201ccatalyst\u201d for protecting journalists everywhere.\n\nSaudi activist Abdullah Alaoudh: MBS has no popular legitimacy\nRead More \u00bb\nFor his part, Congressman Steve Chabot, the Republican co-chair of the caucus, stressed the importance of a free press, saying that Khashoggi\u2019s murder was \u201creprehensible\u201d and \u201chorrific.\u201d\nEarlier on Thursday, Cengiz described her enormous personal loss to lawmakers at a House of Representatives committee on human rights, calling on Congress to ensure justice for the late journalist.\n\u201cI was happier than I had ever been in my life,\u201d Cengiz, a Turkish graduate student, told lawmakers of her plans to marry Khashoggi.\n\u201cAs I was heading for such an exciting start, the fact that it was suddenly cut on 2 October, I still cannot make sense of it.\u201d\n\u2018Nothing was done\u2019\nIn her testimony, Cengiz lamented that \u201cnothing was done\u201d about the murder over the past six months.\nAlthough Congress has repeatedly condemned the kingdom for the murder, the White House has largely stood by Saudi Arabia\u2019s powerful Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who was responsible for the crime, according to the CIA\u2019s conclusion. Saudi Arabia vigorously disputes that.\nThe US Senate also passed a unanimous resolution late last year saying that it believes the crown prince was behind the killing.\n\u2018We have two choices, that we can either go on as if nothing happened, or we can put aside all politics and international interests and focus on our values for a better life.\u2019\n-Hatice Cengis\nStill, despite the global outrage, President Donald Trump has defended bin Salman and missed a deadline mandated by lawmakers through the Global Magnitsky Act, a US human rights law, to share findings about the perpetrators of the murder.\nOn Thursday, Cengiz criticised Washington\u2019s response to the murder, saying that the values that the US represents were also murdered when Khashoggi was killed.\n\u201cWe have two choices, that we can either go on as if nothing happened, or we can put aside all politics and international interests and focus on our values for a better life,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThe legal procedure that Saudi Arabia undertook is not transparent,\u201d she added, speaking through a translator. \u201cWe still do not know why he was killed. We don\u2019t know where his corpse is.\u201d\nShe urged lawmakers to back an international investigation to compel Saudi Arabia to reveal the details of the crime. She also called for sanctions against the kingdom to ensure justice for Khashoggi and to help other dissidents who remain behind bars.\n\u201cThe reason that Jamal moved to the United States is because there were other people like him in prison in Saudi Arabia who could not voice their own opinions. And he felt responsible for them, and he said, \u2018In the United States I can be their voice,\u2019\u201d Cengiz told lawmakers.\n\u201cIf we cannot bring him back, maybe at least we can free those people.\u201d", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 0, "created_time": 1558071179604, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Saudi Arabia"]}, {"author": "Middle East Eye", "post_id": "5f6c714c5eb2", "user_id": "750acc1e088f", "title": "Qatar mall \u2018family only\u2019 rule seen as discriminating against migrant workers", "content": "Qatar mall \u2018family only\u2019 rule seen as discriminating against migrant workers\nImplementation of family-only day follows online discussions on migrant workers \u2018crowding\u2019 new shopping complex at Eid\nA worker on the sea promenade in Doha during renovation ahead of Qatar\u2019s 2022 World Cup (AFP)\nBy Ghufrane Mounir\nPublished date: 4 May 2022 16:34 UTC\nNew regulations at a mall in an upscale area of Qatar, which restrict admission to families on Fridays, are being interpreted as an attempt to exclude migrant workers, following complaints from some Qataris that they were \u201cflooding\u201d the complex on Eid.\nA video released on social media of migrant workers visiting Qatar\u2019s newly constructed Place Vendome mall has gone viral in the country, with some netizens lamenting the massive crowds for their \u201cdisorganisation\u201d and \u201cchaos\u201d.\n\u201cI am deeply worried as a Qatari citizen about the entrance of migrant workers in these overwhelming numbers on Eid in shopping complexes, in which we cannot be sure of the safety of our families in the midst of this large number of single men who are relatively uneducated,\u201d wrote one prominent Qatari social media user.\nThe \u201cluxurious\u201d mall in Lusail city, which includes three hotels, restaurants, international brand shops and a fully air-conditioned outdoor area, opened in April and is inspired by Paris\u2019s high-end shopping district, Rue de la Paix.\nBut less than a month after its debut, the mall has drawn attention for the wrong reasons, with some Qataris denouncing the migrant workers visiting the mall on their Eid holiday as harmful for the \u201cmall\u2019s image and for families\u201d.\nTranslation: The mall is a shopping complex owned by millionaires may God bless them, not a public playground or a corniche where random people can just walk around and dance\nTranslation: Before you blame or accuse someone of racism understand this: Until someone from your family gets harmed then you will not understand what it means to have kids around these workers who come from difficult backgrounds. Some people act as ideal individuals until the harm comes by them directly.\nTranslation: Whoever agrees with this behaviour has no concern over the women of his household mixing with workers who we have no idea what religion they follow or what their culture is like.\nOne individual alluded to the crowd of foreign workers as \u201cdangerous for women in society\u201d, arguing that \u201csociety has to be organised in a manner that prioritises their protection\u201d.\nTranslation: It is a duty for everyone to organise society to protect women and their status and to prevent harassment\u2026\nTranslation: They [migrant workers] are welcome to visit provided that the capacity is regulated\u2026 Criticism is the duty every man to preserve the entity of society, especially in the presence of a major imbalance in the demographic structure.\nAlmost immediately after the criticisms surfaced online, Place Vendome\u2019s official Instagram page updated the mall\u2019s opening hours, indicating that the mall will only be open for families from 4\u20137 May \u2014 virtually aligning with the country\u2019s Eid holidays \u2014 and that from 13 May every Friday will be designated as a family-only day.\nWhile the concept of \u201cfamily only\u201d is not unusual in Qatar \u2014 with several parks and malls restricting access to families on specific days of the week \u2014 many on social media interpreted this as a code to \u201cdiscriminate against migrant workers\u201d, most of whom have Friday as their only day off. (Place Vendome didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.)\nTranslation: I am surprised by the reactions against some residents accessing and enjoying the country\u2019s facilities. These places were not opened to receive one exclusive race. It is not from our traditions to belittle and not welcome people. How can we speak of development with these narratives?\nTranslation: Yes, let\u2019s expel the migrant worker, on the condition that you clean your own dirt and you work 12 hours under the heat \u2014 you simply cannot function without them as they work on behalf of you.\nOthers claimed ironically that anti-migrant rhetoric in the mall resembles racist arguments made against Arabs in the West.\nTranslation: As a \u201cBritish citizen\u201d, I was very upset by the huge number of Arabs entering Harrods on Christmas yesterday, as our families could not be sure of our safety in the face of a huge number of relatively uneducated Arabs.\nOne social media user called for the start of a hashtag dubbed #QatarForAll in an attempt to counteract the current of \u201cracist\u201d rhetoric online.\nSeveral locals also expressed reservations about the country\u2019s ability to host the World Cup, with the Eid crowds casting doubt on the country\u2019s readiness for the football spectacular in November.\nTranslation: Are we really ready to host the World Cup with these crowds and in this manner?\nTranslation: A question for the citizens and residents of Qatar. It is Eid and this is the crowd and situation of the country, almost everything is closed from the crowdedness.

As a result, the prices of petrol and fuel rose.\nIn 2021, the European Union and the United Kingdom had imported 70 percent of their LNG needs from the US (26 percent), Qatar (24 percent) and Russia (20 percent), according to figures by Cedigaz, a natural gas information group.\nDoha was under immense pressure to help Europe steer away from dependency on Russian gas, but said it was locked with years-long LNG contracts with Asian countries and that replacing Russian gas was impossible in the short term.\nHowever, the country plans to complete a colossal export project by the end of this decade, which will enhance its place as the Middle East\u2019s number one gas supplier.\nIt shares with Iran the world\u2019s largest gas field in the Gulf, the North Field, and exports the super-chilled natural gas from its port of Ras Laffan, north of Doha.\nIn 2022, it has shipped $100bn-worth of energy products to Asian and European markets, and its economy is expected to grow 4.4 percent this year.\nIn February, its neighbour, Saudi Arabia, discovered natural gas fields in four regions.\nAccording to Bloomberg, Qatar\u2019s potential to replace the Russian gas export to Europe will lend the tiny country of 2.8 million population an influential position in world affairs.\nThe country will host the Fifa World Cup 2022 in November and December, the first Muslim and Arab country to do so.\n\u201cAs the World Cup showcases its ability to acquire international prestige, Qatar\u2019s status as a much-coveted gas supplier is promising to turn the tiny peninsula into the bigger player it always aspired to be,\u201d wrote Paul Wallace and Simone Foxman in Bloomberg.", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 0, "created_time": 1651596563699, "comment": [], "post_tag": []}, {"author": "Middle East Eye", "post_id": "237246d358", "user_id": "750acc1e088f", "title": "Biden to blame for US energy crisis, says former Saudi intelligence chief", "content": "Biden to blame for US energy crisis, says former Saudi intelligence chief\nPrince Turki al-Faisal, who also previously served as Saudi ambassador to the US, says \u2018America itself\u2019 is to blame for high energy prices\nPrince Turki al-Faisal speaks at the Concordia Summit in New York City in October 2015 (AFP)\nBy MEE staff\nPublished date: 2 May 2022 21:31 UTC\nTop Saudi royal and former intelligence chief Prince Turki al-Faisal pushed back on Monday against claims that the kingdom was at fault for rising energy prices in the US, instead putting the blame on the Biden administration.\n\u201cWhen you say that Saudi Arabia has not budged on the issue of the oil problems that America is facing, basically America itself is the reason for the state that they\u2019re in because of their energy policy,\u201d Faisal told the state-run Arab News.\nIn October, Biden directly accused Opec, a group of oil producers including Saudi Arabia, which is the leading crude oil producer of the organisation, of withholding supply and driving up gasoline prices in the US.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of Middle Eastern folks who want to talk to me,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019m going to talk to them.\u201d\nCalls for the kingdom to increase production only accelerated after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine exacerbated the rise in energy prices, with the national average price for gasoline in the US hitting a record high in March of $4.17 a gallon.\nThat has helped drive up inflation and is seen as denting Biden\u2019s party\u2019s hopes for midterm elections later this year.\nIn April, a group of Democratic lawmakers sent a letter to Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, citing the kingdom\u2019s resistance to increasing oil production as one of many reasons to \u201crecalibrate\u201d the US\u2019s partnership with Saudi Arabia.\nFaisal, a former US ambassador and now chairman of the King Faisal Center for Research and Islamic Studies based in Riyadh, said the Biden administration\u2019s policies were responsible for the rise in US gasoline prices.\n\u201cPresident Biden made it a policy of the US government to cut all links to\u2026the oil and gas industry, and he curtailed the oil production and gas production in the US\u2026that has helped bring up the prices of oil,\u201d Faisal said.\nSaudi Arabia supplies the US with about five percent of its crude oil and petroleum imports, and its status as home to the world\u2019s second-largest reserves of oil, along with its ability to ramp up or down production, gives it the power to sway global energy markets.\nHowever, in recent years, the US has emerged as one of the world\u2019s biggest oil producers, driven in part by a boom in fracking. That has allowed the US to drastically reduce its reliance on foreign supplies but has also stirred criticism among many progressives in Biden\u2019s party who are pushing for a rapid transition to green energy.\nSaudi Arabia \u2018let down\u2019 by US\nAt the heart of differences between Saudi Arabia and the US over oil production is an Opec agreement made with Russia to marginally increase supply. Made in 2020, the deal followed a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia that sent prices tumbling and also hit US producers.\nFaisal on Monday defended Saudi Arabia\u2019s refusal to break with the pact despite Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. \u201cThat is an agreement that is for the benefit of everybody and that is for the stability of oil prices,\u201d he said.\nHe added that price pressures stemmed from new security threats in Ukraine driving up insurance rates, \u201cplus the European and American curtailment and sanction of the Russian oil industry\u201d, in response to Moscow\u2019s invasion.\nDiscussing the strain in bilateral ties, Faisal pointed to the Biden administration\u2019s handling of regional security issues and said the kingdom felt \u201clet down\u201d by the US\u2019s position on the war in Yemen.\nThe Biden administration has criticised the Saudi-led war effort against Iran-aligned Houthis in Yemen, and one of the first acts of the administration was to suspend offensive military support to Riyadh. The Gulf powers have also been alarmed by what they view as the US\u2019s tepid response to recent Houthi missile and drone attacks.\nWashington\u2019s critique of human rights issues has also irked Riyadh. On the campaign trail, Biden pledged to make Saudi Arabia the \u201cpariah that they are\u201d for the 2018 murder of Middle East Eye and Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, and famously ruled out dealing directly with the country\u2019s de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had our ups and downs over the years, and perhaps at this time it\u2019s one of the downs,\u201d Faisal said, \u201cparticularly since the president of the United States in his election campaign said that he will make Saudi Arabia a pariah, and of course, he went on to practise what he preached.\u201d", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 0, "created_time": 1651572693521, "comment": [], "post_tag": []}, {"author": "Jeremy Littau", "post_id": "387e90bdd86f", "user_id": "a378c991f033", "title": "A journalist\u2019s grief overRachel Held Evans", "content": "A journalist\u2019s grief over Rachel Held Evans\nRachel Held Evans, 37, passed away this morning. My heart is in shock, but deeper down I really understand that we lost an important writer in these turbulent times.\nMany of us who have emerged from a fundamentalist upbringing feel like we\u2019ve lost a family member today. Evans had become an important voice for many he past 10 years as we watched the church we grew up in increasingly embrace a political form of institutional racism, homophobia, and sexism. Evans gave us space for lament, but also for realization. Our current political moment is not a moment, but a culmination of institutional problems that some of us had been blind to in our churches for years (and this includes me). Evans\u2019 work was convicting because it challenged us to not be ignorant, and that in the face of revelation our only charge was to stand for justice.\nRachel Held Evans was our voice, helped us find our voice, and helped us use our voice. Her writing has kept me sane the past couple years, but it also has felt like she\u2019s walked a journey with me out of the confusion and darkness I found myself in a few years ago.\nHer work was rooted in justice, and demanded that our hard questions be answered in empathy and love. She called out the systemic toxic sexism, racism, abusive culture, and patriarchy that is embedded in white Evangelical church culture \u2014 she was a critic who loved the church and its people but who also grieved what it had become in America.\nOne thing I loved about her work is she constantly was repping underrepresented authors and voices. Through her work, I got a steady stream of recommendations for people to follow on social media and work to read. I heard voices and read ideas from people who never populated the churches and Christian institutions that were part of my upbringing, and it changed me forever. Better still, Evans made sure we were hearing from LGBT voices, people of color, and others who don\u2019t normally have a seat at the table, and not through her but rather directly from them. It was valuable allyship, but it was also modeling how it ought to be done.\nBut I\u2019ll let you read the voices who are saying it more cogently than I am. This Twitter Moment has a lot of them captured.\nI want to add something about what Evans meant to me as a journalist. Jack Jenkins with Religion News Service tells a story that many journalists can affirm:\n\nI\u2019ve had a couple interactions with Evans. I had hoped to base a chunk of the book I\u2019m working on around her work (I don\u2019t lament the loss of potential source material so much as the possibility of an in-person conversation; it\u2019s a goal that gave me life and animated my work). She represents a new phase in religion writing in the U.S., and she will be remembered as a trailblazer.\nBut I will tell you something else I got from my interactions with her. She is the first person I have known in the church who was truly affirming of the work journalists do. Not of me (\u201cyou\u2019re one of the good ones\u201d was my favorite backhanded Evangelical compliment) but of the work itself and how meaningful it was.\nRachel Held Evans knew the work journalists do is important. She stumped for it constantly in her writing and on social media because she knew that the search for truth \u2014 any truth, regardless of the answers we find \u2014 was compatible with the faith journey. More to the point, she was consistently someone who understood the hard conditions journalists work under. The low pay, the constant threats of violence, the cultural derision of people just trying to do their work honestly.\nJenkins\u2019 anecdote struck me because she encouraged reporters even in disagreement.\nImagine using your light in such a way rather than taking the path too common among Fundamentalists I\u2019ve known, ripping the news media and treating us like enemies or the devil himself. If that sounds personal, it is. My friends in journalism are being threatened and demonized daily, many from quarters of the U.S. Evangelical church. Attacking them is attacking me.\nIt was partly this constant sniping and condescension that took me away from the pews. I will admit to times of bitterness and lashing out in anger and pain; the relationships in that culture run so deep that confronting abuse cuts against relationships that go back years. But Rachel\u2019s work has been healing for me the past couple years. I\u2019ve learned to confront that attitude and rest in lament, but more importantly that I\u2019ve given myself permission to get out of a situation that was killing me inside. The church has become a place of harm for many of us; I left because people like me weren\u2019t wanted, and I\u2019m learning to make peace with that because of her writing.\nRachel Held Evans gave me hope I could return someday. I\u2019ve spent today crying for what we\u2019ve lost. It feels selfish to want her with us still, because I feel like we still need her voice. I have a feeling she\u2019d tell us we have that voice too.\nBut we lost something important today. The world feels like a lesser place tonight without the hope that tomorrow will bring us more of Rachel\u2019s writing.

This is an edited, cleaned-up and expanded version.\nMy introductory mass communication class here at Lehigh is in middle of studying what objectivity means practically in U.S. news and what it ought to mean. It\u2019s my annual takedown of performative neutrality. This coming Monday we\u2019re going to do an exercise on how the news takes sides by virtue of choosing words, and we\u2019ll use the situation in Ukraine as an entry point to show how unavoidable bias is in news construction.\nWant to try it? Sure you do.\nTo play along, here\u2019s what you do. Before you go to the next paragraph, I want you describe in your own thinking what the situation with Russia and Ukraine is, but only in one word. What would you call it if you were relaying it to someone new to the news? Think of it in terms of something like \u201cThe situation is a _____\u201d or \u201c_____ is happening.\u201d What is the best descriptor?\nI\u2019ll wait\u2026..\n(Jeopardy theme plays)\nSo what word did you choose? That word matters! It frames how someone new to the story is going to perceive and frame the news out of Ukraine going forward. Their encounter with that frame shapes how they will digest facts.\nWhile there will be lots of answers in class Monday, I expect most will say something like:\nWar\nInvasion\nConflict\nAfter listing your chosen word, the goal is to get you to think about how those words differ, why they matter, and why journalists spend lots of time thinking about words and their power to shape understanding. When they are doing it well, at least.\nThink about the word you chose implies. I\u2019ll use the ones I had above as an example:\nWar: A conflict that the audience might be tempted to think of as symmetric in terms of claims, fighting ability, etc. But it is a claim about the current fight while stripping the news of all context. It ignores power imbalances, history, and dodges any sense of culpability. It also could give the impression that the conflict is happening in multiple theaters, across multiple countries. Finally, this term has more totality to it, and invites you to think of innocents caught up in it.\nInvasion: Unlike \u201cwar,\u201d this term implies an aggressor and an afflicted party. It implies a territory has been crossed into, a sovereignty violated. It is more likely than the previous term to present by nature of use the existence of a good side and a bad one.\nConflict: Similar to \u201cwar,\u201d but I personally find it a bit more stripped of violence. It\u2019s antiseptic to the point of almost playing the situation down. Marriages have conflict, not militaries. Also, it is a frame that is mostly focused on the fight, not the effects.\nYou might disagree with my take on the word meanings, and that\u2019s fine. I\u2019m not here to argue definitions but rather the effect of words. It\u2019s true that those words have precise definitions in dictionaries (which might agree mostly but diverge in parts), but words also have a public meaning when absorbed in media. Words have definitions, but also cultural, historical and moral meanings depending on the context they\u2019re used. And all of that is in play with the news.\nMy point is these words greatly differ in the public imagination and each comes with frames that shape how news users judge the same set of facts. It\u2019s why you can have multiple people encounter the same facts but see the news differently.\nNow why does this matter for objectivity? Modern journalism, defined roughly as the past 80ish years, has slowly evolved an ethic that journalists ought to be unbiased, neutral observers. It asks them to pretend they\u2019re just about the facts, ma\u2019am, and not deciding what they believe at the point of narrative creation.\nSo this exercise is a good example of how modern objectivity is bunk, and also impossible. Just choosing a word for the headline alone shapes the story.\n\u201cINVASION!\u201d\n\u201cWAR!\u201d\nThese words in 120-point type on the home page or front page of your newspaper say different things, yes? Just a single word \u2014 one! \u2014 shapes the user\u2019s understanding of the conflict. You encounter the headline and it sets expectations for everything else you consume about that story.\nAnd so these words matter tremendously. And here\u2019s the thing: those word judgement rely on a reporter\u2019s or editor\u2019s assessment of the facts. Because Putin would verrrry much like you to believe Russia has a historical claim to the idea that Ukraine has always been part of Russia. Ukraine is saying the opposite. The claimant you believe really determines the word choice. And when you choose the term, war vs. invasion, you have picked a point of view to explain the facts you\u2019ve been able to gather and verify.\nMy own view: this is an invasion. It\u2019s informed by my reading of the facts. The minute I make this choice, I am no longer a neutral observer. I can say I am, I can claim to be unbiased, but I am not.\nThe thing is, journalists do this all the time. Global warming vs. Climate Change. Protest vs. Riot. Pro-life vs. anti-choice. One reader on the thread pointed out the terms torture vs. enhanced interrogation. In many ways, democracy is about a struggle for the best ideas, and often that struggle is about getting your preferred language adopted by the press knowing that will frame how people see things. Journalists end up choosing, as well they should because it can provide understandings to lists of facts. The public simultaneously tells us in survey data they want just the facts but also want to understand the news.\nThat\u2019s why I say modern objectivity is actually performative neutrality. It\u2019s a fake dance news businesses feel like they have to sell so they can\u2019t be accused of bias. But it offloads analysis to audiences that don\u2019t have near the research base or depth on a topic to sift through it all, particularly on a complex story such as Ukraine.\nThe good news is journalists can still do objectivity without shying away from analysis in the service of truth. It looks like a return to the original version practitioners argued for in the early 20th century, and it looks like social science methods.\nSocial science weighs evidence, uses reason, tests ideas for truth. And that all happens before the narrative is crafted. The narrative, the story, is the result of this process. You test claims, show your work in the story, and serve the truth first. Objectivity is a method, not a point of view. If you want more on the history of objectivity, Tom Rosenstiel has spilled a lot of ink on the subject. He\u2019s as good as it gets on how objectivity ought to look. I recommend his \u201cElements of Journalism\u201d that he co-wrote with Bill Kovach.\nThis, by the way, should give us pause whether you\u2019re a journalist or a news consumer. This is hard. Words are imprecise. They never fully capture what is happening. There is a qualitative difference between a journalist recklessly using words and one who is struggling, revising, and upgrading their language as they know more. I know in reading this your tendency might be to say this is a diagnosis for why the news outlet you despise the most is doing it wrong, but I\u2019d urge you to have some nuance here. From the exercise above, could you confidently say you can do better on a daily basis on a wide range of topics? The nuance here should be critique of methods and motives, with the goal of making our news better.\nAnyhow, that journalists are picking sides with words (war vs. invasion) tells you they are applying this type of process. They are using their minds to weigh claims and they are providing evidence in their stories (showing their work). This is how it\u2019s supposed to be done when it\u2019s done well.\nIf there\u2019s one thing I want my students to remember from my class, it\u2019s that objectivity \u2260 lack of bias. It is impossible in practice, unattainable in reality, and makes the news unusable for audiences the more journalists try to pretend otherwise.\n\u221a Testing claims\n\u221a Pointing out lies and half-truths\n\u221a Being fair to points of view\n\u221a Researching for context\n\u221a Transparently reporting results\n\u221a Choosing words that strive for truth frames instead of pandering to bad-faith accusations of bias\nThat\u2019s how you do it.", "comment_count": 45, "like_count": 2098, "created_time": 1645845595984, "comment": [{"user_id": "a378c991f033", "comment_time": 1645845595984, "comment": "On Ukraine: Words shape facts, shape understanding"}, {"user_id": "bd3f8cc74191", "comment_time": 1646144679534, "comment": "I strongly disagree with characterizing the use of \"invasion\" for what Russia did as implying bias of any kind.

Certainly we accomplished some things, as the conferred degrees can attest. I\u2019m absolutely certain students learned some things in my classes. But we did not pretend that it was ideal, or at least I was determined to not do the THIS IS FINE thing. It was difficult, and a moment to be survived. I left space for lament in classes for this reason.\nI found out during spring break 2020 that we were going online for the second half of the spring semester. I\u2019d been quietly been making plans for at least a temporary online shift for about six weeks, mindful of the virus news getting increasingly bad. But in my foolishness, I figured maybe a couple weeks or a month. Instead, our seniors lost their ability to be together, to graduate in person, and to say goodbye properly.\nWhat followed was the most difficult year of my life. I don\u2019t want to oversell this because I lived with the privilege of having the ability to manage my job from home. But that didn\u2019t make it easy. My wife was working full time from home just as I did, and we had kids at home eager for attention and a taste of normalcy. Their lives were upended too. \u201cWhen the germs go away, I can \u2026\u201d as my little one is fond of saying.\nUniversities run on faculty service, and apropos of associate-level professors I\u2019m at a point in my career where I was already overloaded with service; during the pandemic, service needs increased exponentially. Struggling students, AWOL students, mental health woes all made the work heavier and more necessary at a time when my work/life balance was atrocious and the job became a 7-day-a-week deal.\nI told my students early and often to focus on what they could control. We had no control of the virus, but we could control the people we would be during this pandemic, and the type of person we\u2019d emerge as. We could choose love and community, or we could choose self-centeredness. Certainly anger and bitterness are understandable, but they are not places we can stay without getting stuck. Our choices were the one thing we retained, and so we should use them wisely.\nA few things I\u2019ve been jotting down as I went, saving for the day I\u2019d write this post:\nThe most heartening thing I saw from students was their understanding. They knew I was parenting while teaching. They asked about the kids and welcomed class Zoombombs. The first time I was asked how I was holding up, I didn\u2019t know how to respond. But I appreciated it every time.\nI will never forget those moments of graciousness people showed one another. It was a salve for the nonsense I\u2019d see on TV and social media.\nStaff made this whole thing go. They are the unsung heroes in higher ed anyhow, but this whole thing would not have been possible without our friends who held the ship together in technology, student support, office work, and so on. I am so deeply grateful for my staff colleagues at Lehigh.\nI saw examples online at times of parents and students complaining about \u201clazy\u201d faculty wanting to teach at home in their sweatpants. I tried to let this roll off me, but it did bother me at times and got me riled up more than once. I have yet to hear a colleague say they preferred this mode of teaching. We pretty universally hated that it was necessary. We were dealing with health concerns, childcare issues, elder care issues, and a whole host of other things. We were stressed out and constantly battling the competing needs of our students and families. We are all looking forward to being back. Again, I have some privilege here, but please be kind to teachers. We had a rough year, we know this wasn\u2019t our best format, but we did everything we could to make it excellent.\nSacrifices included my scholarship, which is supposed to be 40% of my weekly effort but lol like that was happening. Carving out time to write in a house with no quiet and crazy advising/teaching demands was impossible. This was a lost year for a lot of us in that regard. Tenure and promotion committees are going to have to grapple with this, and I\u2019d beg my fellow academics to choose the human path of expecting less rather than just extending clocks and timelines.\nI had a whole bit here about the wonder of our technology making this past year possible, but Jeff Jarvis said it best and you should just read that.\nI\u2019m more convinced than ever that the work of the university is relationships. Yes, I can transmit material in online classes. But the real secret sauce of higher education is learning in community. That\u2019s why I designed all my teaching around community first, material second. It\u2019s why I can\u2019t wait to go back, and why I will cherish the picture atop this post. It was emotional seeing students again in person after 14 months. It\u2019s not because of a ceremony. It\u2019s because you are part of each other\u2019s lives for four years and those relationships matter, something that can\u2019t be built as well in Zoom.\nWhat we build out of this pandemic is going to matter. We cannot go back to business as usual. The pandemic surfaced inequities, financial aid gaps, food and technology insecurities, and the challenges everyone is facing daily. We should rebuild with purpose, treating solving those inequities as Job 1 when we get back. It changed me as a professor, and I will be applying that forward.\nFinally, my students are resilient people. I don\u2019t want to say \u201ctough\u201d because I don\u2019t want to valorize the notion that we just have to suck it up and not complain. Instead, I\u2019ll just note they got through it, and that says a lot about them just to reach the finish line. Ignore their grades and resume gaps. They finished. That alone is worthy of our praise.\nWe are at the other end of the telescope, as U2\u2019s lyrics above note. What once seemed big seems small, because the past 14 months were spent clarifying about what really matters. If there\u2019s anything we can take away from this time, other than the really cool vaccines that science gave us, it\u2019s that it should reorient us toward keeping the focus on our values.\nI can\u2019t wait to see my students this fall and teach in person.\nJeremy Littau is an associate professor of journalism and communication at Lehigh University.", "comment_count": 1, "like_count": 11, "created_time": 1622067807761, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Covid", "Higher Education", "Zoom", "Community", "Journalism"]}, {"author": "Jeremy Littau", "post_id": "344680f2b2ba", "user_id": "a378c991f033", "title": "Opening remarks for Media And Society", "content": "Opening remarks for Media And Society\nClasses started this week at Lehigh. Every year I teach at least one section of our introductory course, COMM 001 Media And Society. I still think of it as some of my most urgent work. It exists to help students understand the business of media, how it\u2019s structured, and its powerful way of influencing, well, everything. In a time of disinformation and danger, the work is even more important. What follows is a Zoom transcript of my short introduction on syllabus day, edited for grammar and clarity.\n\u2014 \u2014\nSo this morning I was thinking about a couple different things that are disconnected and yet particularly relevant to why I\u2019m teaching this class and why I think this class is important for you to take. I come to you this morning with a sense of urgency, because our democracy in the U.S. is in peril.\nThe first thread is some of the aftermath of the Capitol riots here in United States. On the sixth of January, we had a group of people turn up for a protest at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, DC. and then they decided to take their protests over the barricades and inside of the building. Members of Congress, gathered to count the certified votes from the recent presidential election, had to evacuate the chamber and put the capital on lockdown. The security fences that they\u2019ve had to erect in the aftermath remain there, to this day, because we finally are waking up to the long-term problem with homegrown white nationalist terrorism we have long had in this country.\nNow, this is not a political science class, but this is a communication course and one of the things that we are going to talk about in this class is extremism online and how the events of January 6 \u2014 if you were paying attention to the news, if you were aware of the kinds of things that were happening in online groups on social networks in Facebook and so forth \u2014 were the places not only where these groups forming, but also where they were circulating disinformation to recruit and radicalize others.\nThey were circulating disinformation that was related to conspiracy theories, outright lies, and there was a whole lot of manufactured media distrust built into some of those groups. And so the seeds the seeds of that moment on January 6, were planted years ago. It is the media angle that will be covered this class.\nWe will talk about how you should have seen this coming. I was in a class last semester where we talked about QAnon. Some of you may have heard of Q. It\u2019s an online conspiracy theory that has been growing on the Internet since 2017. Several of my classes have tried to focus on the movement, where it was forming, and how it\u2019s grown to the point where you should be able to spot it in the wild if you know what to look for. When Q paraphernalia started showing up among the Capitol rioters on January 6, it was not a surprise to me. I saw this coming because, because I was aware of the media environment that a lot of these folks were living in and what it was doing to them \u2014 and us \u2014 long term.\nThe second thread I\u2019ve been thinking about this morning came from surfing Facebook last week. I\u2019ve been seeing some discussion on the side from some people I know and their friends about the COVID vaccine for months now, and it got really bad this past week. In this case, I was thinking about a post from a college friend of mine who got the vaccine.\nAbout three weeks ago they posted a nice report saying, \u201cHey, I got my second shot it had no side effects and really excited to have this,\u201d and then watched as the downstream comments turned negative and conspiracy-minded in a hurry. \u201cI don\u2019t trust corporations with this thing,\u201d or \u201cIt isn\u2019t going to work,\u201d or \u201cBill Gates is going to be tracking me because he\u2019s been funding vaccine research,\u201d and so forth. And so we\u2019re dealing again with distrust, conspiracy theories, distrust in the media and in the news.\nSome of the commenters, I sometimes take a look because I know them peripherally. Many are in the very age group we\u2019re trying to protect. They are the old or people with major illnesses that make them susceptible. They are people without health insurance and frontline essential workers. People who are much more susceptible to the worst effects of this virus.\nI think about these situations as the great paradox of our time, one that we will pick at all semester in this class: We have more information at our fingertips than any other generation in human history right now and yet we cannot agree on basic facts in society.\nAnd the results are disastrous. The U.S., with all its wealth, technology and know-how, is royally screwing up its handling of COVID. It\u2019s unthinkable and yet unsurprising if you know anything about the state of information and news in the U.S. in 2021.\nIt\u2019s not just COVID, though. There are long term consequences to the health of our democracy and our ability to self-govern if we cannot figure out a way to not only come up with a common definition for what trust and verification looks like, but also to decide what is a source that is junk versus one is to be trusted. So the early part of this class we\u2019re going to be talking a lot about media platforms and the places information comes from. We\u2019ll talk about methods of persuasion so forth, but the second half of this class is largely devoted to some of the some of the downhill effects of our polluted information ecosystem. That\u2019s the \u201csociety\u201d part of Media And Society.\nI\u2019ve read your survey responses as they have been coming in. Many of you have said you\u2019re really interested in this idea about media and its effect on us, and a lot of you are thinking narrowly about its effect on yourselves. But I want you to step back and see the bigger \u201cus,\u201d not just as this community in this class, but also as a wider member of society. The society you live in, or the society that you decided to live in when you came to Bethlehem.\nYou are part of a larger collective. Whether you\u2019re the kind of person who\u2019s going to buy into an online conspiracy theory or not, you have neighbors who do you and you have friends who do. It has effects and impacts on us, and we are all in this together. If the pandemic has made nothing else clear, it\u2019s that our fates are linked.\nSo I have found this class to become much more of an urgent thing that I teach with each passing year since I started in 2009, because the questions have gotten more serious.\nThere are things we have to figure out really quickly, as these products grow and get sprung on us, deployed without our consent and take over large pockets of discussion and society. We are affected by these things, even if we don\u2019t choose to use them. So I want to give you tools this semester, to be able to figure out answers to some basic questions:\nWhat is news?\nWhat is good versus bad news?\nWhat is fake news, something that people say a lot but often don\u2019t really know what they\u2019re talking about?\nWhat are some of the ways in which we can figure out how to build verification and trust, and I think more importantly, how do we build bridges to people who don\u2019t get it?\nThere\u2019s a real systemic problem that we\u2019re going to be unpacking and have you talking a lot about. From online white nationalism to hate groups, we\u2019re going to be talking a lot about the ways in which they spread information and use platforms to amplify and build and recruit.\nIn the second half of this class, this will get a lot more real, but I want to make this class as relevant as possible to the moment, and so we are going to be doing a lot of that work as we go.\nYes, we will be talking about fun things like your finstas and your pet Instagram that you run as a side hustle and your Snap streak.\nThings like that.\nBut we\u2019re also going to talk about some deeper heavier issues, and because this is a social science class that links up to things like sociology, psychology, and political science. You\u2019re going to find that this class will straddle multiple fields.\nMy hope is that you will find something here that is interesting, that you can take with you as you go forward whether you\u2019re planning on majoring in journalism or you\u2019re just really interested in that topic. There will be something for everyone, it will be relevant, and I hope we can get to work now in thinking about ways we\u2019re going to help fix the problems society is facing.\nJeremy Littau is an associate professor of journalism at Lehigh University.

Flickr\nA war started this week in Ukraine. Russian president Vladimir Putin finally began the campaign he\u2019s been signaling towards for quite some time. The images coming from Ukraine have been horrifying as observers the world over admire the fighting strength of the nation\u2019s people.\nHowever, one initial reaction to the war has been especially embarrassing for a select group of pundits and commentators: \u201cthe war started because of pronouns.\u201d\nA number of conservative figures, like Donald Trump Jr and Ben Shapiro, along with a smattering of so-called radical feminists in Great Britain, decided to spill this brain-wormed take as Russian tanks rolled down Ukrainian roads and Russian bombs smashed into hospitals and schools alike.\n\n\nActually, \u201cthe war started because of pronouns\u201d is an oversimplified version of their actual take, which was that Putin sensed the west was weak because we\u2019ve been obsessing over pronouns and transgenderism. It\u2019s peak \u201cmy pet issue is actually responsible for every problem\u201d thinking and it\u2019s frankly humiliating for those who espouse this.\n\nYou see, it\u2019s not \u201cthe west\u201d that\u2019s been obsessed with \u201ctransgenderism,\u201d it\u2019s not even transgender people that\u2019ve been obsessed with \u201cpronouns.\u201d It\u2019s been the far right all along.\nIt was the far right who developed exactly one joke (tm) total, about pronouns no less.\n\n\nIt\u2019s been people on the far right who have developed entire careers out of shitting on trans people. It\u2019s been right wing columnists who continuously bang on about transgender people. It was the right who banned trans people from the US military. It\u2019s the far right who have proposed hundreds of laws designed to run trans people out of public life in the west.\nTrans people are just out here existing. Of course they\u2019re going to have input on things like trans policy and pronoun bullshit, it\u2019s literally their lives. It\u2019s no different than farmers speaking up about the price of eggs or wheat or miners speaking up about safety conditions of the mine.\nBut it\u2019s the right that truly has a sick obsession with trans people and trans issues.\nSo if an obsession with pronouns makes a group of people weak, the evidence here is that the far right is the weakest among us, and it\u2019s not even close.\nThis doesn\u2019t surprise trans people, who are significantly more likely than the general population to enlist in US military service, and who also go through life getting constant, daily shit from the biggest losers society has to offer. This will be hard for the Ben Shapiros of the world to accept, but the sheer reality is that the average trans person is significantly harder than the average right wing chud and it\u2019s not even close.\nIn the current right-wing and gender-critical fantasy, Putin is the strong man the world needs to righteously stand up for white people against the threat of wokeness and transgenderism, and his invasion of Ukraine is the opening military salvo of a new phase of the culture war.\nThis is, of course, unhinged and out of touch with reality. It\u2019s a thought borne out of an obsession with political grievance and the culture war.\nThe actual war in Ukraine now exposes the pettiness and fecklessness of the west\u2019s culture warriors. In the face of actual bombs thrown by actual fascists, the fact that the New York Times has three writers devoted to cancel culture and zero devoted to the global rise of fascism pulls back the curtain on the ridiculous decision-making of American media makers.\nPutin has become a figure of admiration on the American and international right. We first saw this during the Obama administration as photos of a shirtless Putin riding on a horse were compared to a picture of former president Obama in \u201cmom jeans.\u201d The relationship between Putin and the far right has deepened to the point where major far right media figures like Tucker Carlson vehemently defend the Russian oligarch even this week.\nUkrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy on the other hand has not had the same treatment. This is the leader, it should be noted, who declined to accept former President Trump\u2019s bribe to start an investigation into Joe Biden, which led to Trump\u2019s first impeachment. Zelenskyy wanted more stinger missile launchers, a weapon that is reported to be having a great effect for Ukraine\u2019s defense. Trump asked for corruption in return.\nZelenskyy instead has gone on to become a legendary leader of Ukraine in the opening days of this war, inspiring his people to fight to the death while alleged strongman Putin is forced to watch from his palace back home as his tanks and planes keep blowing up.\n\nOut of this conflict, the perception of Putin as strong is being challenged. His military seems to be suffering repeated humiliating defeats and his troops and equipment appear shoddy and disorganized. This is not what a strong man\u2019s army is supposed to look like.\n\n\nIf we were to accept the right\u2019s conception of the cultural conflict at play here, that Putin is the strong man defending Judeo-Christian cultural values and Ukraine is the weak, decadent left, obsessed with pronouns, then the pronouns seem to be winning.\nIt\u2019s of course a ridiculous analogy, but the reality of actual war crashing against the anti-woke fa\u00e7ade of the American culture warrior is beginning to show cracks in the ideology of the latter. It\u2019s long past time we stopped taking these charlatans seriously.\nThey have proven themselves weak, and incapable of thought about other, more serious issues. They\u2019re an instrument that only plays one note, no matter how dire the state of the world becomes. I realize it\u2019s very popular these days to react with disgust at the idea of a trans woman or whatever, and then post about it for clout, but good lord dudes, there\u2019s a war on.\nConstantly moaning about trans people doesn\u2019t make you tough. Stamping trans people out of society doesn\u2019t make an army better at war. It just makes you look sad and pathetic, like a Russian tank that\u2019s ran out of gas in the middle of a Ukrainian plain.\nIf your first reaction to any sort of news is \u201cwe need to bash the tr*nnies,\u201d you don\u2019t need a strongman, you need therapy.", "comment_count": 50, "like_count": 3479, "created_time": 1645884206766, "comment": [{"user_id": "95a57fdeadb6", "comment_time": 1645884206766, "comment": "No, the War in Ukraine Isn\u2019t Because of Pronouns"}, {"user_id": "34b2fa2be796", "comment_time": 1645951437370, "comment": "They may sound silly, but the sad truth is they have a point."}, {"user_id": "12e252dd5744", "comment_time": 1646078465141, "comment": "Guys, i am sitting right now in the basement because russians are bombing Kiev and such articles just make me laugh, Putin invades our country because he knows, all the western world can do is sanctions, and sanctions dont work against Russia, why America and all western countries dont understand it, you had 8 long yers to realize it"}, {"user_id": "e51aebdf4496", "comment_time": 1645898238266, "comment": "I saw a variant of this on the unoffical LGB Alliance facebook with a butch olive russian tank, vs a US pink they/them tank, and I don't know how these people lost their collective minds so hard."}, {"user_id": "5c1e1e98ba73", "comment_time": 1645947081011, "comment": "Well, I speak fluent Russian and Ukrainian, and assure you that there has been not one word about anything gender related in any of the Russian or Ukrainian media since the beginning of this war.

It\u2019s standard protocol for any organization dedicated to fighting abuse. Domestic violence hotlines don\u2019t go telling abusive spouses that the abused partner is seeking outside assistance. Same with teen hotlines. It\u2019s common sense.\nBut to modern day reactionary conservatives, this is an outrage. They claim this is dangerous and constitutes \u201cgrooming.\u201d It\u2019s a gross distortion of reality meant to drive outrage and clicks.\nThe Trevor Project was founded in the run up to the release of the film \u201cTrevor\u201d on HBO in 1998. The film told the story of a 13 year old gay boy who struggles with suicidal thoughts and filmmakers wanted to include a resource for teens who may find themselves in a similar situation.\nBut upon investigation, they realized that no such resource existed. This was just 24 years ago. So they set up their own, establishing the Trevor Lifeline before the film\u2019s air date.\nNow two and a half decades later, conservatives are suddenly on the attack against the organization. And it\u2019s driven by transphobia. Conservatives have come to believe that any affirmation of the identities of trans kids is akin to pedophilia and \u201cgrooming.\u201d They got to that point by believing a whole collection of other increasingly sinister conspiracy theories about trans people over the years.\nIt\u2019s getting quite dangerous to be trans or even be a trans ally in the US and the UK. The rhetoric has gotten to the point where a bombing of a youth gender clinic wouldn\u2019t surprise me at all.

I could find a two bedroom place for the rent on my current one bedroom in greater DC.\nBut over time, the rents up north have been steadily going up.

How can anyone afford multi-thousand dollar rents on the meager wages American workers are paid?\nThe last few years have seen modest gains in employee wages, but landlords in the US have doubled and sometimes even tripled the average rent in their areas over that same time period. What the hell are landlords spending money on that they need to boost rents so high? Maybe they should try getting a job, or selling some assets if they can\u2019t afford it.\nUltimately however, the problem is there\u2019s not enough rental stock in this country.

It\u2019s always a risk to be on the road with unrest looming, but one should never turn down a chance to travel to the Arctic. And nothing suggested that the rallies would be anything other than uneventful.\nThat proved terribly wrong. Tens of thousands poured into the streets\u2014many of them young people who had never protested before. They had been drawn out in part by a video investigation that Mr Navalny released on Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev\u2019s allegedly lavish lifestyle. (Rubber ducks became a symbol of the protests, as he reportedly kept a house for ducks at one of his estates.) At subsequent rallies in the ensuing months, fresh faces continued to dominate the crowds. The Kremlin clearly noticed: Vladimir Putin began appearing at events with pro-government youth groups. Whether talking with Kremlin consultants, opposition leaders or political analysts, conversations kept turning to the mythical molodezh \u2014 the youth.\n\n\nYoung protesters at opposition rallies in Moscow, 2017\nAs the chattering class made sweeping statements about Russia\u2019s young people and what they want, I began to wonder how much any of us sitting in Moscow could really know. To what extent did the kids we were seeing on the streets represent a larger movement? What did their peers who weren\u2019t protesting think?\nAhead of Russia\u2019s presidential elections on March 18th, I decided to set out and talk to young people across Russia to find out more about how they saw the world and their lives. Sociological data can provide invaluable insights into broader trends, but there is no substitute for extended time spent talking to people first hand. I decided to focus on 18 year-olds \u2014 those born the year Mr Putin first came to power. They will all have spent their entire lives in Putin\u2019s Russia, and will be eligible to vote for the first time this year. By gathering enough voices, I hoped to create a collective portrait of a generation, where the parts would add up to a whole like a mosaic.\nI teamed up with Davide Monteleone, an Italian photographer based in Moscow. To find our heroes, we turned mainly to social media. The vast majority of young Russians are regular users of VKontakte, a Russian-language Facebook clone. We found that VK had a handy (though slightly creepy) feature: it allowed us to reverse search for users by birthdate. Want to find the profiles of everyone born in January, 2000 in Moscow? Pozhaluysta.\nWe began sending out mass messages to users in a list of about ten cities. (We were limited to 20 messages per day from a single account to avoid getting blocked by spam filters.) We introduced ourselves as journalists working on a documentary project about Russian youth, and asked if they would be interested in participating when we visited their city. (The pitch to these teenagers was helped considerably by the chance to come away with a portrait shot taken by Davide.) We put out targeted advertisements in those same cities. Many people ignored us entirely; some blocked us; one responded with a curt all-caps \u201cNO THANKS\u201d.\n\n\n\nYet in the span of a couple weeks, we had also racked up more than 150 positive responses. Many were keen to hear more about our project, and ultimately to meet and chat with these two guys who randomly wrote to them online. This struck me as an encouraging sign of basic openness and trust.\nAs we whittled the candidates down, we strove to capture a cross-section of the country as best we could. Time and budgetary constraints meant that we could travel to four cities at most. Moscow, the capital, and by far Russia\u2019s most powerful and populous city, could not be skipped. For a flavour of the Far North, we went to Murmansk, a gritty port city on the Barents Sea. To capture a bit of Russia\u2019s oft-overlooked ethnic diversity, we headed to Dagestan, a majority-Muslim republic in the North Caucasus where Davide and I have both reported in the past. (Our social media outreach was less successful in the region, so having strong local connections proved especially important.) And what would a portrait of Russia be without Siberia? Novosibirsk called.\nWith names, numbers and social media profiles in hand, we set off. We developed a standardised set of questions, covering everything from gender relations to politics to the existence of God. I sprinkled in some questions pulled from those asked by sociologists at the Levada Centre, Russia\u2019s best independent polling outfit. That would allow us to place the random individuals we met into the broader context of Russian society.\nBy the time we finished reporting, we had interviewed 25 people. Our Dropboxes were overflowing with hours and hours of audio recordings, as well as Davide\u2019s brilliant portraits, and one of me, that Dmitry Fedorov, a kind guy with a talented eye, had sketched from a photograph on my Facebook profile. (Meta, right?)\n\nWe set out to make portraits of others, but also came back with one of myself\nAs with any large project, the final product was the fruit of a collective labor. Davide\u2019s portraits brought the subjects to life. Our talented designers and programmers in London built a web page from scratch to host the material. Our social-media whizzes whipped up versions of the story for The Economist\u2019s Snapchat and Instagram accounts. The Levada Centre kindly provided us with detailed survey data broken down by age cohort, which our data team turned into a neat set of charts. A number of colleagues at our offices in London and Moscow provided invaluable feedback on the interview texts. In the end, the challenge lay not in finding enough compelling stories, as we initially feared, but in deciding which twelve compelling stories to include.\nNoah Sneider is Moscow correspondent at The Economist.

It was Vladimir Putin beginning to articulate his answer to the vexed eternal question: \u2018What does it mean to be Russian?\u2019\nPROLOGUE\nPrince Vladimir cut a tortured path to power. It all began when militant nomads murdered his father, Svyatoslav, on the banks of a river south of Kiev. Legend has it that those warriors made a gold-plated goblet of Svyatoslav\u2019s skull and then drank from it. Vladimir, in turn, consolidated control over the kingdom by battling his brother. Their war ended when Vladimir called a meeting and had his goons greet his guest with two swords to the chest. The prince regretted it, but, he said, \u201cIt was not I who began to fight with my brother, but he, and I was for that reason overcome by fear, and therefore have come out against him.\u201d\nHe proceeded to impregnate his brother\u2019s wife, and took to ruling Kiev alone. He was \u201cinsatiable in vice,\u201d with five brides and 800 concubines. Outside his castle, he erected an idol to Perun, God of Thunder. The idol\u2019s body was wood, its head silver, and its mustache gold. Vladimir\u2019s subjects sacrificed their sons and daughters at its feet. Thus emerged the ancient kingdom of Kievan Rus, progenitor of the eastern Slavic world, origin of Russia and Ukraine, and wellspring of present-day strife.\nI want to tell you a story about Ukraine, but it\u2019s not really about what\u2019s happening in Ukraine now, not really about soldiers and seizures and referendums. The cold calculus of geopolitics is secondary here. This \u2014 the precipice that the world is teetering on \u2014 is about identity and memory and deep, deep history. This is a story about the Russian Empire.\nIn late February, I set out for Ukraine from my home in Moscow. I rode a nearly empty night train, a string of blue carriages with yellow stripes. Frost tinted the windows and the picture outside seemed an endless repeating loop of birches and barren fields. The former Ukrainian president, Viktor Yanukovych, had just fled his gaudy palace following months of protests.\nIn the Kiev city center, thousands had been gathering since last November. They built a tent camp and lived on the barricades, bearing winter frost and feeding each other borscht in plastic bowls. The movement came to be known as \u201cMaidan,\u201d or \u201cEuromaidan,\u201d for the square it grew on and the ambitions it harbored. The nominal cause of the unrest was Yanukovych\u2019s decision not to sign a trade agreement to move Ukraine closer to the European Union, but to turn, instead, to Mother Russia. Fierce clashes between student protestors and Ukraine\u2019s special police, the Berkut, soon galvanized a wider population, and Maidan become one of those misguided synonyms \u2014 like Tahrir and Gezi \u2014 for freedom, democracy, and the better life. It all culminated in late February, when Yanukovych unleashed snipers onto the streets, hoping to retain his tenuous grip. More than a hundred protestors died, and Yanukovych disappeared.\nWhile the demonstrations achieved their goal of deposing the reviled ruler (he took refuge in Russia), the upheaval that followed has imperiled Ukraine\u2019s very existence and deeply shaken the international order. Russia annexed Crimea and has been sowing chaos throughout eastern Ukraine ever since. This sudden aggression stunned the West, calling wider European security into doubt. Meanwhile, Ukraine itself descended into a bloody war. Perhaps most frightening of all, the story continues: Russia and the West are no closer to compromise, let alone understanding, and violence still rages in eastern Ukraine, where more than 3,700 people have died since late April, including 298 innocent passengers on Malaysia Airlines Flight 17.\nYet as I witnessed these events unfold while reporting on the crisis, I found myself slipping backwards in time, seeking explanations for the current chaos in the shady recesses of history.\nLenin in Kharkiv, February 2014. Photo by Noah Sneider\nI arrived first in Kharkiv, Ukraine\u2019s second-largest city, near the eastern border with Russia. Two groups stood guard there on the city\u2019s main square, a teardrop-shaped stretch of forced grandeur. One had a makeshift tent camp around the central statue of Lenin, where they stood guard at his stone feet. On the fences they hung signs: \u201cFascists: Don\u2019t test Kharkiv\u2019s patience,\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t need NATO,\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t tear down monuments!\u201d Under the influence of a noxious Russian propaganda campaign, this group saw the revolution in Kiev as a fascist-led coup bent on oppressing Ukraine\u2019s mostly Russian-speaking eastern population, delivering Russian holy sites into NATO\u2019s hands, and destroying virtually everything they held dear, even if they themselves could not identify what, exactly, was so dear.\nThough this picture bears little resemblance to reality, it contains just enough streaks of truth to have great power, like a nightmare full of familiar faces. Far-right nationalist groups did play a crucial role on the Maidan (though they do not, as Russian television loves to claim, control Ukraine). American and European officials, such as Victoria Nuland, John McCain, and Catherine Ashton, did make stunningly tactless appearances at the protests (though the West did not finance the entire enterprise, contrary to popular Russian opinion). The new post-revolutionary government did, in a moment of extraordinary idiocy, pass a law stripping Russian of its status as an official language (though the move was ultimately vetoed). And tearing down Soviet statues did become a symbolic act in Ukraine (including, much later, this very one in Kharkiv).\nAcross the square, another crew \u2014 this one representing the Maidan movement \u2014 occupied the regional administration building, hoping to keep the city from slipping into pro-Russian hands while the state reassembled itself in Kiev. They donned blue and yellow ski masks and built barricades of their own. \u201cThey need to study history,\u201d Pytor, a retired factory worker, said of the Lenin-statue defenders across the way. \u201cAnd not just the propaganda.\u201d Vlad, sitting nearby and eating ramen from a clear plastic cup, went further: \u201cUkraine lived under occupation until 1991. The monument means nothing to us.\u201d Many inside the building saw themselves as part of a historic transformation: from a Russian vassal into a truly independent nation.\nCaught between the two sides were the many Ukrainians with no interest in another political squabble. \u201cAll our politicians are thieves,\u201d one young mother told me as she cooed at the baby in her stroller and shuffled across the square. And then, more tragically, were those who could not possibly choose sides, those with mixed blood and dual allegiances, those who thought they lived in a happy family.\nAs Dmitry Furman, a noted scholar, wrote back in 1997, \u201cRussian-Ukrainian problems are not concrete and rational problems\u2026 What kind of fights can there be between brothers?\u2026 What is it that divides Ukrainian and Russian brothers when they \u2018recall\u2019 that they are separate peoples? It is the same stuff that normally divides brothers \u2014 the struggle over parents, primogeniture, legacy.\u201d\nFights between brothers can be the most brutal fights of all, especially when those brothers share a deep and disputed history.\nI. CRIMEA\nA Region Changes Hands. Again.\nFrom Kharkiv, a night train carried me down across the darkened steppe to Crimea, where late winter fog filled the skies. When I arrived, I was still in Ukraine. By the time I was ready to leave, some three weeks later, I was (de facto) in Russia.\nCrimea is a peninsula that juts south into the Black Sea. Ancient vineyards line its rolling hills and jagged juniper trees hang off its coasts. Traces of the Soviet \u2014 dilapidated homes, boxy buildings, monuments to labor \u2014 punctuate an otherwise beautiful landscape, one comparable in stretches to the better-known rivieras of Italy or France. Further inland, though, bleak grasslands and swampy isthmuses link Crimea to Ukraine. Sitting on a civilizational fault line, the region has attracted a murderer\u2019s row of empires, belonging at various times to the Greeks, Romans, Byzantines, Ottomans, and Russians.\nFor Russia the Crimean question is one of origins. In the twenty-three years since the Soviet Union collapsed, Russia has been struggling to identify a new national idea: What does it mean to be Russian? To be Russian now, absent tsarism or communism? What recent events make clear is that for Russia, empire is an existential yearning. Russia cannot be merely a country; it must control others in order to validate its sense of grandeur. And at the heart of this Russian imperial project lies Ukraine.\nRussia\u2019s existence traces back to the Dark Ages when pagan princes roamed these lands. The memory is far from dead. When President Vladimir Putin announced his decision to annex Crimea, altering Europe\u2019s borders and imperiling the idea of state sovereignty, he gave one of the most important speeches of his political life \u2014 a \u201cPutin Doctrine\u201d for Eurasia \u2014 and laid out an ideology based on protecting ethnic Russians wherever they may be. His justification for taking Crimea began with a reference to 1,100 year-old history: \u201cEverything in Crimea speaks of our shared history and pride. This is the location of ancient Khersones, where Prince Vladimir was baptized. His spiritual feat of adopting Orthodoxy predetermined the overall basis of the culture, civilization, and human values that unite the peoples of Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus.\u201d\nPrince Vladimir\u2019s \u201cspiritual feat\u201d began in 986, when a procession of guests came to Kiev to proselytize the world\u2019s major religions. First came the Muslim Bulgars. The Muslims demanded circumcision and abstinence from pork and wine in this life in exchange for \u201ccomplete fulfillment of carnal desires\u201d in the next. Vladimir rebuffed their offer: \u201cDrinking is the joy of the Russes. We cannot exist without that pleasure.\u201d The Germans arrived next, preaching the teachings of the pope, but to no avail. Then the Jews. They too were turned down. Vladimir saw the loss of Jerusalem as evidence of God\u2019s abandonment: \u201cIf God loved you and your faith, you would not be thus dispersed in foreign lands. Do you expect us to accept that fate also?\u201d\nBaptism of Prince Vladimir (Viktor Vasnetsov, via WikiArt)\nFinally a Greek scholar arrived and enraptured Vladimir, telling the history of the world from creation to its present day. When the Prince\u2019s scouts later returned from Greece, they told tales of Orthodox glory: \u201cOn earth there is no such splendor or such beauty, and we are at a loss how to describe it. We only know that God dwells there among men, and their service is fairer than the ceremonies of other nations. For we cannot forget that beauty. Every man, after tasting something sweet, is afterward unwilling to accept that which is bitter, and therefore we cannot dwell longer here.\u201d In 988, Vladimir was baptized and married the Byzantine Emperor Basil\u2019s sister, Anna, in a church in a Greek town called Khersones on the southwest coast of what we call Crimea.\nSouth of Sevastopol, not far from what\u2019s left of Khersones, Russian and Ukrainian military bases dotted the hills this spring. Sometimes their walls nearly intersected; sometimes you could see old Russian license plates behind Ukrainian gates. Before, it did not matter \u2014 they were all of one strain.\nUntil they were not. I met this Colonel named Laptev at one of the Ukrainian spots in early March. His post had been surrounded by Russian forces for days. A green KAMAZ transport truck idled outside the entrance and several guys in fatigues and masks meandered, looking bored, with AKs slung across their shoulders. They did not answer questions but did let us through their checkpoint to see Laptev. He, in turn, led us through the halls, pointing to overturned cabinets as signs of \u201cfull blockade position.\u201d He sat us down in his office \u2014 a narrow room with a single bed and a dilapidated desk \u2014 and began briefing as if it was real, as if all of this was really happening. Well, he said, we\u2019ve got some dynamite ready. He fished out a backpack \u2014 it could\u2019ve been the faded Jansport I wore to the first grade \u2014 and revealed a stack of explosives. We\u2019re ready, he said. See? Look \u2014 and here his voice dropped into a near whisper: \u201cWhy?\u201d No one ever thought it could come to this, no one ever thought Ukraine would be poised to fight Russia. \u201cWhy would our brothers do this?\u201d\nIt\u2019s worth remembering that these brothers have been fighting since before they were born. These are twins who played hangman with their umbilical cords in the womb. Just as Prince Vladimir rose amidst fratricidal struggle, so too did his son, Yaroslav, the second sovereign of Rus. He came down from his base of power in Novgorod (some 300 miles north of what is now Moscow) to take control over the kingdom from his half-brother Sviatopolk, who had himself already murdered three other brothers. With the help of Viking mercenaries, Yaroslav first entered Kiev in 1016 during a dawn battle on the shores of a frozen lake. Sviatopolk fled to Poland, steam rising, I imagine, from the splintering ice.\nUnder Yaroslav\u2019s rule, Kievan Rus reached its zenith, stretching from the White Sea to the Black. He brought things like books and churches to Kiev, built the famed St. Sophia Cathedral, and established the early trappings of a modern civilization. The people called him Yaroslav the Wise. He strengthened ties with European powers in every direction, marrying relatives off to royalty from Poland, Hungary, Norway, France, and the Roman and Byzantine Empires. Some historians call him \u201cthe Father-in-Law of Europe.\u201d He founded cities in four different modern-day countries: Poland, Estonia, Russia, and Ukraine. His image now graces both Ukraine\u2019s 2-Hrivnya note and Russia\u2019s 1,000-Ruble bill.\nThe two incarnations of Yaroslav the Wise: Russia\u2019s 1,000-ruble bill (left) and Ukraine\u2019s 2-hrivnya note (right)\nOn his deathbed, Yaroslav exhorted his sons to behave: \u201cLove one another, since ye are brothers by one father and mother. If ye abide in amity with one another, God will dwell among you, and will subject your enemies to you, and ye will live at peace. But if ye dwell in envy and dissension, quarreling with one another, then ye will perish yourselves and bring to ruin the land of your ancestors, which they won at the price of great effort.\u201d\nHe died in 1054, his body laid to rest in a sarcophagus of white stone.\nNearly 1,000 years later, I came to the Livadia Palace, perched on a cliffside in Yalta, on the southern coast of Crimea, where the big three powers divided the world after World War II. It too is wrought of white stone, and it too could be called a royal sarcophagus, for in the palace\u2019s cavernous foyer we found three great leaders: Roosevelt sitting on the left in a charcoal grey suit, one hand open, reaching for something; Churchill on the right in an officer\u2019s outfit, one fist clenched; and Stalin in the center holding a tobacco pipe, his thick cockroach mustache covering his upper lip. They were just wax figures, but they gave the sensation that the building somehow housed great secrets, that the floors, by virtue of proximity to history, somehow knew.\nOur young tour guide wore black leggings and a fur vest over a sweater with a reindeer motif. She called herself Ekaterina, and her smile never drooped. She told us about how the palace had been the last tsar\u2019s summer home, and about how the \u201cBig Three\u201d had carved up Europe in these halls. She told us about how they gave limp Roosevelt the Tsar\u2019s old first-floor study to sleep in, and about how Stalin himself came to Yalta by train through Ukraine.\nWhen she mentioned that Roosevelt died two months after the fateful conference, one older Russian tourist interrupted: \u201cDied? I think you mean he was killed.\u201d\n\u201cNo, he died,\u201d Ekaterina said, smile still in place. \u201cHe was in poor health, he spent twenty years paralyzed in a wheelchair.\u201d\n\u201cNo. He was killed.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I haven\u2019t heard that version.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a version, it\u2019s been proven. It is pravda.\u201d\nThis was not the last argument we\u2019d hear in Ukraine about history and truth. It wasn\u2019t even the last such argument we\u2019d hear that day.\nLater in the afternoon we ducked into a courtyard off the city\u2019s palm-tree lined promenade and paid a visit to the history faculty at the Crimean University of the Humanities. We sat in a circle on cold chairs.\n\u201cIf the current Russian president\u2019s plans include reviving the Russian empire,\u201d one particularly ominous monologue began, \u201cif they include reviving the greatness of the state, and creating some sort of conglomerate by using the Soviet and imperial heritage, then in this game Crimea, firstly, plays a crucial role. And secondly, Ukraine plays a crucial role. For the question about Ukraine is a question about the roots, the historical roots, of the Russian empire.\u201d\nPro-Russian protestors rally in the center of Simferopol, Crimea. Photo by Noah Sneider\nThey explained how the Soviet empire had been built on the ashes of the imperial empire, and the imperial empire in turn on the ashes of Kievan Rus. They explained how Russian thinkers put forth the idea that all the eastern Slavic peoples \u2014 Russians, Ukrainians, and Belorussians \u2014 descend from the same common Kievan core. And they explained how that idea has been used to prop up Russia\u2019s imperial claims for centuries.\n\u201cI\u2019m almost certain that for the current Russian leadership, Ukraine remains a \u2018geographic novelty,\u2019\u201d said a dark-haired docent, Marina Budzar. \u201cFor them, Ukraine is a state that exists only nominally: Either it shouldn\u2019t exist at all, or it should exist only as a satellite\u2026\u201d\nRussia sees Kievan Rus as the direct predecessor of a wider \u201cRussian world.\u201d In this version of history, White Russia (Belarus), Little Russia (Ukraine), and Great Russia (Russia itself) are all derivatives of the same Russian narod (people). In this version, the collapse of the Soviet Union is a tragedy, President Vladimir is the true heir to Prince Vladimir, and Ukrainian independence is a historical accident.\nLike a brother with a far different slant on the family story, modern Ukraine also claims the Kievan legacy as its own. Its coat of arms \u2014 a trident \u2014 comes from Vladimir\u2019s old seal. And Vladimir himself (or Volodymyr, as he is known in Ukraine), with flowing hair and wavy beard, decorates Ukraine\u2019s 1-Hrivnya bill. In Ukraine\u2019s new historiography, 1991 is the summit of a millennia-long climb toward an independent state.\nThe man who started it all: Prince Vladimir, or Volodymyr, as seen on Ukraine\u2019s 1-hrivnya note\nThese clashing interpretations of history, and the disparate worldviews they engender, underpin today\u2019s bloodshed. Which version is factually true is less important than how they have been used by the countries\u2019 elites. While nations may be imagined communities, they are palpably real to the people whose lives they govern, and to those who govern lives.\nAs Putin himself famously told George W. Bush back in 2008, \u201cYou have to understand, George, that Ukraine is not even a country.\u201d In his Crimea annexation speech this year, he went further, declaring that Ukraine and Russia \u201care one people. Kiev is the mother of Russian cities. Ancient Rus is our common source and we cannot live without each other.\u201d\nIf I had been at home while Crimea unraveled, I might have watched Jon Stewart. He did a bit, which I saw later, called \u201cCrimean War 2: Ukrainian Boogaloo.\u201d His guest was Kimberly Marten, a professor of Russian politics from Barnard. Their discussion encapsulated, albeit in simplistic terms, the typical American reaction to Russia\u2019s seizure of Crimea:\nMarten: \u201cNo one can figure out why he [Putin] has taken such big risks for such little gain.\u201d\nStewart: \u201cWhat I don\u2019t understand about this on a purely economic level is, Russia has benefited so greatly from this trade relationship with Europe. And Europe now uses their natural resources and is in some way dependent on it, maybe in a way that we were with the Middle East. Why would they jeopardize this for what appears to be\u2026 I just don\u2019t understand what it is that they\u2019re looking for from Crimea.\u201d\nMarten: \u201cI don\u2019t understand it either. They\u2019re acting as if it\u2019s still the 19th century and grabbing land matters.\u201d\nThe thing is, it\u2019s not just any land. And human nature hasn\u2019t changed that much since the 19th century.\nI do not mean to suggest that history explains everything that\u2019s happening now, or that it holds the key to stopping the current violence. Certainly the average citizens of Simferopol, Donetsk, Kiev, or Moscow don\u2019t ponder the Primary Chronicle, the Rus\u2019 foundational text, while sipping tea.\nBut tapping into historical currents can give political movements great, and, at times, explosive, power. Just as the Sunni-Shiite split some 1,500 years ago still has profound implications for the modern world, so too does eastern Europe\u2019s past shape its contemporary contours. Today\u2019s crisis is not new. It is but one point on a long line, and we ignore this history at our peril.\nUkraine\u2019s is a fundamentally fractured past. It is a nation forged of two halves, two cultures, two identities. These currents run all the way back to the fall of Kievan Rus. After Yaroslav\u2019s sons sealed him in his white sarcophagus in the 11th century, the brothers began fighting again. The consequences were visible in the sky, where night after night, legend has it, one could see a massive star with \u201cbloody rays.\u201d\n\u201cThus portents in the sky, or in the stars, or in the sun, or such as are made known by birds or from some other source, are not favorable import,\u201d reads the Primary Chronicle. \u201cSuch signs are, on the contrary, of evil significance, presaging the appearance of war, famine, or death.\u201d\nAs the brothers battled, the kingdom crumbled. Local power centers arose across the lands, including the Galicia-Volhynia Principality to the west of Kiev, and, to the east, the Vladimir-Suzdal Principality, which happened to include a backwater trading post called Muscovy. The eastern principalities in modern-day Russia came under Mongol control \u2014 the so-called \u201cTatar Yoke.\u201d\nIn early September of 1380, Prince Dmitry of Moscow made the first attempt to \u201cthrow off\u201d the Tatar Yoke, leading his forces across a foggy field known as Kulikovo.\nThe battle unified the Slavs of the region, and solidified Moscow\u2019s place as the new center of the so-called \u201cRussian Lands.\u201d As an ancient Russian epic, Zadonschina, tells, \u201cAll over the Russian land there spread joy and merriment: the Russian glory was borne through the land\u2026.\u201d Just over one hundred years later, Prince Ivan III defeated the Mongols once and for all. He married Sophia, niece of the last Byzantine emperor, and they began conceiving of Moscow as the Third Rome. He began to call himself Tsar.\nWhen Putin came to power in 2000, he returned to the theme, writing a manifesto in which he named \u201cbelief in the greatness of Russia\u201d one of the core Russian values. This sense of pride drove events in Crimea ahead of the annexation too. I encountered it on the streets and in homes, on billboards and on faces, young and old.\nOnce, colleagues and I traveled to Crimea\u2019s far western coast, where we\u2019d heard that the Russians had seized a military base and a border control point. Our first attempt at finding these sites led us up a godforsaken dirt road, which ended at an abandoned Soviet-era lighthouse perched on spectacular cliffs. We paused, we admired the beauty, we threw stones into the sea. Below, we could see frothy tide pools, filling and emptying, emptying and filling, like memory.\nEventually we found an officer who led us to his base, or, more accurately, his former base. Soldiers roamed just inside the gates, but they were not Ukrainian. Instead we saw men in unmarked green camouflage, with black boots and new black rifles. These were Russian soldiers, though at the time, Russia vehemently denied their existence. They became known as \u201clittle green men.\u201d In the weeks leading up to the Crimean referendum, these troops surrounded and captured Ukrainian military bases across the peninsula, often without firing a shot.\nThe infamous \u2018little green men\u2019 stand guard outside a Ukrainian base at Perevalnoye, Crimea. Photo by Noah Sneider\nAt this particular base, some 200 or so heavy armed little green men scaled the walls as dawn broke, overwhelming the forty to fifty lightly armed Ukrainian sailors inside. As we tried to talk to the little green men that day, one Ukrainian sailor stumbled, visibly drunk, up the gates, which still bore the Ukrainian coat of arms, Volodymyr\u2019s blue and yellow trident. \u201cI serve here,\u201d he slurred. The little green men laughed.\nA crew of pro-Russian civilians shoved the drunken soldier away from the base, and we took our cue to leave. We wanted to interview the Ukrainian officer somewhere quieter, so he brought us to a caf\u00e9, which, we would discover too late, was called the \u2018Officers\u2019 Club\u2019 and served as a hangout for local law enforcement. That was where we met a man we came to call Thumbcuffs, who said, loudly, \u201cARE YOU FOR RUSSIA?!?\u201d\nWe said we were journalists; we weren\u2019t for anyone. He did not look pleased. He spun the thumbcuffs he carried slowly around each of his fingers as he talked. The man we were interviewing stared at the ground, eyes empty. Thumbcuffs asked again: \u201cARE YOU FOR RUSSIA?!?\u201d\nThumbcuffs told us to get up. In the doorway to the caf\u00e9, roughly twenty guys had gathered \u2014 a mixture of policemen, camouflaged civilians, and masked mysteries. A handful had pistols holstered at their sides, and they shouted over one another, each expressing his own idiosyncratic strain of outrage. It took fifteen minutes for the anger to subside. They left us with a warning: \u201cThis is not your problem, Americans. Get out and never come back.\u201d\nI am reminded here of a Pushkin poem, one he wrote in response to Western criticism of Russia for invading Poland in 1831. He invoked the long history of inter-Slavic conflict:\n\u201cWhat are you sounding off about, you foreign tub-thumpers?\nWhy do you threaten Russia with anathema?\nDesist: This is a battle of Slavs amongst themselves,\na domestic, ancient quarrel, already weighed by fate.\nAn issue you will not resolve\u2026\nLeave us alone, you haven\u2019t read\nThese bloody scrolls.\nTo you it\u2019s unintelligible, to you it\u2019s alien,\nThis family feud.\u201d\nHe asked, \u201cWill the Slavonic streams converge in the Russian sea?\u201d\nThe \u201cSlavonic streams\u201d had in fact cleaved and converged and cleaved again over the course of many centuries. After Yaroslav, the western principalities, containing much of modern-day Ukraine, ended up in the hands of Lithuanian and Polish royalty. Coming under their rule opened a corridor for Renaissance-era European thought to enter the eastern Slavic lands. Yet some Orthodox descendants of Prince Vladimir chafed under Catholic rule and Polish serfdom. These men called themselves Cossacks. One of them, Bohdan Khmelnytsky harnessed his restless clansmen in 1648 and led a revolt. He founded the short-lived state known as the Hetmanate, a proto-Ukraine (Khmelnytsky now graces Ukraine\u2019s 5 Hrivnya bill). He declared himself \u201cthe sole autocrat of Rus.\u201d\nBohdan Khmelnytsky, founder of the Hetmanate, on Ukraine\u2019s 5-hrivnya note\nThen, like the trunks of two trees growing side by side in the same soil the fates of the two split Rus nations fused. Khmelnytsky\u2019s budding Hetmanate needed a new ally to fend off the vengeful Poles. And the leaders of the new Russian dynasty, the Romanovs, saw in an alliance a chance to expand further, to regain lands they considered historically theirs.\nSo in 1654, the Cossacks gathered in a city just outside Kiev, and a council of mustachioed warriors listened as Bohdan extolled the virtues of Russian protection. They reached the Treaty of Pereyaslav, an agreement that fundamentally altered the contours of Europe for centuries to come. Khmelnytsky may have intended to form a simple military alliance. Instead, he signed the nascent Ukrainian nation away to Russia, and inaugurated a period of westward imperial expansion that began with the Russian conquest of Poland in the 18th century, brought the Tsar\u2019s troops all the way to Paris in the 19th, and ended with Red Army soldiers in Berlin in the 20th.\nFor Russian rulers, the Treaty of Pereyaslav is seen as a grand moment, the healing of broken earth. The Soviets celebrated 1954 as the \u201c300th Anniversary of the Reunification of Ukraine and Russia.\u201d Folk ensembles danced through the streets of Moscow, and Premier Nikita Khrushchev made the fateful decision to give Ukraine a \u201cgift\u201d: Crimea.\nSoviet stamp in honor of the Treaty of Pereyeslav and the \u201c300th Anniversary of the Reunion of Ukraine and Russia\u201d (via wikipedia.ru)\nSome Ukrainians, however, consider the treaty a grave tragedy, the source of centuries-long subordination. It was not long before a new Hetmanate leader, Ivan Mazepa, the Polish-educated son of a Cossack chieftain, attempted to change course. When King Charles of Sweden attacked Russia in 1708, sending cavalry down from the north, Mazepa seized what he saw as chance at independence, and turned on the Tsar to join the invaders.\nThe two armies met in the hills of central Ukraine, in a town called Poltava. On a late June morning, some 80,000 Russian forces overwhelmed the 20,000 outmatched Swedes, sending Charles and Mazepa fleeing. The battle left the Swedish Kingdom in tatters and marked the debut of a new superpower on the European stage: the Russian Empire.\nMazepa, in turn, became one of the Slavic world\u2019s most controversial characters. He was a darling of later Ukrainian nationalists, Russian Decembrists, and European Romantics, inspiring even Lord Byron.\nFor the Tsar, though, Mazepa was the ultimate blood traitor. The Russian Orthodox Church excommunicated him, and for years at services commemorating the battle of Poltava, Mazepa was cursed. Pushkin, Russia\u2019s preeminent poet, wrote his own imperialist-tinged response to Byron, turning the tragic hero into a historic turncoat. To this day, politicians in Russia and Ukraine invoke his name as a proxy for nationalist intrigues.\nIn 2009, for example, Ukrainian President Viktor Yuschenko (the hero of Ukraine\u2019s previous pro-Western revolution) spoke out in favor of rehabilitating Mazepa\u2019s name, laying flowers at a monument to the fallen Cossack hero during festivities marking the 300-year anniversary of events at Poltava. Yuschenko announced plans for a Mazepa military medal, and said of Mazepa\u2019s rein, \u201cUkraine was reviving as the country of European cultural traditions.\u201d\nIn response, a leading Russian diplomat called the celebration \u201cabsurd.\u201d Russia\u2019s foreign ministry saw fit to get involved, releasing a statement admonishing Ukrainian leaders for tampering with a carefully calibrated narrative:\n\u201cWe would like to remind the Ukrainian leadership that games with history, especially with nationalist undertones, has never led to anything good. By attempting to rewrite the joint Russian-Ukrainian history, the Ukrainian authorities are not so much uniting Ukrainian society as they are dividing it.\u201d\nRussian demonstrators burned Mazepa\u2019s effigy. In downtown Simferopol, protestors showed up with Russian flags, portraits of Putin and posters reading: \u201cEternal shame on the sickly Judas \u2014 Ivashka Mazepa and his followers!\u201d and \u201cUkraine\u2019s future is in alliance with Russia.\u201d They also had a big printout of Ukraine\u2019s 10 hrivyna bill, which features Mazepa\u2019s face. The protestors pelted it with eggs and smeared it with manure.\nA controversial hero, Ivan Mazepa, on Ukraine\u2019s 10-hrivnya bill\nLater that year, Ukraine\u2019s former ambassador to the United States, Yuriy Scherbak, penned a column analyzing Russia\u2019s new neo-imperial discourse, calling it \u201cideological-propagandistic support for a future operation to capture the territory of a sovereign state.\u201d Few in the West listened.\nSpray painting Soviet flags in Crimea. Photo by Noah Sneider\nRoughly five years after these events, I stood in downtown Simferopol, in the shadow of a gold-domed church and a WWII memorial, where I found people holding Russian flags and hanging a homemade poster on the base of a retired tank: \u201cHands off our history! Our memory! Our pride!\u201d In the center of the crowd, they were spray-painting silver hammers-and-sickles onto red flags. A diminutive older woman, Lyudmila, led the operation, laying out the backdrops and admonishing the younger men around her: \u201cSpray! Spray faster! Don\u2019t dawdle!\u201d She had on white gloves, a red headband over her white hair, and a red and white \u201cRUSSIA\u201d tracksuit made by Bosco (official clothing provider of Sochi 2014). She looked like a mascot for the Babushka All-Stars. \u201cToday is a historic day, a historic day,\u201d she told me, before yelling at a Cossack for missing a spot.\nThe money behind it all (as I heard often during those weeks, \u201cthere is always money behind it all\u201d) turned out to be a slick local politician from the city of Kursk in Crimea\u2019s neighboring Russian region of Krasnodar. He stood out in a neatly pressed suit, and handed out glossy fliers with a letter to the people. It read, in part, like this:\n\u201cResidents of multiethnic Crimea!\nUkrainians, Tatars, Crimean Tatars, Armenians, Jews, Russians, and many others!\nIn the distant Soviet times, there were not divisions based on nationality, we were all brothers!\nTime passed and divided us into different governments, but we, Russians, still believe and will believe that no matter what, we are one whole, we are one big family!\u2026 And if you ask for our help, we will fulfill our brotherly duty and help you!\nRussians do not abandon their own!\u201d\nThe next day, March 15th, one day before Crimea\u2019s secession referendum, a collection of mostly middle-aged men gathered outside the local chapter of the Afghan Veteran\u2019s Union. They wanted to become citizen election monitors. They wore dark jackets and red armbands, and took orders from a graying man with a clipboard. They did not care what exactly post-Ukraine life would bring, as long as they became Russia (again). \u201cIt\u2019s not important that you have light if you\u2019re going home to your mother,\u201d said a portly man named Igor Trushko. \u201cIf you\u2019ve been out in Africa in the desert for ten years and you\u2019re going home, you don\u2019t care whether there will be light. You\u2019re going home.\u201d\nAnd so, Trushko and many of his comrades reveled the following night, when the \u201cvote\u201d came in at 97%. A crowd gathered around Lenin in the center of Simferopol, where they danced and drank and yelled: RO-SI-YA! A green laser show flashed a message onto the surrounding buildings: THE RUSSIAN SPRING.\nII. MOSCOW\nThe Rise of Vladimir the Uniter\n\u201cIf you compress a spring all the way to its limit, it will snap back hard.\u201d\n\u2013 Vladimir Putin\nThe Moscow I returned to after a month in Ukraine had also changed. It was still Russia, of course, only more bellicose and more triumphant. The \u201cgreat victory\u201d in Crimea had activated in Russians a dormant but still potent patriotism. Conversations, even with the Putin-hating liberal intelligentsia, suddenly took on a bellicose tone, blending pique at the West\u2019s treatment of Russia with a newfound national confidence. Russia was no longer \u201con its knees.\u201d The idea of the Soviet Union ending with a whimper had always been wishful thinking. This \u2014 Crimea and all that has followed (and may still follow) \u2014 is the bang.\n\u201cRussia is a great power and the West has forgotten this fact,\u201d my friend Tanya told me. We were having lunch in the corner of a second-floor cafe near the Moscow conservatory where she teaches piano. It was late March, not long after the annexation, still sweater weather there. Tanya is a decorated artist, and her eyes dance when she speaks of the Russian soul. That day, she wore gold wireframe glasses, a thin gold wristwatch, and bangles of deep maroon. That day, she was defiant, uncharacteristically so: \u201cThere\u2019s a line you cannot cross. There\u2019s only so much disrespect any person, any country can tolerate. Ukraine is ours. They are our people. Our family. You cannot come into someone else\u2019s home, put down your suitcase, and start telling them how to handle their family. Russia, Belarus, Ukraine \u2014 it\u2019s all one place. It\u2019s thousands of years of collective history. It\u2019s religion; it\u2019s culture; it\u2019s tradition. Thousands of years back to Kievan Rus. Thousands.\u201d\nThe notion that Russia had risen, a trope promoted widely in the Russian media, spoke especially to those who had lived through the \u201chumiliation\u201d of the 1990s. I first moved to Moscow during that time. I was the infant son of two foreign correspondents, and we lived for four years in a drab seven-story apartment complex dubbed \u201cSadSam\u201d by its residents. There, my parents fed me spoonfuls of black caviar bought at deflated prices, and wrote about the Soviet Union, that second reincarnation of the Russian empire, crumbling under the weight of its own facade.\nAt the time, my parents also wrote about Ukraine, about Crimea, about what Russia might become. Rereading their articles now is a bit uncanny:\n\u201cBut among the many fault lines emerging from the collapse of the Soviet Empire, none is as fraught with the potential to start the next Yugoslavia as the Crimea and its fleet. The dispute is deeply rooted in history, symbolizing all of Ukraine\u2019s thwarted aspirations for national identity.\u201d \u2014 Crimea, 1993\n\u201cThe Russians, for the first time in several hundred years, have to define themselves as a nation distinct from empire. Picking up the threads of an intellectual debate begun in the 18th century and buried in the 20th under the heavy blanket of Stalinist state ideology, they ask: What does it mean to be Russian?\u201d \u2014 Moscow, 1994\nI passed my time at SadSam beside Nina and Lora, a pair of Russian babushki, lifelong friends replete with the sort of wisdom that only a wartime childhood in central Siberia could impart. (Nina taught me to chew my meat at least ten times before swallowing. Lora lulled me to sleep by chanting that police come for the children still awake at night.) They called me \u201cNojchik.\u201d\nWhen I got back from Crimea, I went to visit Nina, who I\u2019d reconnected with years later, when I returned to Moscow as a student in 2008. Nina and her family live well outside Moscow\u2019s center, in an old apartment made up of rooms jutting off a long hallway lined, floor to ceiling, with dusty books. A gilded Orthodox icon rests in the corner of every room. I sat across from one in the living room as Nina fed me thick fruitcake with white frosting.\n\u201cNojchik,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019ve wanted to ask this to an American: Why is it OK for America to bomb Iraq, to kill all of those civilians, but it\u2019s not OK for Russia to protect ancient Russian land in Crimea?\u201d\nShe spun a version of a tale I heard many times this spring: The West had refused to acknowledge Russia\u2019s interests for decades; America insisted on dictating to the world, especially on matters it did not understand; Russia had endured this indignity because she had been weak, but now she could not allow it any longer. Now, she was strong again.\nAs Putin said in his Crimea annexation speech, \u201cIf you compress a spring all the way to its limit, it will snap back hard.\u201d\nPutin himself reaped the domestic benefits of this resurgence \u2014 his approval ratings swelled to their highest levels ever, exceeding 80 percent.\nBut taking Crimea was never just about contemporary politics. It was Putin beginning to articulate his answer to the vexed eternal question: \u2018What does it mean to be Russian?\u2019 Grasping Putin\u2019s thinking requires looking backward. As the scholars Clifford Gaddy and Fiona Hill, biographers of Putin, wrote, \u201cAny effort to understand Vladimir Putin must begin with the man of history. For Putin, the interpretation and reinterpretation of history is a crucial matter.\u201d (This is an image he promotes amongst his followers too. \u201cHe\u2019s in a different league; he is in a dialogue with history,\u201d one parliament member from Putin\u2019s ruling party told The New Yorker not long after the Crimea speech.)\nPutin has begun to see himself as a historical figure, as the man who restored Russia to its rightful place in the world order, as the man who brought together a divided people \u2014 as Vladimir the Uniter.\nIn this narrative, the only way forward is to build a Russian world \u2014 a world Putin\u2019s compatriot, the Russian Orthodox Patriarch, Kirill, defined as \u201cthe great Russian civilization that came from the Kievan baptismal font and spread across the huge expanse of Eurasia.\u201d This world is based on \u201cconservative values\u201d and opposition to American hegemony, with Russia acting as a civilizational pole, a bulwark against the decadent overreach of the West.\nThe idea of Russia as a necessary counterpoint to the West is not new. For Russians, the split between Slavophiles and Westernizers is a fundamental cultural fault line. They have been arguing about their relationship to the West for centuries: Is Russia part of Europe, or is it a distinct civilization with its own \u201cspecial path\u201d?\nThe debate reached a nexus in the first half of the nineteenth century, when Tsar Nicholas I, in the wake of the Decembrist Revolt, rejected the empire\u2019s drift toward the West. Instead, he posited an ideology of \u201cOrthodoxy, Autocracy, and Nationality\u201d (an ideology, it\u2019s worth noting, strikingly similar to Putin\u2019s current model).\nAround the same time, as the Russians were debating their standing vis-\u00e0-vis the West, a group of Ukrainian intellectuals began having an identity crisis of their own: Are we Russian, or are we other? Taras Shevchenko, the poet, stood at the forefront of this movement, writing explosive folklore-inspired works, codifying at once a modern Ukrainian language and a common cultural base. He viciously attacked the tsar, treating Russian rulers as conquerors of Ukraine. He articulated a truly Ukrainian identity, planting the seeds of national consciousness. His first collection, Kobzar, published in 1840, featured a poem called Kateryna, which opened with the following lines about \u201cMoskali,\u201d a Ukrainian slur for Russians:\n\u201cFall in love, you dark-browed girls,\nBut not with Moskali.\nFor Moskali are strangers,\nThey will do you wrong.\u201d\nShevchenko later joined the historian Kostomarov and formed a secret society, the Brotherhood of Saints Cyril and Methodius. They met in Kiev \u2014 in smoky basements, I\u2019d like to think \u2014 and plotted the rebirth of Ukraine proper. Perhaps predictably, the tsar soon stamped them out, sending their leaders, Shevchenko and Kostomarov included, into exile, and eventually banning the use of Ukrainian language in print.\nShevchenko\u2019s face, it should be pointed out, is now emblazed on Ukraine\u2019s 100-hrivnya bill, and his statue nearly as ubiquitous in Ukraine as Lenin\u2019s. Kostomarov, meanwhile, managed to publish an essay called \u201cThe Two Russian Nationalities,\u201d which laid out how \u201cGreat Russia\u201d and \u201cLittle Russia\u201d were not, as Russian historiography claimed at the time, the same, but rather two distinct peoples with their own national dispositions. \u201cThe Ukrainians are characterized by individualism, the Great Russians by collectivism,\u201d he wrote at the time.\nTaras Shevchenko, Ukraine\u2019s most prominent national figure, as seen on the 100-hrivnya note\nFor Nina, though, Shevchenko was irrelevant. I suggested to her that, perhaps, Ukraine actually did want to be its own country, that those people on Maidan actually didn\u2019t want to be part of Putin\u2019s Russian world.\nShe sighed, and the wrinkles that ring her eyes rippled. \u201cAnd even if that is so, what does America have to do with it?\u201d she retorted, and cut me another slice of cake.\nThe week after visiting Nina, the day before I was set to return to Ukraine, I went to the banya, the Russian sauna. Banya talk is usually about women, sports, women, work, women. That day though, the men in the entryway lounging in towels and smoking cigarettes talked Crimea. The naked men in the red-walled locker room sipping tea talked Crimea. Even the men inside the steam room beating each other with birch branches talked Crimea.\nMy locker room neighbor was a brawny young boxer named Anton. He had a giant lion tattoo on one shoulder and Christ on the other. He shaved his head with a straight razor. He brewed homemade mint tea, which he brought along in a blue thermos and offered with a smile. He asked me to add him on Instagram, but said sheepishly, \u201cDon\u2019t look at the first picture, it\u2019s not for you.\u201d Of course, I looked: a cartoon caricature of Putin KO-ing Obama with a left hook to the jaw.\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have messed with Ukraine,\u201d he said.\nIt happened to be Easter weekend, so when we all entered the banya itself, the banshik called for a prayer. \u201cI assume there\u2019s no one here who\u2019s not celebrating,\u201d he said to collective laughs. I kept my Jewish-American head down. We huddled eight to a row, shoulders hunched in the heat, sweat dripping onto wooden benches. In this particular banya a giant metal propeller attached to a rotating rod circulates the steam. The banshik, a wizened older man, set the blades in motion and hollered \u2018Christ has risen!\u2019\nThe stone floor shook and the coals hissed.\nIII. THE DONBASS\nAncient Rhythms\nI returned in mid-April to Ukraine for more reporting, and found myself in Slovyansk, a small backwater city in the country\u2019s east. Slovyansk\u2019s central square had the eerie air of swampland when I arrived. The sky, grey with clouds, seemed still. Flags hung limp on their poles. A light fog left the pavement a bit damp, and red tulips lay at the base of a makeshift memorial. Suspicious men, some in camouflage, patrolled. Older women dried teary eyes.\nTwo days earlier, on Easter Sunday, the Ukrainian War\u2019s first blood had been spilt: three local men gunned down at a checkpoint outside of town, the circumstances murky. Russian media (watched religiously by most eastern Ukrainians) claimed that a Ukrainian neo-nationalist group, Right Sektor, bore responsibility. They broadcast a segment showing goods that the attackers allegedly left behind in a burnt out car: reams of ammunition, stacks of crisp U.S. dollars, and the Right Sektor leader\u2019s business card. No one knows who is actually guilty, but the story quickly gained mythic status with the population.\nLocals had gathered around a gold-domed church that day, mourning not only the victims, but also the loss of a world they held dear, a quaint world of factories and farms and post-Soviet stasis. Maidan had shaken its foundations, televised propaganda told of its dismemberment, and Crimea\u2019s annexation raised the prospect of refuge with mother Russia. On the steps of the church, they chanted:\n\u201cNever forget!\u201d\n\u201cGlory, glory, glory!\u201d\n\u201cRussia, Russia, Russia!\u201d\nI met sixty-five-year-old Raisa Rybalka there on the square. She had a blue scarf wrapped around her neck against the chill. Like many in the early days of the conflict, her core grievance was simple: She wanted to be heard. \u201cI\u2019m not marginal, I\u2019m not a terrorist,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m concerned and I have a right to a voice.\u201d Two Lyudmilas joined the conversation. \u201cWe lived normally in the Soviet Union, everything was OK, everything was peaceful,\u201d said one, with deep brown eyes. \u201cWhy are they bothering us now?\u201d They all believed that Ukraine\u2019s government had fallen to a fascist coup. \u201cI\u2019m old, but if they gave me a gun, I\u2019d go fight the fascists,\u201d brown-eyed Lyudmila added. The second Lyudmila chimed in, \u201cWe don\u2019t want Europe. Everything here is connected with Russia.\u201d\nMourning the war\u2019s first casualties in April in Slovyansk, Ukraine. Photo by Noah Sneider\nIt is this integrated identity that has the strongest pull for eastern Ukrainians like Raisa and the Lyudmilas. They live in the Soviet shadow. There on the square in Slovyansk, a statue of Lenin still towers over everything, including a large replica of a rooster, perched in a glass box just steps away. No one could explain why, exactly.\nThe tricolor flag of the Donetsk People\u2019s Republic \u2014 black, blue, red \u2014 hung from the porch of the city administration building behind Lenin\u2019s statue. In forgotten bastions of bureaucracy like this, the now infamous eastern Ukrainian rebels got their start. They popped up in early April and began seizing city halls, police stations, and security services buildings across the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, an area known collectively as the Donbass. The gaggle of women standing with Raisa supported these masked vigilantes. Raisa clasped her hands when she spoke, interlacing her pink-painted fingers, as if in prayer. \u201cOur roots are intertwined,\u201d she said of Russia and Ukraine, \u201cYou can\u2019t split them.\u201d\nYet some Ukrainians have been struggling to split them for hundreds of years, hoping to grow into a distinct national identity of their own. The form of this identity began to coalesce at the turn of 20th century, when the historian Mykhailo Hrushevsky set out writing his History of Ukraine-Rus, codifying the case for a Ukrainian nation distinct from Russia. Nationalist political groups began forming, like the Revolutionary Ukrainian Party, led by students from Kharkiv. In their 1900 manifesto, they called for \u201ca single, unitary, indivisible, free, independent Ukraine.\u201d Around the same time, the Russian imperial historian Vasily Klyuchevsky assembled his canonical work, The Course of Russian History, reasserting the theory of one original Rus\u2019 nationality. (While Putin readily quotes Klyuchevsky, I would be stunned to find Hrushevsky on his shelf.)\nThis budding Ukrainian national movement fused with another strain of social discontent in the empire \u2014 communism. During the Russian revolution of 1905, peasant revolts shook the Ukrainian countryside. And when the crew of the famed Battleship Potemkin rose up in Odessa, two of the mutiny\u2019s leaders were Ukrainians, one of whom had helped found the Revolutionary Ukrainian Party. A brief loosening of the imperial noose followed, leading to a flourishing of the Ukrainian cause. Restrictions on publishing in Ukrainian language were lifted, and cultural organizations spread. That is until Pyotr Stolypin, the tsar\u2019s prime and interior minister (and one of Putin\u2019s heroes), tightened the screws on national movements again. Throughout its history, periods of Ukrainian national rebirth have spawned Russophile backlash.\nIn today\u2019s eastern Ukraine, that backlash came swiftly \u2014 and with a push from Putin. (The irony is that few have done more to consolidate Ukrainian national identity than Putin himself.) Those who took up arms in those early days were not little green men; they were largely locals \u2014 veterans and factory workers, downtrodden and distraught. There may have been a layer of clandestine Russian agents directing the entire operation, but the men on the streets, at the checkpoints, and in the buildings bore little resemblance to the stoics in Crimea. This was not special ops, it was the people. Like the protestors around Lenin in Kharkiv, they felt themselves under assault. They sensed that their identity was in peril.\nYou can disagree. You can belittle the reasoning. But the fact remains: These men feel threatened enough to leave their wives and children and head to the front lines. Nobody takes such a decision lightly. The stakes are not abstract. Russian propaganda is noxious and powerful, no doubt, but like it any drug, it needs receptors. In the Donbass, they proved simple to find.\nAs the funeral service got underway, I stood beside the church with a pocket of these fighters, men in motley uniforms, with mismatched weapons. They answered to a middle-aged man, Yuri, who commanded respect because he served four years in Afghanistan during the Soviet war there. Yuri and his crew led the seizure of Slavyansk\u2019s police station on April 12, an act that helped make this otherwise sleepy town the epicenter of the separatist movement for a time. The Donbass, Yuri told me, is \u201cspecial.\u201d\nIt\u2019s true \u2014 the Donbass has long played a special role in Ukraine\u2019s ill-fated attempts at independence. When the 1917 revolution brought the Tsarist empire crashing down into civil war, Ukraine underwent its own tumultuous metamorphosis. Nationalists seized the moment to declare a Ukrainian People\u2019s Republic. Hrushevsky became a founding father (his image is on the current 50-Hrivnya bill). Ukraine attempted to determine its borders, detaching itself at once from both Russia and Poland, fighting Europe\u2019s Central Powers and the rising Soviet Union. Then, like now, the masters in Moscow had their own plans. Eastern Ukraine, with its Russified urban and industrial centers, became a front for the Bolsheviks to destabilize and eventually subsume Ukraine\u2019s national aspirations.\n\nUnable to take Kiev initially, Bolshevik supporters set up their own republics in country\u2019s east. The Kremlin, at one point, sent in troops under the guise of the so-called Ukrainian Soviet Republic, headquartered in Kharkiv.\nAnd then denied that it had done so. The Soviet Commissar of Foreign Affairs, Georgy Chicherin, in a letter to the Kiev government, used language eerily similar to that coming from today\u2019s Russian officials:\n\u201cWe must advise you that your information concerning the advance of our troops into the territory of the Ukraine does not correspond with the facts. The military units which you have perceived are not ours. There is no army of the Russian Soviet Republic on Ukrainian territory. The military operations taking place on Ukrainian territory involve the army of the Directory and the army of Piatakov. Between the Ukraine and Soviet Russia there are at present no armed conflicts.\u201d\nA few days after the funeral for the men killed on Easter, I went to see Yuri near his base in Slovyansk. He had a crew of locals filling sandbags and building a new checkpoint on the outskirts of town, working all day. \u201cLook at these \u2018separatists\u2019 yourself \u2014 it\u2019s simple people,\u201d Yuri said. Ukrainian authorities had been dropping fliers on the city, instructing locals on how to behave in areas where \u201cseparatists\u201d and \u201cterrorists\u201d were active. They read, in part, \u201cAll separatists and terrorists are not peaceful citizens, they are marginals, criminals, and drug addicts.\u201d This did little to endear the new authorities in Kiev to their countrymen in the Donbass. In fact, many of the \u201cseparatists and terrorists\u201d were fairly ordinary people with families and neighbors and friends. At the outset, their goals were amorphous. Even amongst themselves, the rebels bickered over what future they wanted \u2014 a Ukrainian one, a Russian one, or some undefined independence?\nYuri, for his part, grew up in a town some twenty minutes down the road from Slavyansk. \u201cI\u2019m for Ukraine. I\u2019m a Ukrainian, and I have a Ukrainian name,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to be in the Ukraine that has come to power \u2014 the junta.\u201d For Yuri and his comrades, the word \u201cjunta\u201d became a snappy stand-in for \u201cpeople I don\u2019t agree with.\u201d His military service decades behind him, Yuri now has weight around his gut, and wrinkles on his forehead. \u201cWe\u2019re Slavs. For centuries we\u2019ve lived peacefully together with Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine in one family. Why tear apart these relationships? We are one people.\u201d\nYuri, a rebel commander, watches a Victory Day parade at his base in Slovyansk, Ukraine. Photo by Noah Sneider\nYuri came to run a small construction company in his hometown, where he stayed active in a local veterans\u2019 organization. He watched with horror as the Soviet Union collapsed. He raised a daughter amidst the chaos of the 1990s. And he clung dearly to his beliefs. \u201cWe\u2019re different people, western Ukraine and eastern Ukraine. They\u2019re raised on the traditions of their forefathers, on the traditions of Sukhevich, Mazepa, Bandera. They believe those men to be gods, and we believe them to be killers. Western Ukraine was freed from Poland only in 1939. They have a completely different history, a different worldview.\u201d Yuri gives orders with an officer\u2019s bearing. He can be ruthless, in rhetoric and in deed. \u201cIf they kill one of us, ten will rise,\u201d he says. He wears a small Turkish nazar bracelet, a gift from his niece, which he sometimes runs through his coarse fingers. \u201cIt helps me when I\u2019m nervous.\u201d\nThe divisions Yuri brings up do exist, though they\u2019re not as simple as east and west. The contest, rather, is between emerging Ukrainian identities and ossified Russophile and Soviet ones. Between those who see themselves as essentially extensions of Russia, and those who, in the tradition of Shevchenko and Hrushevsky, believe themselves to be something fundamentally different.\nEven after Ukraine became part of the Soviet Union in 1922, Ukrainian patriots pushed on. In fact, a policy of \u2018Ukrainianization\u2019 took hold during the relatively free 1920s, as Soviet nationality policy then followed Lenin\u2019s internationalist instincts, seeing the growth of national identities as part of throwing off the imperial yoke. Schools began teaching widely in Ukrainian. Homegrown literary movements emerged. In these cultural spaces, the dream of independence lived on. Many of Ukraine\u2019s leading writers advocated for communism, but with a distinct Ukrainian culture, one oriented toward the West. The group Vaplite, for example, used the slogan \u201cAway from Moscow.\u201d\nThis was a stretch for Stalin, who, once in power, hit Ukraine particularly hard. He moved first to crush the Ukrainian national movement, instituting Russification policies and repopulating Ukrainian cities with native Russians. Then the Holodomor famine killed millions of Ukrainians in the early 30s. And finally Stalin\u2019s brutal purges sent any last shreds of a Ukrainian national consciousness underground.\nThey reemerged with Khrushchev\u2019s thaw, and again Ukrainian writers began advocating for a national identity. Ivan Dzyuba wrote a scathing treatise called \u201cInternationalism or Russification?\u201d and criticized the Soviet regime for not-so-secretly harboring \u201cGreat Russian nationalism\u201d and \u201cGreat-Power ideas.\u201d He lamented the suppression of Ukrainian history and culture, and called for a rally around the \u201cnational cause.\u201d But Brezhnev soon put an end to all that talk.\nThese kinds of scars still haunt modern Ukraine. In 2007, Ukraine\u2019s pro-Western president, Viktor Yushchenko, wrote an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal, appealing to Western governments to recognize the Holodomor famine as genocide: \u201cOther parts of the Soviet Union suffered terribly as well. But in the minds of the Soviet leadership there was a dual purpose in persecuting and starving the Ukrainian peasantry. It was part of a campaign to crush Ukraine\u2019s national identity and its desire for self-determination.\u201d Russian officials and scholars vehemently opposed this stance, as did the leader of Ukraine\u2019s pro-Russian Party of Regions, Viktor Yanukovych.\nIn the history of today\u2019s war, May 2 will become a scar of its own.\nThat was the day when more than fifty pro-Russian protestors died in a fire in Odessa, trapped inside a burning building. (That event marked a point of no return for many rebels.) That was the day when the Ukrainian army began its siege of Slavyansk. (The interim Ukrainian government had been dabbling with a so-called \u201canti-terrorist operation\u201d for weeks, but had yet to make any series advances.) That was the day when a column of tanks and troops arrived, and moved swiftly onto a hill where the town\u2019s TV tower stood.\nFrom this high point, the Ukrainians could shell nearly anywhere in the city. It became the source of their strength, and of much sorrow. That was the day when the killing started. It hasn\u2019t really stopped since.\nIt is important to speak the names of the dead. Numbers scrub the human from the act, providing something sterile to measure against. (Yesterday: twelve killed, twenty-two wounded. Today: two killed, twelve wounded. Not so bad.) But names spoken aloud have pitch, cadence, timbre. I will never forget the first time I heard the name Irina Boevets.\nWe stood in a stairwell.\nA whisper: I-ri-na.\nHalf rest.\nA hoarse breath.\nQuarter rest.\nA slackening: Bo-e-vetsss.\nHis eyes were still red. He still wore sea green hospital scrubs. His wife was dead.\n\u201cHer name was Irina. Irina Boevets,\u201d Sergey said. \u201cShe was on the balcony. Our next-door neighbor was there on her balcony close by. They can see each other there, and were probably just chatting. I closed the car and went up the stairs\u2026 A neighbor\u2026 said she heard a crack. A little clap. Probably more like a smack. Like the sound of someone falling.\u201d\nOn May 5th, 2014, a single bullet struck the left side of Irina Boevets\u2019s head. She was not a fighter. She was a schoolteacher, thirty years old. She was at home, more than a mile away from the battle that was taking place on the outskirts of Slovyansk. If she had taken one step to the side \u2014 a difference of half a foot \u2014 she might still be alive.\nThe funeral for Yulia Izotova, 21, in Kramatorsk, Ukraine drew hundreds of mourners. Photo by Noah Sneider\nThis is the math of war. It has exponential power, for every fallen one affects tens, even hundreds, and ripples through time. One generation passes its tales and its prejudices on to the next. This was clear during the Victory Day parade in Slovyansk, when World War II veterans received a heroes\u2019 welcome. Their legacy carries unprecedented weight in the Russian world. I met Romazan Mukhamad-Galiev there. At ninety, he still donned his navy uniform. Children gathered to take photos and hand him fists full of roses.\nThis year\u2019s celebration meant more than ever he said. This year, \u201can enemy appeared outside again: the Banderas.\u201d\nNo one figure is as fraught in Ukraine these days as Stepan Bandera. His portrait hung for months on the Maidan. Putin, meanwhile, has invoked the \u201cideological heirs of Bandera\u201d to build his alternate reality, in which Kiev has been taken by neo-Nazis.\nBorn before the revolution in Ukraine\u2019s west, Bandera became a fierce nationalist. He ran a group called the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists, which declared war against all countries that controlled ethnic Ukrainian lands, putting him at odds with Poland, the USSR, and Germany. But he ultimately allied with the Nazis \u2014 most scholars say because it seemed the most expedient way to attain Ukrainian independence. The Nazis, though, eventually took Ukraine, and tossed Bandera into a concentration camp once he had ceased being useful to them. He died later, in Munich, poisoned at the hands of the KGB. Like Mazepa before him, he became a hero to Ukraine\u2019s nationalist crowd, and a pariah to Russians.\nAt the Slavyansk Victory Day parade, Romazan repeated, with no hint of irony, \u201cWe have to fight the Banderas.\u201d The children looked on, wide-eyed, like someone was telling a ghost story.\nWorld War II veterans pass their tales to the children of Slovyansk during Victory Day celebrations. Photo by Noah Sneider\nOf course, not everyone believed that the fascists were on the march again. At one point I came upon a group of men cutting down a tree. The ringleader wore a red work suit, and looked like a figure torn from the pages of Soviet propaganda. I thought they wanted to build a barricade, but they explained otherwise: This tree, said one, has been ill for years, but the old city government was too incompetent to deal with it. Now, with the old authorities gone and the new ones preoccupied, they were taking the chance to handle it themselves. \u201cRegular people don\u2019t care who comes to power, we just want this all to end,\u201d red-suited Denis said. His friend Aleksei chimed in: \u201cI\u2019ve seen Europe. I don\u2019t want to go back to Russia.\u201d The men gathered there spoke with disdain of their peers in the militia. \u201cI see my classmates at the barricades sometimes,\u201d said Denis. \u201cTo be honest, they\u2019re the ones who haven\u2019t achieved anything in life.\u201d\nThe divisions did largely break down along socioeconomic (and educational) lines. Those with more to lose had less interest in playing war. For many in eastern Ukraine, the movement offered something they had long been missing: meaning. The Donbass is a place where people toil to no end. Being a rebel gave an underemployed factory worker a sense of purpose, all the more so when the cause was infused with history.\nBut behind the mask of patriotism and glory, the rebel regime operated with brutal impunity. A shadowy Muscovite named Igor Girkin took control of the movement\u2019s military wing throughout eastern Ukraine. Girkin, who goes by the alias Strelkov, or \u2018the shooter,\u2019 served in Russia\u2019s security services, and fought in nearly every post-Soviet conflict from Transnistria to Serbia to Chechnya. His revanchist views align with a certain strain of Russian nationalism that has become increasingly powerful throughout the Ukrainian crisis.\nUnder Strelkov and his successors, kidnappings, murder, and torture have become commonplace in the breakaway Donetsk and Luhansk People\u2019s Republics. The basement of the security services building in Slovyansk became a notorious dungeon, housing dozens of prisoners in squalid conditions. While the rebels demonstrated a formidable capacity for destruction, they did little to build the new life they so desired.\nBuilding polling booths ahead of the rebel referendum in the Donbass. Photo by Noah Sneider\nThey held a sham referendum in the Donbass, a vote at gunpoint, and declared their independence on May 11th. Together they called themselves Novorossiya, a revived name for lands conquered by Catherine the Great centuries ago.\nThe Ukrainians held an election too, though not in Novorossiya. They picked a chocolate baron, Petro Poroshenko, as president on May 25th. They cheered their independence. Little did they know, the struggle had just begun. Within days, a bloody battle for the Donetsk airport broke out.\nThe Russians began arriving in droves. How exactly they got there, no one really knows. Were they explicitly sent across the border? Or were they merely waved through? Were they volunteers or mercenaries? Chechens or \u201creal\u201d Russians? Most would call themselves \u201cvolunteers,\u201d there to help their brothers. At the time, this rung true \u2014 it was a few months still before regular Russian troops began operating brazenly inside eastern Ukraine. Crimea wasn\u2019t enough; Russia would do whatever it took to keep Ukraine from breaking off of the Slavic family tree.\nOne of the rebel leaders, a lanky dude with untrimmed stubble named Sergey, approached a few of us journalists on the terrace of our hotel a few days after the airport battle. \u201cA convoy is leaving for the border tomorrow.\u201d He looked harried. \u201cWith what?\u201d His camouflage hung loose. \u201cBodies. Russian bodies.\u201d\nThe next day, as they stacked coffins outside the morgue, I felt a hand on my shoulder. I turned to see \u201cMedved,\u201d the Bear, a rebel who must weigh more than 300 pounds. Tattoos spill out of his sleeves and down his arms. He wears dark circular sunglasses a la John Lennon. He keeps his shirt unbuttoned at the top. From a necklace hangs a giant bear tooth, still sharp at the edges. His eyes, though, are kind. \u201cOnce this is over, we\u2019ll go for a beer,\u201d he liked to say.\nLook to your right, he told me. I saw Yuri, incognito in a black leather jacket and black aviators. We recognized each other with knowing nods, and walked away from the coffins, around a wall, into a clearing. He had disappeared for weeks, I was sure he had been killed. Where the hell have you been, what happened? He said something about being taken prisoner, four broken ribs, and not feeling pain. (I wanted to say it was only a matter of time, but there are things one does not say to a rebel commander on his territory.) Then, a smile. Something about trust. A scowl. Something about fascists and juntas, loyalty and Russianness. Something in the language of war. It is a reductive language, making phantoms of foes, and foes of phantoms.\nSeparatist fighters on the way to battle in Slovyansk, Ukraine. Photo by Noah Sneider\nOn the other wide of the wall, two rows of empty coffins rested in a shady grove. A truck idled, and morticians loaded bodies, some of them draped in blue and yellow cloth. The side of the truck said, in French, \u201cFresh Products.\u201d From the morgue, the convoy left for an ice cream factory on the outskirts of town \u2014 the public facilities couldn\u2019t handle that many corpses, so the rest were stashed in a commercial refrigerator. Cookie dough, chocolate swirl, headless rebel.\nA chubby woman in camouflage controlled the factory gates. She had peroxide blonde hair and a beady stare. When she finally let us through, we found nine coffins in the loading bay. They all bore gold crosses and the Donetsk People\u2019s Republic flag. The bodies had been packed in black plastic trash bags. Shrapnel wounds laced legs and faces with deep gashes. A fighter from Russia\u2019s North Ossetia region watched over the process. He carried an AK-74 and two pistols, just in case. \u201cOur grandfathers and grandmothers fought fascism, and I wanted to fight fascists too,\u201d he said by way of an explanation for how he found himself overseeing a covert repatriation mission in an eastern Ukrainian ice cream factory.\nNext door, a family mourned in the \u201cPenguin Caf\u00e9.\u201d The wake was for Mark Zverev, a local who died alongside the Russians. Another big woman, Svetlana, with short dark hair, held court on the patio. Her voice was deep and gravely and as she spoke, her earrings of blue amethyst fluttered: \u201cHe died fighting for our bright future, for our faith.\u201d Mark\u2019s daughter was there too, staring at the ground: \u201cHe told us, \u2018What, will I just sit and watch while they kill our people, our children? I will defend you\u2019.\u201d A family friend shook his head in disbelief: \u201cWe are brotherly peoples. My family came to Ukraine from Russia.\u201d\nIn these comments lies the essence of entire war, a war that\u2019s already taken some 3,700 lives. Future and faith, they and us, brothers fighting, Russia and Ukraine. A millennia-long struggle for identity has come to a head. Two nations riding fundamentally incompatible historical narratives have crashed. The stakes could not be higher, and not simply because Russia fears NATO expansion, but because Russia fears losing its brother, losing its family, and thus losing itself.\nA truck full of the bodies of Russian fighters travels from Donetsk back to Russia. Photo by Noah Sneider\nIn the loading bay, a man painted the side of the truck: two red crosses and \u201c200\u201d in big black brush strokes \u2014 Russian code for casualties. We set out for the border as dusk fell. The truck stopped near Lenin Square to pick up one last coffin, and with that, we were off.\nJust outside the city, lush fields and dense woods obscured the black soil of the bloodlands. Our driver, a local doctor, Dima, remarked: \u201cIt\u2019s so green, fresh, alive, and then\u2026 a truck full of dead bodies.\u201d Flowers \u2014 small yellow buds \u2014 lined the road. We came upon a Ukrainian army checkpoint, the 25th Airborne Brigade. They had no protocol for a coffin rig. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like this,\u201d one soldier said, AK at the ready.\nWhen we hit the border at Uspenka, the guards asked the truck driver \u2014 a Donetsk local \u2014 for his passport. In Russia and Ukraine, everyone has two passports, a domestic and an international. The driver hadn\u2019t taken his international passport with him. In the past, he said, the crossing there had been treated as domestic.\nSo they checked more documents and made hurried phone calls, and eventually the border guards lit up the cargo bed with flashlights. They waved the bodies through as night fell. In the sky above, Ursa Major rose.\nEPILOGUE\nHistory is at once linear and cyclical. The universe is expanding outwards into the stars, but at the same time the earth spins on its axis. So too does humankind move forward while remaining subject to the same old rhythms.\nThis summer, Russia and Ukraine slipped into a dark cycle. The means have been modern, but the shape primordial, harkening back to the earliest Slavic chronicles.\n\u201cIf ye abide in amity with one another, God will dwell among you, and will subject your enemies to you, and ye will live at peace. But if ye dwell in envy and dissension, quarreling with one another, then ye will perish yourselves and bring to ruin the land of your ancestors, which they won at the price of great effort.\u201d\nThe last grasp of Tatiana Piskunova, killed in shelling outside Donetsk, Ukraine. Photo by Noah Sneider\nAfter the election in May, President Poroshenko went to Normandy, where he met Putin and paid tribute to the D-Day dead. They shook hands in crisp suits and spoke of peace. Some 270 had died in Ukraine already. Then three tanks slipped across the Russian border. Unwrapped, unsigned gifts.\nThe city of Mariupol, to the south, soon fell to Kiev\u2019s guard. The miners had emerged from their shafts and demanded order there, and no one messes with the miners. The separatists fled, bleeding.\nThen the separatists brought down a Ukrainian plane, killing forty-nine. Russia cut off gas supplies. A ceasefire followed, though the fighting never stopped. \u201cBakh\u2013bakh\u2013bakh,\u201d they said to each other, speaking in shells. Russian troops amassed at the border. Putin again spoke of peace and smiled his sly smile. Ukraine signed a treaty with the EU. \u201cBakh\u2013bakh\u2013bakh,\u201d said the separatists. \u201cWe will attack and liberate our land,\u201d Poroshenko said to all who would listen.\nSlavyansk fell, and the rebels retreated. Donetsk became the new center. More Bakh\u2013bakh\u2013bakh, bigger Bakh\u2013bakh\u2013bakh. Thirty dead one day, twenty-three the next. Eleven here, sixteen there. Civilian and soldiers, rebels and the government \u2014 it all became indiscriminate.\nThen Malaysia Airlines Flight 17. Two hundred ninety eight at once. A field, sunflowers, bodies. \u201cHell\u201d, some called it, and they were right.\nBut this did not stop the fighting. Instead it only accelerated. One thousand and then two thousand total. Now they say three thousand maybe even four.\nStrelkov left, the Tsar arrived. The Ukrainians advanced, the rebels panicked. Putin growled, Poroshenko shrunk. Lenin finally fell in Kharkiv. A new ceasefire was called, and a new ceasefire crumbled. Bakh\u2013bakh-BAKH.\nThese are the narratives of bygone years regarding the origin of the land of Rus\u2019, the first princes of Kiev, and from what source the land of Rus\u2019 had its beginning.\nLet us accordingly begin\u2026\nNoah Sneider is a writer and artist.

In September 2021 alone, 4.4 million Americans quit their jobs.\nBut some of us out there kept our jobs, and, shock horror, we actually like them.\nEntrepreneurship isn\u2019t for everyone. As glamorous as doing your own thing might seem, a steady paycheck is often necessary, especially when you\u2019re supporting a family.\nMy experience has shown me that companies need to step up to keep people. People are fed-up with subpar treatment and have every right to demand better. As there\u2019s always a flood of articles about entrepreneurship and quitting your terrible day job, I thought I would offer an alternative, positive perspective.\nHere\u2019s why I haven\u2019t resigned.\nManagement\nMy manager listens when I tell her something is wrong and takes action. We discuss any ideas I have, and many are taken on board. I feel like an equal. There\u2019s never any micro-management or a feeling of \u201ccontrol\u201d over every little thing I do. I\u2019m free to try things and learn from my mistakes.\nI expect three things from my manager; freedom, flexibility, and trust, and they have kept me at my job (as an individual contractor with no benefits, I might add) for almost 4 years now. The freedom to try new things and learn from my mistakes. The flexibility to live wherever I\u2019d like, as long as I complete my work. The trust to do things with no micro-management.\nPeople don\u2019t leave companies; they leave bad relationships, especially managerial ones. A 2018 study by Udemy found that at least half of employees surveyed quit their jobs because of their manager.\nIf you\u2019re looking to retain employees for longer, it starts with management. How would you like to be managed? What do you expect from your manager? If your company is experiencing high turnover, sit your staff down and ask them why. Listen to their grievances and brainstorm how to solve them.\nYes, some people are lazy and prefer to rely on unemployment benefits (I know some of these people), but most just want better working conditions. Communication is key. Ask why.\nColleagues\nIf you\u2019re unsure about staying at your job, ask yourself this question: Would I go out for a coffee with my colleagues?\nI\u2019d have a coffee with every single person on my team and senior management. They\u2019re kind, empathetic, and we\u2019d have a lot to talk about that has nothing to do with work.\nYou can always switch careers and professions, but what matters most are the people, the company culture. If you feel good, you\u2019ll stay longer. If you feel abused, you\u2019ll quit as soon as you can.\nThis is why companies should allow prospective employees to speak with a few members of the team they might be joining. This is an opportunity for both sides to assess their future relationship and whether there\u2019s a match.\nI don\u2019t believe in colleagues being \u201cfamily\u201d or even friends. What has kept me at my full-time job are the positive, professional relationships I have with my team members (including the people I manage).\nFlexibility\nBefore the pandemic, I traveled while working. It was a great perk of being an associate. The option to work remotely and never set foot in an office works best for my lifestyle. I can\u2019t imagine living in the same city and having to commute. I divided my time between Morocco and Greece when we could travel without restrictions, experiencing both countries while working.\nI can also work whenever I want. Most days, I\u2019m up early to get work done so that I can write in the evenings. Some days I work later. I also changed my schedule in August 2020 from working 40 hours in five days to doing it in four, with Fridays off. I now have a weekday to write, run errands, go for long walks, or do whatever I want.\nIn 2018, at least 96% of U.S. professionals wanted more flexibility at their jobs, particularly the ability to work when and where they\u2019d like. But only 54% reported having this flexibility, illustrating a gap between what companies were offering and what employees wanted.\nWith the pandemic, this has changed, and the jobs that employees were told couldn\u2019t be remote suddenly are. Globally, employees are asking for better working conditions, and rightfully so.\nCareer Progression\nI was in a bit of a rut last year. After over three years of being an associate researcher working in executive search within the international development sector, I was experiencing a lull in my career. I felt unsure whether I was in the right place or doing the right thing.\nMy manager sensed it, so we had a conversation about how I\u2019d like to progress in my career. We talked about my interests, where I see myself within the company, and how to use my strengths. We agreed that taking on a more managerial role would be a good next step. I didn\u2019t want to become a consultant, which is the next step after researcher, so we had to try something different.\nCareer progression and feeling supported to take paths that aren\u2019t conventional is important. 83% of 5,000 surveyed employees in the US and the UK felt companies should support career progression.\nEmployees need to feel that the company they\u2019re working for cares about them. Managers can do this by having those difficult, sometimes uncomfortable conversations and being open to employees trying things out. Set career paths aren\u2019t for everyone. Again, flexibility is key.\nPeople aren\u2019t quitting their jobs because they\u2019re bored. They\u2019re quitting because companies don\u2019t care for them enough or listen to their very valid grievances. Good management, positive relationships with my colleagues, flexibility, and the opportunity to grow in my career are the top four things that have kept me at my job.\nHow we work has permanently changed now. Companies that do more for their employees will survive, while those who don\u2019t will fail. The employees have spoken. Companies need to listen.\nDo you like your job? Hate it? Why? What can your company do better?\nThanks for reading! \u2764\nFeel free to reach out: razanecherk@gmail.com.

This means managing time zones, remote working, and cultural differences from my 10-square-meter bedroom in Morocco.\nI\u2019m shy, introverted, and pretty damn awkward sometimes, making it an even more daunting challenge. I\u2019ve also never met my team members in person because they\u2019re new, having joined us during these pandemic times.\nSo how does a stuttering introvert who couldn\u2019t even say hello on the phone five years ago handle being a manager? It\u2019s taken quite a few years of work, but it boils down to doing these four things.\nChoose authenticity\nDon\u2019t push against your shy, quiet nature. Embrace it. There\u2019s strength in silence. There\u2019s power in stuttering through a sentence and choosing to keep your head held high, rather than saying sorry for something you can\u2019t help.\nPrepare before heading into a meeting. Whisper positive affirmations to yourself. Whatever you need to do, but go into it being yourself. You\u2019d be surprised at how attractive that is to people.\nDon\u2019t fake a smile or pretend to be someone you\u2019re not. The more you simply accept who you are, the better you\u2019ll get at doing the things managers need to do, many of which may go against your introverted nature.\nPeople can wait while you stutter. The world won\u2019t end. Being a manager doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re perfect. It doesn\u2019t mean you have to be extroverted or fake being one to be a \u201cgood\u201d manager.\nListen more than you talk\nI used to think only outgoing, talkative extroverts could succeed as managers. But then I stepped into this managerial role myself and realized I had to listen more than I spoke.\nI had to ask the right questions, sit back, and pay attention not only to the words spoken but also to the tone used. I had to catch when someone wasn\u2019t being honest about how they felt and when there was something more they weren\u2019t saying.\nYou have two ears but only one mouth for a reason, so pay attention!\nDon\u2019t micromanage\nAs a new manager, especially if you\u2019re working remotely and haven\u2019t even met your new team members, it can be tempting to check in more. You can get paranoid about what people are doing.\nBut you need to push back against that temptation. We build solid, professional relationships on a foundation of trust. Micromanagement spells death to any trust between you and your team members.\nSchedule regular calls. I have mine once every two weeks, but once per week when you\u2019re just starting can be a good idea to strengthen your collaboration.\nAsk them to:\nTell you how they\u2019re doing! We\u2019re humans first, employees much further down the list\u2026\nRun you through the projects they\u2019re working on, what stages they\u2019re at, and how things are going overall.\nLet you know if there are any challenges they\u2019re facing.\nTell you if there\u2019s anything else.\nThen, listen. That\u2019s the core of your job!\nShow, don\u2019t tell\nAs a manager, you have a bigger responsibility than you had as a staff member. You\u2019re the company example that people have to look up to, and this is especially crucial when they\u2019re new.\nThis was once very stressful for me, but I\u2019ve now gotten used to it. It\u2019s pretty simple:\nShow up on time to meetings (unless you have a very good excuse not to).\nVolunteer for opportunities when no one else is.\nWhen training, be visual. Illustrate more, explain less.\nTraining your new team members doesn\u2019t end after the first week or two. It continues on as they learn from your actions, advice, and guidance.\nConclusion\nChoose authenticity over fitting in, listening over speaking, trust over fear. Demonstrate what you mean. Don\u2019t hide your failures or your stutter. You\u2019re allowed to be, to exist exactly as you are. You can choose to take up the amount of space you want to take up. No one can take that away from you.\nI know that can be easier said than done when you\u2019re in the middle of a presentation you weren\u2019t prepared for or nervous about having a difficult conversation, but it\u2019ll get easier the more you do it.\nBeing a manager doesn\u2019t mean perfection. Far from it. It entails doing your best to be a good example to your team, and that includes showing them your flaws.\nYes, you\u2019re there to guide them towards success (whatever that means in their roles), but putting too much pressure on yourself isn\u2019t the way to do it. Especially if you\u2019re a shy introvert like myself. Take it easy, keep trying, and you\u2019ll succeed!\nThanks for reading! \u2764\nReach out to me with comments, questions, or feedback: razanecherk@gmail.com.

The evidence is growing that social media is particularly damaging to adolescent girls. A lot of recent research shows that limiting our social media usage can significantly improve our emotional well-being.\nI never really \u201cgot\u201d social media. It took me a long time to get a Facebook profile. Even longer to get on Instagram. As a millennial, it felt weird not to be obsessed with likes and comments like the rest of my friends. I thought there was something wrong with me!\nOver the years, I noticed how uncomfortable I felt as a scrolled on social media. My chest would tighten, my eyes would ache the more I squinted at the tiny text on my screen, my mouth would dry up.\nBut I ignored the signs my body was giving me that what I was doing wasn\u2019t right.\nIsn\u2019t social media the way of the world now? How can I grow as a writer if I\u2019m not on social media? Am I losing out if I don\u2019t post at least a few times per week?\nI asked myself these questions over the last year, as I continued to notice how terrible I felt every time I scrolled through the various platforms. Even commenting on other people\u2019s posts and uploading my own thoughts felt draining. Eventually, late last year, after feeling like a slave to social media, I stopped posting and consuming.\nI know I\u2019m not the only one out there who thinks: \u201cI hate this, but I HAVE to get my work out there.\u201d Right? Well, Michael Thompson\u2019s recent article on focusing on your art rather than marketing explains perfectly how I did things from then on.\nThe best way for me to grow as a writer is to write! It seems so obvious, yet many of us focus too much on the marketing side just because we think we have to. If you enjoy consuming and posting on social media, then yes, go for it! But it isn\u2019t for everyone.\nForcing yourself to do something that goes against your nature will not do much good for your art.\nMy quality of life improved immensely when I stopped using social media. I spent more time with my mom talking, connecting, and going out for long walks. I focused on my goals and started working on bringing a big idea that had lied dormant for years to life.\nI took naps on the weekends and spent time just lying on my yoga mat after a good workout. I stared at the ceiling, letting my mind wander. And yet, I was still more productive than I had been before. I was much more content and grateful because I wasn\u2019t looking at what other people were doing. It\u2019s made life feel so much better.\nI\u2019m just not a fast-paced person. I like slow mornings and taking an hour for breakfast. I enjoy cracking jokes with my mom and playing with my cat. Why do we spend hours on social media scrolling and comparing when we could spend that time with our loved ones instead?!\nNext time you\u2019re on a social media app scrolling, tune into your body. Notice how you feel. Is your mind racing? Your heart beating a little too fast? Anything else you\u2019d rather be doing with your time? I bet you\u2019d quit it too if you took a few moments to check in with yourself!\nSocial media is fine in small doses. \u201cEverything in moderation\u201d applies in this case too, although many don\u2019t realize it. Our eyes can\u2019t take constant screen time. They need a break, as do our brains.\nI challenge you to delete your social media apps for one week to start. You won't regret it. You\u2019ll feel freer, happier, and much more relaxed. Let me know how it goes in the comments!\nP.S. Check out Charlie Brown\u2019s recent weekly letter about social media strikes. Read her thoughts here.\nSimilar to Charlie, the places I\u2019m still on and don\u2019t find draining are Medium (I can\u2019t live without writing) and LinkedIn (The platform I need for my job). :)\nThanks for reading! \u2764\nReach out to me with comments, questions, or feedback: razanecherk@gmail.com.\nIf you like my work and want to support me, you can buy me a coffee or purchase a Medium membership using my link.", "comment_count": 9, "like_count": 557, "created_time": 1644752594573, "comment": [{"user_id": "f480ea35b0e8", "comment_time": 1644752594573, "comment": "Thank you for sharing!"}, {"user_id": "ed1b3397d82f", "comment_time": 1644919973893, "comment": "This is me and I completely relate to what you are saying in this article!

Don\u2019t we all love those stories? Aren\u2019t they inspiring? Well, it depends on how you handle the information.\nDo you see it as inspiration or do you want to re-create someone else\u2019s path, expecting the same result? I stopped consuming this content when I noticed a pattern.\nMost, if not all, of these successes involve unique backstories. Some experience an awakening in their lives. They lose their jobs and try something unexpected that works out. Others experience some kind of epiphany after a difficult time that leads them down a specific path. And many are lucky. They were at the right place, at the right time, and things fell into place.\nWe\u2019re all on different life paths and have experienced very different things that have led us to where we are at this very moment.\nSo here\u2019s what I do instead of looking at what others are doing.\nDefine your values\nWhat do you care about? What do you NOT care about? What do you enjoy doing? What do you DESPISE doing? Get honest with yourself and figure out what is meaningful to YOU, not others. This is what will set you on the right path.\nGetting to know yourself is one of the most important keys to \u201cmaking it\u201d in life. The better you know where you are and where you want to go, the clearer your path will become.\nSo many of us go through life blind because we aren\u2019t clear about what we want!\nRealize there\u2019s no set path for anything\nNo one can tell you what to do or how to do something. There\u2019s nothing wrong with seeking advice or inspiration, but remember that each person\u2019s life journey is different.\nThere\u2019s no one-size-fits-all. There are MANY ways to become a skilled writer, a millionaire, or a world-renowned archaeologist. There\u2019s also nothing wrong with wanting to stay in the town you were born and live a simple life surrounded by your friends and family.\nInstead of analyzing how to do something and obsessing over achieving a certain goal, just let things flow. Whatever is meant to happen will happen. You can\u2019t control everything. Focus on what you can control and let the rest go!\nExperiment\nYou can read all the guidebooks in the world and still not realize your goals because there\u2019s nothing like figuring things out for yourself. You can read, even watch a documentary, about what it\u2019s like to build a home, but you\u2019ll never truly understand the process until you do it yourself.\nTalk to people. Connect with those doing what you want to do and see what you can learn from them. Get inspired, then do your own thing. Try things out for yourself instead of taking someone else\u2019s word for it.\nAnd guess what? What you thought you wanted might not be the right thing! That\u2019s fine. Go back to the drawing board. Try again. Action is the key here. Stop wasting time reading about other people and get out there and just do things. You\u2019ll learn so much more that way.\nRemember: It\u2019s never too late\nKathleen Martinez, a Dominican lawyer turned archaeologist, left her old life behind and moved to Egypt to search for Cleopatra\u2019s tomb. I mean, how random is that? She spent her entire life in the Dominican Republic, got married, and had children, before suddenly deciding to pursue her lifelong dream of finding an Egyptian tomb.\nI love reading these inspirational stories, not to copy someone\u2019s path, but to realize some key life truths. It\u2019s never too late to try something different. It\u2019s never too late to start over.\nAs my mother loves to remind me: \u201cThere\u2019s a solution to everything, except death, so while you\u2019re alive, keep trying.\u201d\nWe live in a toxic time of desperation. We\u2019re desperate to make more money, to become more \u201cknown,\u201d to be more, do more, more, more, more. We\u2019re unwilling to accept our lot. We\u2019re unwilling to be grateful because we\u2019re constantly chasing the next thing.\nI was stuck in that cycle for years. 2020 was an awakening for many of us. I realized simple was the key. I realized that I had wasted time comparing myself with others and reading others\u2019 ideas on how to fix my unique problems.\nIt\u2019s empowering to solve your problems yourself, rather than look for a guidebook. It\u2019s harder, but much more fulfilling, to figure things out on your own. I used to fall apart at the smallest problems. I\u2019ve now come to enjoy solving the puzzles that life throws my way.\nLook at other people as inspiration, as \u201cexpanders,\u201d rather than as competition. Yes, others may be doing what you want to do, but why is that threatening? Why not see it as inspiration?\nIf they can do it, so can you, but do it in your own way. Don\u2019t seek to copy others. Find your own flair on the path to your dreams!\nThanks for reading! \u2764\nReach out to me with questions/feedback: razanecherk@gmail.com.

Illing pointed to Steve Bannon, a purveyor of information chaos, to describe what happens: To counteract the narrative of reality, Bannon reportedly said in 2018, is to \u201cflood the zone with shit.\u201d Overwhelming information exhausts people, Illing noted. This weariness leads people to retreat to comfortable ideological sides, he continued, or simply \u201cabandon the idea that the truth is knowable.\u201d\nThat flood wouldn\u2019t be possible without social platforms. This has meant that reaction to the shit-flood tactic has been largely to demand that social platforms stop it. Mark Zuckerberg, the head of Facebook, has famously been hauled in front of lawmakers more than once to answer for the garbage that spreads mostly unencumbered on the social platform he created. So has Twitter\u2019s Jack Dorsey. Occasionally, the platforms take action. In late August, for instance, Twitter shut down viral pro-Trump accounts purporting to be lifelong Black Democrat voters who\u2019d flipped to the Republican side because of the Black Lives Matter movement. Earlier in the month, Facebook removed or restricted hundreds of QAnon conspiracy-affiliated groups across its platforms.\nBut eliminating accounts or restricting groups doesn\u2019t get to the real problem, which is not about content but about the information sphere writ large that we\u2019ve constructed \u2014 and what that means for our understanding of the world. Simply put, we have an information sequencing problem, in that any rational sequence of information has been destroyed. And this means everything turns to shit.\nWe Don\u2019t Need Social Media\nInstead of wishing for better kinds of social platforms, we should question if they\u2019re worth having at allonezero.medium.com\nBack in 1972, media theorist Marshall McLuhan diagnosed the problem this way: In the 19th century, we lived in a visual space, which he described as \u201ccontinuous, uniform, connected, and static.\u201d It is a space that\u2019s linear and logical: One thing follows from another. For a long time, we considered this space to be \u201cnormal, natural, rational,\u201d McLuhan said. But that all ended with the advent of information traveling at electric speed \u2014 when we created an environment of \u201csimultaneous and instantaneous information.\u201d Our current experience, McLuhan said, is now not visual, but \u201cacoustic,\u201d which is \u201cdiscontinuous, disconnected, non-uniform, and dynamic.\u201d\nIn this world, \u201celectric information arrives from all quarters of the globe,\u201d and old informational structures have collapsed, along with any established point of view or perspective (or the ability to create one). Information in an acoustic environment is no longer rational or linear. Our acoustic world, McLuhan said, is one in which \u201cthere are no familiar boundaries\u2026 no sequence. There is no logic.\u201d\nWe\u2019ve created a world that is not merely run on information, but where there is nothing but information.\nThe simultaneous-instantaneous information environment, such as it was when McLuhan described it, has been exacerbated in the half century that\u2019s passed since his speech. Our immersion in the acoustic information sphere has deepened \u2014 not just in terms of the media we consume, but in the way our lives have been transformed into data.\nTo varying degrees, nearly everything we do has become information. The social platforms through which we understand our society are the most obvious example (we\u2019ll get back to those in a moment), but many of our interactions with the world, including with our friends and family, are purely informational \u2014 texts, video chats, and so on. We have even turned our bodies into informational streams, monitoring our movements and heartbeats, generating a readout of our sleep patterns. We\u2019ve created a world that is not merely run on information, but where there is nothing but information. This advanced acoustic existence positions us in a contextual tautology: When everything is information, information is everything. What this boils down to most of the time is that we tend to think the solution to every problem \u2014 even those created by too much information \u2014 is more information.\nTake democracy, for example, the very thing Steve Bannon appears to have sought to undermine. Arguably, it\u2019s vital that citizens understand their government and their role in shaping public policy. In recent years, the way we\u2019ve collectively decided to facilitate that knowledge is to demand transparency. Most of the time, this has meant governments dump data via \u201copen government\u201d initiatives, including accessible public databases like those that reveal salaries and program spending. So, we now know a lot more about what the government does than we might have a few decades ago, but I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll have noticed that the government is no better understood by the broad population. Why?\nLet\u2019s assume we\u2019ve demanded this transparency not for increased general understanding of government, but for simple accountability\u2019s sake (this is usually the reason). With more information, the thinking seems to go, we can hold public figures to account in the same way we might hold ourselves more accountable to a fitness regimen after monitoring our activity data for the day and realizing we were less active than we had assumed. It\u2019s a reality check. But within our acoustic informational sphere, how does that work? What happens when a reality check is applied to, say, Donald Trump?\nThe Dystopia Where Nothing Gets Cancelled\nWe\u2019re creating a marketplace of disinformationonezero.medium.com\nTrump says a lot of stuff that\u2019s misleading, erroneous, or simply false. The solution to this problem might seem to be to hold him accountable with contrasting information. Checking Trump\u2019s claims against other available data is a herculean effort and considered an admirable one by many. But while this exercise is, for the fact-checker, instructional, for everyone else, it\u2019s a bit like creating a negative of a film print \u2014 it\u2019s information duplication. At the end of the day, it\u2019s all the same thing.\nTo this you might argue, \u201cBut one thing is fact and the other is not.\u201d But in an acoustic space, there is no way to establish facts as different than anything else. If information comes from everywhere all at once and is non-sequential, then we have rendered facts, which rely on a linear structure, essentially moot, or at least irrelevant.\nWe tend to think the solution to every problem \u2014 even those created by too much information \u2014 is more information.\nThis is most obviously the case on social media, currently the dominant channel through which our society is understood and interpreted (though it is replicated on others like TV). That\u2019s because social media projects the structure of the acoustic sphere in a purist sense, in that it achieves a kind of information totality. While we don\u2019t see a series of zeros and ones every time we open Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or other platforms, everything presented on them is nonetheless reflective of the underlying acoustic structure. Logging on to the platform is to experience the world of data, in that it reduces everything to a binary stream.\nAs much as Mark Zuckerberg would like us to consider his platform as a place to have open and honest discussion \u2014 a free speech zone \u2014 it is by design, something much different. \u201cThe radical difference between the infrastructure overseen by Mark Zuckerberg and George Gallup in the 1930s is that we can all now potentially act as the pollster. Here\u2019s my dog: like or dislike? Donald Trump is a fascist: agree or disagree?\u201d William Davies wrote in August in the London Review of Books. \u201cThis is not the idealised classical or liberal public sphere of argument and deliberation, but a society of perpetual referendums.\u201d\nThis means that in our current world, as McLuhan theorized, answers come before the questions. Or, as Davies wrote, we are \u201cprivileging decision first and understanding second.\u201d We could even go further than that: Understanding is actually impossible in a situation where sequence is destroyed and logic is absent. Facts become meaningless. Nobody is accountable. There are no goals. In our world, there is no distinction between good information and bad information, there is only information. In place of understanding, we are left with a deep sense of uncertainty, making A-B choices about the world like a simple algorithm \u2014 in a sense becoming information, ourselves.\nDoes this mean it\u2019s useless to try to combat the likes of Steve Bannon or other intentional shit creators? Yes and no. If the goal is to marginalize hate speech and conspiracy theories, then de-platforming has been shown to be effective. When was the last time anyone heard from Alex Jones, Gavin McInnes, or Paul Joseph Watson? Without mainstream channels to broadcast their message, these individuals have been effectively silenced from the conversation. Equally, it\u2019s possible that shutting down anti-BLM bot networks and curtailing the spread of QAnon groups might mean fewer people get sucked into those specific regions of localized online chaos.\nBut these actions don\u2019t mean that other information is any more decipherable or logical or sequential. We shouldn\u2019t wonder why eliminating unwanted information does little to improve the information we do want. The underlying structure \u2014 our acoustic world \u2014 remains the same.

Image via screenshot.\nIn a video posted online earlier this week, a JetBlue pilot speaks over his plane\u2019s intercom to the passengers. \u201cI\u2019ve been going up and down this coast, from South Florida to New York for about 35 years,\u201d he tells them. \u201cI\u2019ve worked through the blackout, 9\u201311, all the storms, the crazy stuff, it\u2019s kind of a crazy world. We just got an announcement a few minutes ago\u2026at this moment, if you choose to, you may remove your mask.\u201d\n\u201cYeah!\u201d the camera-holder, a passenger, shouts. Other cries of \u201cwoo!\u201d can be briefly heard. The video is one of a handful that circulated in the hours following a decision by a federal judge in Florida who, in ruling on a lawsuit filed by an anti-masking group against President Joe Biden, struck down the Center for Disease Control\u2019s mask mandate for public transit.\nWhy do people think wearing a mask is the end of everything?\nI suspect part of why flight crews are happy the mask mandate is lifted \u2014 for now \u2014 is that they hated having to enforce it with unruly passengers. And while most people did as they were asked, we can all admit that wearing one kinda sucks. Not wearing one also sucked for a while in most places, because it meant you were suddenly barred from doing things you\u2019d always done. Whether you\u2019re pro-mask (me) or anti-mask (if such a binary really exists), we all know the whole thing is kind of a hassle.\nA lot\u2019s been written about the mask-as-signifier during this pandemic, but when you get down to it, this is the underlying source of complaint about masks from everyone (and everyone complains about them): they introduce a level of inconvenience into our lives. But objectively, for a lot of people, that inconvenience has been small. So why does it feel so big? Why does wearing a mask feel to some like authoritarianism or social collapse? Why do people think wearing a mask is the end of everything?\nThree years ago, around the time JetBlue introduced facial recognition check-in, I noted the impacts we experience by holding convenience as our most treasured shared value. And we do regard it that way. When pressed, we\u2019ll value convenience above even the most treasured aspects of our society. We\u2019ll choose convenience even if it means it will undermine equality, privacy and democracy \u2014 not to mention public health.\nTo repeat myself a bit, convenience explains a lot of our decisions, from those that seem mostly inconsequential all the way to those that will have a lasting impact on our lives and those of our communities. Convenience is why we listen to playlists but not albums; why we see some products online and not others; why we have things like biometric scans to board airplanes; why we\u2019ve relinquished our privacy in so many ways without much fight. If you\u2019re bothered by being tracked online, by scanning your face online, or by endlessly flipping through similar choices on Netflix, convenience is to blame. In many ways, convenience explains why we\u2019ve come to live in a world we hate.\nMy convenience will often create someone else\u2019s hell.\nUnderlying this tendency to value convenience so highly is a strong sense of both inherited and reinforced entitlement, encouraged via decades of effective consumerist messaging: we (or some of us) are supposed to have things easy. More specifically: you, at an individual level, are supposed to have things easy. This personalized aspect of convenience, that it applies to each of us singularly is how things can get very weird collectively. Is it more convenient for me, a white middle-class male, to board a plane using facial recognition? Yes! Is it more convenient for me, a generally healthy 30-something, to forego wearing a mask? Again, yes. But my convenience manifests inconveniences for others not in my position. My convenience will often create someone else\u2019s hell.\nConvenience \u2014 and particularly this aspect of it \u2014 is why some changes happen and others do not. Convenience reinforces a fundamental status quo. In most cases, it\u2019s one that favours those with consumer power. The more you consume, the more convenience you purchase, and the more you begin to expect things to be easy for you by default. Convenience becomes understood by those who can afford it as a natural state. This is why masks have become such a powerful symbol for a certain (white, middle-to-upper class) sector of the population. Masks are inconvenient, therefore unnatural.\nWhich should make us wonder will happen when actual natural things, like the ecosystems we inhabit, create significant inconveniences that are immune to consumer capacity?\nIt\u2019s simplistic to say that climate change will be inconvenient. Obviously. The predicted shift our climate will undergo over the next few decades will introduce multiple small and large changes to our lives, many (if not all) of which will force us to deviate from what we consider to be normal. Life, in both small and big ways, will become more difficult. Those inconveniences will hit some \u2014 poorer, older, younger, living in underdeveloped nations, in areas of existing weather extremes, with preexisting health conditions, etc. \u2014 harder and faster than they will hit others. But eventually, it will come for us all.\nI\u2019d like to think that at some point, we will begin to realize that convenience \u2014 our most treasured social value \u2014 should be reevaluated. That we might decide to use democracy to multiply the kind of moral policies that undercut individual convenience for the sake of collective progress and survival. Or, even more simply, that we each might learn that what\u2019s easy for us is also often what\u2019s damaging for everyone else.\nBut then I look at those passengers cheering the end of a mask mandate amidst the sixth wave of a pandemic that has killed millions and realize that we will likely continue to demand that we are given either convenience or death. And in the short term, we\u2019ll still get convenience. Today, tomorrow, next week.

Art?", "content": "Why Do We Need A.I. Art?\nOpenAI\u2019s DALL-E 2\u2018s impressive drawings bolster a theory that computers are better than humans \u2014 that\u2019s a lie.\nDo you want to see an image of teddy bears mixing sparkling chemicals as mad scientists in a steampunk style? Next question: How many do you want? DALL-E 2, the upgraded artificial intelligence imagery program from OpenAI that can create unique images merely from written descriptions, can provide as many as you need. It can also show those bears doing the same in different styles \u2014 say that of a 1990s Saturday morning cartoon. Is it perfect? Take a look:\nAn image DALL-E 2 created based on a prompt. At first glance, it\u2019s impressive, but the details reveal weird mistakes: Why do their paws meld together? What\u2019s going on in the spaces below their arms? Etc.\nThe answer is clearly no, it\u2019s not perfect.* But it\u2019s not bad.\nDALL-E 2 can also be prompted to imitate images that already exist, like a picture of a shop window or home interiors. Here\u2019s an example of what it comes up with:\nA rendering of a store from DALL-E 2, based on a photo of a real store. This looks good, but how does that door work? What\u2019s up with the windows?\nLike other artificial intelligence programs released in recent years, like ones that produce images of non-existent people or that write entire newspaper columns on their own, DALL-E 2 brings us close to the uncanny \u2014 something we know to be unreal but that could be real. Interestingly, what makes DALL-E 2\u2019s images uncanny, and thus reveal its mechanical nature, are its imperfections.\nUnfinished lines colliding with others, doors that we can see wouldn\u2019t actually work, surfaces blending together \u2014 these are all evidence that DALL-E 2\u2019s images, good as they are, still remain some distance from rendering a world as we know and live it. Human-made drawings would also contain mistakes, but DALL-E\u2019s mistakes are ones humans wouldn\u2019t make. Inaccuracy is a sign of human touch \u2014 but only certain kinds of inaccuracies: intelligent ones. The DALL-E 2 images are good, but the imperfections are a tell. It\u2019s just \u2018guessing\u2019 because it doesn\u2019t really \u2018know\u2019. This isn\u2019t intelligence after all, it\u2019s just covering its ass.\nAs it happens, DALL-E 2 can also mimic artistic style, arguably one of the most obvious showcases of human creative touch. Among the examples of art OpenAI used as a prompt from which DALL-E 2 could extrapolate was Georges Seurat\u2019s A Sunday on La Grande Jatte, one of the most famous modernist paintings:\n\nHere are a couple of DALL-E 2\u2019s mimickry results:\n\n\nSeurat\u2019s massive canvas, which he completed in 1886, is famous for its style as much as its fascinating figures. It\u2019s probably the best-known example of divisionism \u2014 more commonly known as pointilism. The logic of the technique was based on the assumption that colour points applied separately to build an image would create maximum luminosity \u2014 more, anyway, than mixing the paints together beforehand. The approach was semi-scientific, and gave a nod to the burgeoning mechanical age of the late 19th Century. It was also a general rejection of the dominant Impressionist trend in French art.\nSeurat\u2019s art, \u201cwas not\u2026about pure sensation, or self-expression, or improvisation,\u201d New York Times art critic Holland Cotter explained in 2004. \u201cIt was, instead, an un-Romantic exercise in measurement, objectivity, logic, control, with formal decisions made and conceptually resolved before brush touched canvas.\u201d La Grande Jatte, \u201cwas a masterpiece of applied mechanics.\u201d A bit like the product of a computer, you could say.\nSeurat\u2019s contemporary critics noted this mechanical trait. \u201cStrip his figures of the coloured fleas with which they are covered, and underneath there is nothing, no soul, no thought, nothing,\u201d French novelist and art critic Joris-Karl Huysmans huffed about La Grande Jatte a year after its completion. \u201cI am decidedly afraid that there is only too much process, too many systems here, and not enough of the flame that ignites, not enough life!\u201d\nI don\u2019t bring up these criticisms of Seurat to dismiss them or to suggest that any similar criticisms of computer (or AI)-generated art will one day be seen as silly or wrong. Instead, I think it\u2019s important to remember what they suggest about the hierarchical relationship between human and machine capability: that there is one, and we\u2019re on top.\nAs artificial intelligence systems get better \u2014 or as their outputs become more accurate and/or impressive \u2014 we are at risk of flipping for good the relationship between ourselves and the machines, if we\u2019re not most of the way there already.\nThere\u2019s a general sense in our society that our modern computers verge on being all-powerful and we have become increasingly willing to resign ourselves mostly uncritically to their information and their solutions. I worry this has led us to believe not only that their \u201cintelligence\u201d borders on consciousness (it doesn\u2019t) but, that we equally assume the surpassing of our own intelligence is inevitable. We measure ourselves against the computer more and more using a lower and lower bar to assess what counts as a win: that whatever we can do, the computer can do better. We may think we\u2019re training our machines to imitate us, but things inevitably end up the other way around.\nDALL-E 2\u2019s images are interesting and they reflect the instructions they were given. But they\u2019re not art, nor are they even really original. Ultimately, they show us what we have shown them. The computer cannot out-imagine us. So why do we need them? I think this is what Huysmans was getting at all those years ago when he criticised Seurat: Why would you limit yourself to thinking as a machine?

Recent history shows it could work.\n\n\u201cWant to see a $5 million house here in Vancouver?\u201d Canadian Conservative MP Pierre Poilievre asks at the start of a recent video. \u201cFeast your eyes on the home of your dreams,\u201d he says as the camera pans and he stands in front of a small, slightly dilapidated bungalow. His point, which he makes over the next five minutes \u2014 albeit with some questionable math \u2014 is pretty simple and obvious: no house that looks like this should cost this much. More to the point: if he ends up as Prime Minister one day, it won\u2019t.\nIt\u2019s a message delivered surprisingly well. I say surprisingly because up until the point that he announced his intention to run for leadership of the federal Conservatives, Poilievre\u2019s communication style was abrasive and off-putting. It was sneering and simplistic, often borderline juvenile \u2014 endless trolling and dunking. This behaviour matched the rest of his personal aesthetic, which is that of a smirking, know-it-all dweeb. While he was never to be wholly dismissed because, let\u2019s face it, that kind of internet-addled brain-worm vibe gets a lot of attention these days, it still relegated him to the level of your average aggrieved newsletter writer \u2014 with probably a similar sized audience.\nBut now here he is now talking more or less like a normal person? Unexpected. So unexpected that a lot of people seemed unsure of how to deal with it. On its face, his promise to bring down housing prices so much that a house currently listed for $4.8 million in Vancouver will be affordable to the average person is mostly bullshit, most of all due to federal jurisdiction limitations. The wake following his video\u2019s release was roiling with the finer details about municipal zoning permits and provincial regulatory responsibilities, as various experts and economists weighed in on the validity of Poilievre\u2019s proposed approach.\nAll of which are important to note. But, I\u2019d argue, more importantly: who cares?\nWhen Poilievre announced his intention to run for party leader, he offered a similar argument about affordability. Big Government, he said in his campaign launch video, has spent wildly and devalued paycheques. \u201cMore 30 year-olds live in their parents\u2019 basements because they can\u2019t afford the now-typical cost of a home,\u201d he intoned, arguing that a financial elite buys that real estate to create a permanent rentier class. A poll released Wednesday gauged people\u2019s reaction to the video. It resonated well, broadly speaking, including with Liberal and NDP voters \u2014 and young people.\nAgreement with a message doesn\u2019t equal votes \u2014 for party leadership or anything else. The next federal election, now expected in 2025 due to a working agreement between the Liberals and NDP that will keep the former\u2019s minority in power until then, is a long way off. A lot can change, but effective early and consistent messaging matters. Few would know this better than the person currently sitting in the Prime Minister\u2019s Office, Justin Trudeau.\nI don\u2019t want to draw these parallels too resolutely, but something feels vaguely familiar about all this. The size of early crowds Poilievre is attracting coincides with a palpable sense of weariness with (if not hatred of) the incumbent Liberal government, along with a willingness to attach blame to it for many things either beyond its reach or simply beyond reason. It would be wrong to suggest things now are exactly the same in the lead-up to the 2015 election, but\u2026 well, here we are.\nI get stuck on the messaging. Again, not on its details, but its style of seemingly deliberate intangibility.\nBack in 2014, the Trudeau Liberals unveiled what was to be both their campaign and governing slogan for the next few years: \u201cFor the middle class and those looking to join it\u201d. Well into the Trudeau Liberals\u2019 first government, a lot of people were still spending a lot of time debating what it meant to be \u201cmiddle class.\u201d Who is the middle class? Who qualifies for it and how? Where do they live? On and on and on. Every wonk and wag in Ottawa and beyond had their say.\nAnd precisely nobody gave a shit.\nThe \u201cmiddle class\u201d was about belonging \u2014 a key element in the Canadiana revivalist nature of the 2015 Trudeau campaign. But it was also about having that to which you feel entitled placed within your reach. Affordability is the new middle class. And Pierre Poilievre is talking about in a way that makes people want to listen.

I didn\u2019t ask her name for a long time. If I knew her name that would make her a real person who slept with my husband without a thought for his wife or his two young sons. In my grief was a speck of doubt that this was really happening and that my husband was walking out of our front door after sixteen years to be with her.\nHe came back to me twice, the guilt of leaving his family behind weighing on him, but he never stopped seeing her. I sent him to a hotel when we didn\u2019t connect again. I told him to stay there and figure out what he really wanted so he could stop wasting everyone\u2019s time. I prayed he would pick me, but the hotel he stayed at ended up being his new girlfriend\u2019s apartment.\nWhen I found out, I screamed at him for the first time in my life, my voice cracking as I called him every bad name I could come up with. I said he was a walking midlife crisis, a cliche and a sexual harassment suit because she\u2019d been the receptionist in his office when he started sleeping with her.\nOne of the times we were together after the initial breakup, I asked him questions about her. I was starving for information, needing to know every last detail about this girl who replaced me.\n\u201cWhat color is her hair?\u201d I asked him.\n\u201cPink,\u201d my husband replied proudly, clearly still smitten. He was always so easily impressed. There was no way I could compete with this girl who made him feel cool and young again. He bragged about going to clubs, staying out all night and then hitting Denny\u2019s at 3:00 a.m. It was clear he felt cheated by the years he spent with me and was making up for lost time.\nThey moved in together permanently after the last time he left me. By this time, she had a name, Michaela. I looked up her full name on the Internet and found a few pictures of her. She had tattoos and the aforementioned pink hair, but her face was plain, almost homely. Still, she made my husband feel alive again, and I couldn\u2019t compete with that.\nWhen I filed for divorce, I drove to my husband\u2019s office to give him the news knowing she would be there. She was sitting at a desk in the front, and when she saw me her body stiffened and her jaw dropped. When I asked to speak to my husband, she barely squeaked out \u201cone moment, please.\u201d I decided I liked her being scared of me.\nI remember my husband appeared from his office almost instantly as if he was a fireman rushing to put out a five alarm. When we were in the elevator, I turned to him with a guilty smile.\n\u201cSorry, had to be done.\u201d\nHe nodded his head. He understood it could have been much worse. He\u2019d gotten off easy.\nThere were days I had to drop off the boys to them, my new ex-husband and his mistress. His patio was visible from the street, so I got a bird\u2019s-eye view of Michaela interacting with my sons, playing with their toys and hugging them as they squirmed. If she dared to look at me in my car as I drove away, she got the pleasure of my middle finger as I squealed out of my parking space.\nShe came for my husband, and now she had my boys. I wished for horrible things to happen to her. I wanted Derek to cheat on her as he did to me and break her black scummy heart. She took my place at the weekly Sunday dinner at his mother\u2019s house. One night my ex-mother-in-law took pity on me and invited me over instead when her son and Michaela wouldn\u2019t be there because the girl was sick.\n\u201cGood,\u201d I said with my pain still fresh. \u201cI hope she dies.\u201d\nHe told me during a conversation about the boys. Michaela was having bad headaches, and the doctors found out there was a tumor behind her right eye. She had to have a biopsy.\n\u201cWe hope it\u2019s benign,\u201d my ex said. \u201cIf it is, we\u2019re going to get matching tattoos to celebrate.\u201d\nI didn\u2019t respond. I was sure it would be benign. Michaela was in her twenties, and her luck seemed incredible in every other way. She\u2019d lucked into my husband and my family and basically my entire life. What more did she want?\nThe tumor wasn\u2019t benign. It was cancer that spread throughout her body, including her bones. I told my ex-husband how sorry I was. I still hated the girl, but the news floored me. How could somebody face death when she had her whole life ahead of her? As much as I wanted her out of our sons\u2019 lives, I honestly didn\u2019t want her to actually die.\nThe doctors gave Michaela weeks to live. I found out she\u2019d also had cancer as a child, and they believed it was a resurgence from that episode. My ex kept me posted on her condition, not because I wanted to know but so he could have somebody to talk to about it. I struggled to put my feelings aside and be as supportive as I could, but listening to details about her made me feel like throwing up.\nI\u2019d carried my hate for her around like a shield for so long that I was used to the weight. During that time, I no longer wished for my husband to come back to me. He wasn\u2019t the loving man I\u2019d once known. In fact, he seemed like a completely different person, and I knew we were no longer compatible. Still, with the death of that dream, my feelings about Michaela never wavered. She\u2019d stolen my family without a second thought\u2026 period. That made her enemy number one, and that would never change even if I was ready to move on by myself.\nIt was a Saturday night when my little boys came to me. They stood next to each other at the foot of my bed looking sad and confused.\n\u201cDid you know Michaela is going to die?\u201d my older son, Brendan, asked me.\n\u201cYes I do,\u201d I answered quietly.\nThe boys looked at each other, then back at me. It was the first time I\u2019d thought of the effect Michaela\u2019s death would have on them. She was there on weekends when the boys were with their father. She played with them and cuddled them and gently teased them. Now she was about to disappear from their lives while they were too little to understand.\nMy younger son, Shayne, piped up. \u201cIs she going to be a beautiful angel in heaven? That\u2019s what dad told us.\u201d\nI swallowed my anger and sarcasm, and it tasted bitter on my tongue.\n\u201cYes she is,\u201d I told my son as he wriggled his way into my lap.\nThe boys were full of questions. Does Michaela have to die? Can\u2019t a doctor save her? What if we wished really hard? Can we pray to Jesus?\nIn their world, people didn\u2019t just go away forever. In their innocent eyes, there was always hope. Except this time there wasn\u2019t any. My heart broke to see their confusion and helplessness.\nI scooped up both boys in my arms. \u201cWhat if we made something to help her feel better?\u201d\nTheir faces lit up, excited to help. The boys followed me into the kitchen. I pulled a basket from the top shelf of the pantry and lined it with bright red tissue paper.\n\u201cWhat do you guys think would make her happy?\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d Shayne shouted. He ran off in the direction of his room and came back with a small stuffed monkey. It was one of his favorites. He knelt down and set it into the basket tenderly. Then he stood up and turned back to me.\n\u201cWhat else?\u201d\nBrendan and Shayne each drew her pictures we stuffed into colorful envelopes and put in the basket. I put in some Clinique moisturizer I hadn\u2019t opened yet along with a small African Violet plant I\u2019d been looking after. A few more stuffed animals made the basket nearly overflow. The boys eagerly chatted about when they would give it to her and how surprised she would be.\nBefore we knew it, we were finished.\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t it need a card?\u201d Brendan asked me.\nI grabbed an index card and a Sharpie from my desk. The boys hovered over me around the dining room table.\n\u201cWhat should we write?\u201d I asked them.\n\u201cHow about get well soon?\u201d Shayne offered.\nI hugged my boy. Neither of them really understood how final this was.\n\u201cHow about\u2026we love you, Michaela?\u201d\n\u201cYeah!\u201d both boys shouted in unison. Brendan wrote it because he was the oldest and knew how to spell. Shayne added a smiley face and some X\u2019s and O\u2019s. We stood over the basket looking at our handiwork not saying anything. There would be time to have a real talk with them, but they were caught up that moment because they were helping Michaela feel better.\nThat was all that mattered, for all three of us.\nMichaela died about a month later at her father\u2019s house out of state. She told my ex to thank us for the basket which the boys told me she loved. My ex had a feeling it wasn\u2019t the stuffed animals and pictures she loved as much as the idea of a truce between us. He may have been right, but either way I was okay with it.\nI realized how much of my anger was misdirected. I blamed Michaela for blowing up my marriage when there were already leaks in the ship between me and my husband. She didn\u2019t owe me her loyalty when she met him. He\u2019s the one who made the promises on our wedding day, and in the end he was the one who broke them.\nIt hurts when somebody dies so young. Sometimes life seems so unfair, and I don\u2019t understand it just as much as my children didn\u2019t. In the end, though, putting aside my grievances doesn\u2019t make me a hero.

It\u2019s just the way I grew up. My mom and dad believed people should eat whatever and wherever they wanted. I don\u2019t think we even had a dinner table.\nMy husband, daughter and I used to have a coffee table, and we\u2019d sit there to eat in front of the TV. The distraction of the screen kept my husband and daughter from arguing about little and big things. Then, when the coffee table broke, we didn\u2019t replace it and started eating in the dining room. It was the perfect situation for Victoria and her dad to start antagonizing each other. When called upon to take a side, I\u2019d just put a bite of food in my mouth and hope they would forget.\nI made excuses for my husband. \u201cWell, he\u2019s just under a lot of stress.\u201d I made excuses for Victoria by reminding my hubby that she was only 15 and that we are the adults. Nothing I said made any of us feel better. I felt uncomfortable and couldn\u2019t eat. Then I\u2019d get up, rinse my plate and get the hell out of there.\nAt last night\u2019s dinner, Victoria shared her true feelings with us. She was talking about her final exams for ninth grade and how she was failing math. I shot my husband a guilty look, the same way he was looking at me.\n\u201cI wish I could help you more,\u201d I said in a weak voice. Victoria didn\u2019t buy it for one second. She showed me a paper with math problems on it. I felt ashamed that it all looked like it was in another language. I only got through tenth-grade math and haven\u2019t been able to help Victoria since she was little. I gave the paper back to her.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t figure it out either,\u201d my daughter sighed.\nWe tried to get her a math tutor at her school. Victoria really liked her but unfortunately, the lady quit a few weeks later over something else.\nNow, sitting at the table, Victoria was agitated.\n\u201cIt\u2019s your fault that I\u2019m failing,\u201d she announced. \u201cYou and dad were high school dropouts and each got a GED. You didn\u2019t bother to learn anything else. Why did you quit?\u201d\n\u201cYour Nana told me to drop out,\u201d I said, trying to defend myself.\nVictoria piped up. \u201cOnly because you used to skip every day and didn\u2019t do your work.\u201d\nShe had me there.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like The Butterfly Effect,\u201d she continued. \u201cThe choices you both made for your education are now affecting me. I can\u2019t go as far as I want to because of the way you planned out your life. You can\u2019t help me. I have to do it all by myself.\u201d\nI sat there in shock, glad that Victoria\u2019s father had left the room. He would have just blown up at her. I was actually trying to understand. It hurt like hell to hear how I failed my daughter. I could tell she had wanted to say this for a long time, and I wanted to pay attention now.\nI thought back to my own high school years. I had severe anxiety and depression that were as yet undiagnosed. It was hard for me to concentrate on math, too, so I started skipping that class. Nobody from the school really said everything about it, so I skipped at least two classes every day. Over time, I wouldn\u2019t show up for other classes along with math. I never got in trouble for it, which led to me becoming brazen about it.\nMy mom finally told me to drop out, get a job and pay her rent. I was pretty sure she was taking the bad advice of a friend who had recently taken her own daughter out of school and said how great it was. That being said, I didn\u2019t feel good about being a dropout. My mom\u2019s concern was mostly wanting the rent I was supposed to give her. Nothing was ever talked about. She just handed me the bill and that was that.\nMy mother\u2019s educational history was sketchy. She also suffered from mental illness, and my family has said she spent most of her teen years in a psychiatric hospital. That news was shocking. My mom was a very smart woman all her life. Was that even possible without school?\nI honestly don\u2019t think I\u2019m a dumb person. When I tried, my grades were always decent. Even now, I always have some kind of book in my hand. Victoria doesn\u2019t see any of that and referred to me as lazy. She was only partly wrong. With my blistering anxiety, I didn\u2019t want to be anywhere in public. I constantly waited for the other shoe to drop.\nThere wasn\u2019t much I could say to Victoria to make her feel better. I\u2019m not able to go back in time to fix my mistakes from 40 years ago. I assured her that I would do whatever I could to help with school, but I admitted I was pretty much useless when it came to math. Victoria said thanks, but it was also clear in her eyes what my shortcomings were. Parents want their kids to think of them as heroes, but Victoria was looking at me as a real person and not a hero, and it stung a bit.\nThe only thing I could do is admit the truth to her. Victoria had grown up from a premature baby to a tiny tough girl who spoke her mind. Even if I don\u2019t always like the results, I am proud of her for being able to express her feelings, and I\u2019ll always support her right to do so. Mistakes don\u2019t have to last forever, and I will help her find ways to get around them so she can go as far as she wants. She deserves much better than what I and even her grandmother had to deal with.\nI\u2019ll probably never enjoy the dinner table, but I\u2019m proud of my daughter and her honesty and desire to live out all of her goals. She\u2019s braver than I am. My past may have disappointed her, but now that I know, I have the chance to help where I can. She\u2019s the bravest girl I know and super smart and funny. I still carry the guilt I feel from letting her down, but I\u2019ll do whatever is in my power to help her along the way.", "comment_count": 32, "like_count": 1815, "created_time": 1651428601178, "comment": [{"user_id": "155e15569aa5", "comment_time": 1651428601178, "comment": "Thank you for sharing!"}, {"user_id": "b61df77828dc", "comment_time": 1651509841642, "comment": "It's actually NOT your fault, anymore than if you'd been raped or robbed or had to drop out of school because your mom got sick and needed you to work because of that.

I found it fascinating, the idea of people becoming rich and famous due to social media. It wasn\u2019t something I found relatable at all until they aired an episode a few years ago that was way too much like my old life.\nKim and Khloe were in Kim\u2019s closet where an exorbitant amount of clothes were taken off their hangers and dumped on the floor. When a horrified Khloe asks Kim what she\u2019s doing, Kim announces with a shrug that her boyfriend Kanye took everything out of her closet and replaced them with clothes HE wanted her to wear.\nIt was a red flag, right in her face and for the whole world to see, but she ended up marrying the guy who is now publicly stalking and abusing her. At a certain point in my life, I did the same thing.\nMy ex-husband stalked me for eight years. Although he never picked out my clothes, he controlled me in every other aspect. When we first met, he saw a little gray in my hair and told me that I needed to dye my hair blonde because he was too young to be seen with a woman with gray hair. Instead of telling him off, the next day I did what he said. It looked terrible on me, but if being blonde made him happy, I thought it was worth the sacrifice.\nI was wrong, of course. That incident was my red flag. The nervous feeling in my stomach knew it, but I didn\u2019t listen and went on to marry him and have his child. It was the most desperate time in my life, and I could have saved years of abuse by simply saying, \u201cI like my gray hair, piss off.\u201d Today it would be different, but back then I had nonexistent self-esteem and massive anxiety. I didn\u2019t think I was safe to be alone.\nThere are people who post memes about Kim and Kanye and laugh about how he is causing her emotional abuse and suffering. I\u2019m sure some don\u2019t realize what that kind of abuse looks like, but imagine having to go through that fear and knowing the whole world has an opinion on it. All of the heartache playing out on social media for everyone to see must make it even harder, especially when kids are involved.\nMy daughter was merely a pawn in my ex\u2019s sick game. He constantly used her to get to me and, even at age seven, she knew what he was doing. Eventually, about a year later, she told him to leave her alone, just as I should have done years ago. She was sad about it, but she also knew she did the right thing.\nHe tugged on my heartstrings that he couldn\u2019t often see his daughter because I wasn\u2019t willing to meet him and leave her alone with him. Even then, I still felt sorry for him, just like all the times I left him and he begged to come back. He called me hundreds of times and wouldn\u2019t stop when I didn\u2019t answer. I got a new phone, but somehow he got the number. His emails came just as often, calling me crazy and a whore and whatever else he could say to make me feel bad.\nWhen he started showing up at places I went, I applied for a restraining order. The judge denied it because he never hit me. I guessed he didn\u2019t believe in emotional abuse. A cop once asked me to get him to hit me so I could press charges, which I was too afraid to do. I stayed in a women\u2019s shelter for a while, but being away from him and safe didn\u2019t matter when he kept calling and calling and calling to get inside my mind.\nSadly, my ex died a few years ago in a train accident, although some say he did it on purpose. Despite the fact that I had divorced him and married somebody else by then, he stalked me all the way up to the last day of his life.\nI was still too angry to be sorry. Time has healed me quite a bit, but I remember the stalking like it was yesterday. It was relentless and scary and not the least bit flattering. However, I didn\u2019t think much about those days anymore until I saw Kanye constantly harassing his ex on the Internet where nobody seems to be able to stop him. People make fun of it, but it\u2019s not the least bit funny.\nI suffer from bipolar disorder, too, but I\u2019ve never hurt or stalked anyone. I know right from wrong. Being sick is not an excuse to do whatever you want, even if you\u2019re famous. Stalking is a dangerous game that can escalate at a moment\u2019s notice. The more Kim ignores Kanye, the worse he seems to get instead of getting the hint. I\u2019ve seen this before in my own life, and it still scares the hell out of me.\nI hope they both get the help they need.", "comment_count": 18, "like_count": 2140, "created_time": 1645805499535, "comment": [{"user_id": "155e15569aa5", "comment_time": 1645805499535, "comment": "Thank you for sharing!"}, {"user_id": "93162b83d3ad", "comment_time": 1646017070137, "comment": "It\u2019s interesting that reflection shows so clearly the red flags we ignored at the time.

In manic times, sometimes it just seemed like the perfect thing to do. Not to mention all the drugs in my system that made it easier to say yes. Getting a fresh tattoo was instant gratification. It buried all the sadness and guilt for a little while. Those things never lasted, unlike the tattoo.\nI didn\u2019t get my first tattoo until I was 36. My now-deceased ex-husband was covered with them, and he would constantly pester me to do the same. I\u2019m not sure if I thought it would make me look cooler, but now I look back and see how clearly I was going through pain and suffering on the inside but covering it up on the outside. My tattoos were a cry for help that nobody answered.\nThis particular night, I made an overexcited decision to have the Chinese word for peace tattooed on my ankle. I double and triple-checked to make sure I got the sign right, and then I went to the tattoo artist my ex-husband and I used. Anyone who wants a tattoo like this should know that it hurts like a bitch since the ankle was just bone on bone. I suffered anyway because I really wanted that word stamped on me.\nPeace.\nWhen I got it, I had no concept of this word. I didn\u2019t stop to think of what actual peace would look like in my life. I spent most of my time swirling through my toxic marriage and the drugs I took and the guilt of losing my children because my husband was so unkind to them. How arrogant was it to ask for peace after I ruined my life and everyone in it? Still, I wanted it more than anything. When I looked at my new tattoo afterward, all I saw was irony.\nA mutual friend once told my ex-husband, \u201cGlenna doesn\u2019t know who she is.\u201d When the ex repeated it to me, I felt ashamed because it was true. After a lifetime of troubles broke me down, I felt like I didn\u2019t know right from wrong or even what I stood for and believed. I would have to start from scratch to find this girl who was so hurt and forever lost.\nI started my journey by divorcing my husband. It was one of the biggest moves I would ever make after ten years of being told what to think, say and believe. He was relentless about trying to make me his prisoner again and stalked me to the point where I had to get a restraining order. Sadly, even though I was free, I still didn\u2019t know myself.\nI remarried a few years after that to the kindest man on the planet, but I continued to be haunted by guilt, anger, and sadness. There was so much rage over what was done to me that it stopped me from getting on with my life. I decided to write a book about the experience but didn\u2019t do much to promote it. Everything that was dying to get out of me burned on every page, and I began to heal as I wrote and acknowledged that I had been living selfishly in victim mode.\nWhen the book was finished, I didn\u2019t feel the same. All my anger at my ex-husband seemed to fall away. Of course, that didn\u2019t mean I ever wanted to see him again, but I wasn\u2019t full of rage anymore. The anger and guilt I directed at myself still existed, but it didn\u2019t hurt quite as much. I hoped others in similar situations who read it would discover that they also can get out of an abusive relationship and kick drugs on top of it. After that, when I would spot the book in my bookcase, it seemed like a lifetime ago written by someone I didn\u2019t know.\nI\u2019ve spent the last few years reading every self-help book I could get my hands on, trying to find some healing as I got from my own book. I read about anxiety, PTSD, depression, and almost every similar subject. Over time, with less drama in my life, I felt more content and confident. However, there was still something I knew I was missing.\nA good friend of mine has been trying to get me to read the same book for years. He\u2019s been nice about it, but I wrote it off (without reading it) as more mumbo-jumbo, self-help material that never really stuck with me. He sent the book to my house as a gift, where I promptly dumped it on my shelves with the promise to read it later. Today, I really wish I hadn\u2019t ignored him.\nNot long ago, I was listening to my favorite podcast by Glennon Doyle. She is tough and sweet and vulnerable, and I decided to stick with her as one of the few survivors of my self-help period. On this particular podcast, I heard her mention a line from one of her favorite books, The Untethered Soul by Michael Singer. What she read aloud that day blew me away.\n\u201cYou are not the voice full of shaming and anger and worrying every day,\u201d she said. \u201cThe real you is the one who listens to the voice.\u201d\nI almost pulled my car over to the side of the road. What Glennon read was like a bolt of lightning in my body. I\u2019d been digging and digging to try to \u201cfind myself,\u201d but I\u2019d been there the whole time, the one who listens. She was the girl that I had so desperately tried to find and save, but now I know she was saving me all those years.\nWhen I got home, I looked through my books to find the one that my friend gave me. The title sounded so familiar, and sure enough, it was the same book my friend had bought me. As I read through it, I realized that the worry, jealousy, and anger left in me weren\u2019t actually me. I was the one who listened and calmed those voices down that tried to make me crazy. For the first time, I felt a sense of power mixed with calm. All the things I worried about were just thoughts and feelings and not who I really was.\nI promptly called my book-giving friend to thank him and say I was sorry I didn\u2019t realize at first the life-changing gift he gave me.\n\u201cYou weren\u2019t ready then,\u201d he told me. \u201cYou are ready now.\u201d\nIt\u2019s hard to explain how calm I have been these days. It\u2019s a sensation I\u2019ve never felt before. I don\u2019t get mad over stupid stuff anymore, and I know what I want in my life. My family and a few friends mean everything to me. I don\u2019t push people away anymore, and I try to go out of my way to be kind where I can. My soul and my ankle tattoo are now in total alignment, even if I remember how childish and lost the girl was who got it.\nI\u2019m happy to see it now.

We live in a challenging and frightening time. It\u2019s easy to believe that the world is coming apart at the seams and we are powerless to stop it.\nWhat we are watching unfold in Ukraine feels especially dark: a tyrant swallowing up another country whole. The images of bombings, children seeking shelter, and fathers separated from fleeing families to fight the invasion is as heartbreaking as it is angering. As someone who works on issues related to armed conflict, some of the images I\u2019ve seen online present strong evidence of Russian war crimes.\nVladimir Putin may believe he knows how this ends, but history shows us that men who start wars rarely get to end them on their terms. War is hell and chaos. Some of us feel like we can\u2019t bear to look at another crisis. But bear witness we must. It is the most human thing we can do, both for the Ukrainian people and ourselves.\nSearching for wisdom and hope\nDr. Martin Luther King, Jr. once said \u201cinjustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.\u201d Sometimes it feels like those words have been repeated and misused so often that they\u2019ve lost their meaning. But they remain as true today as they were when Dr. King said them, especially when we seek to understand his context.\nDr. King once said those words near the end of a remarkable speech he gave not about civil rights, but against the Vietnam War. It\u2019s worth your time to read the whole speech, but here is a larger snippet:\n\u201cI have spoken in recent years before hundreds of thousands of young people in their colleges, in the slums, in churches and synagogues. Their comments and questions reflect a sharply rising body of opinion that the inability to influence government to adopt urgent reforms is not a consequence of any superficial ignorance, lethargy or prejudice, but is systemic. There is more serious discussion today about basic structural change in our society, that I can recall, over a decade\u2026\nIt is worth remembering that there is a strong strain of dissent in the American tradition even in time of war. During the Mexican War, the intellectual elite of the nation, Emerson, Thoreau and many others were withering critics of our national policy. In the Congress, a relatively unknown first term congressman made a scathing address on the floor denouncing that war. The young congressman was Abraham Lincoln of Illinois. At the same time a young army lieutenant, almost decided to resign his commission to protest the war. His name was Ulysses Grant. So we must keep dissent alive and not allow it to become another casualty of the war in Vietnam.\nAs I move to my conclusion, let me ask you to indulge a personal reference. When I first decided to take a firm stand against the war in Vietnam, I was subjected to the most bitter criticism, by the press, by individuals, and even by some fellow civil rights leaders. There were those who said that I should stay in my place, that these two issues did not mix and I should stick with civil rights. Well I had only one answer for that and it was simply the fact that I have struggled too long and too hard now to get rid of segregation in public accommodations to end up at this point in my life segregating my moral concerns.\nAnd I made it very clear that I recognized that justice was indivisible. Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.\u201d\n- Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., November 1967 at The National Labor Leadership Assembly for Peace\nI\u2019ve read a lot of Dr. King over the past 15 years, but this particular speech is one I keep coming back to for two reasons. First, it showcases the powerful gift he had for seeing the world around him for what it was and the people around him for who they were. Second, it highlights how he refused to look away from the pain and suffering that a mass injustice inflicts on everyone, even when others tried to shove him in a single lane and keep him there. It\u2019s this part of the speech that we see the two come together:\n..I have struggled too long and too hard now to get rid of segregation in public accommodations to end up at this point in my life segregating my moral concerns.\nI wish I had even half of that level of moral conviction. My fear is that I do not. I segregate my moral concerns daily. The white American in me whispers that I need to strike a balance. My human brain tempts me to anger that can easily give way to cause for inertia. The Christian part of me says I need to love.\nLove is a strange thing. The kind of love that Dr. King practiced is a love I admit I do not fully understand. It\u2019s a love that internalizes the brokenness of the world and still extends peace back into it. It\u2019s a love that forces one to see the deep connections between various forms of oppression, wrongdoing, and the harm caused by both. It\u2019s a love that speaks truth about those realities, even when it is incredibly painful and frustrating. The world gave Dr. King every reason to struggle for people who only looked like him, but he didn\u2019t stop there. He couldn\u2019t stop there. Christlike love made him keep going.\nInternalizing our moment\nDr. King was able to see the world around him for what it was and love did not allow him to walk away. He was constantly bearing witness, constantly internalizing what he was seeing and hearing before pushing back out into the world, not to control it, but to do what he could to try to change it.\nOur world today is both very different and very much the same as it was in Dr. King\u2019s time. It is tempting to look away, not to bear witness to what very well may be the end of an entire country against the will of her people. It is tempting to look away not only because it is horrifying, but because oppression is complex and so exhausting.\nAnd, if we\u2019re honest, it is tempting to look away because what is being inflicted on Ukraine we have our own echoes of here in the United States. This feels like it hits close to home because it does. Bearing witness helps us understand how and why and informs our response.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t yet understood how the toxic swirl of authoritarianism, nationalism, misuse of history, and disinformation leads to political aggression and false justifications for mass violence, that\u2019s understandable. These are complex, ever-evolving problems that even experts never stop studying. Dr. King didn\u2019t just speak. He also listened. He also watched. He was a student just as much as he was a teacher. I\u2019ve been studying the above problems within a narrow context via my day job for well over a decade now. Most days I feel like I\u2019ve still only scratched the surface.\nLike Dr. King, we should always be growing in our mindfulness of how these oppressions and dangers interact with the broader culture and our lives. Doing so can help us become less susceptible to fear-mongering, hate, and othering and more in tune with truth, justice, and discernment. With regards to how these dangers intersect in Ukraine, here are a few places to start:\nPutin's invasion of Ukraine, explained\nRussia's long-looming invasion of Ukraine has officially begun. Russian President Vladimir Putin announced Thursday\u2026www.vox.com\nPutin's \"Nazi\" rhetoric reveals his terrifying war aims in Ukraine\nAs Russian bombs pound Ukraine, and its soldiers pour into Ukrainian territory, the question on everyone's mind is\u2026www.vox.com\nNext year in Kyiv?\n(RNS) - While the secular media tries to guess Vladimir Putin's motives in Ukraine, one important aspect of the current\u2026religionnews.com\nIt\u2019d be delusional to read any of this and fail to see parallels in our own country. We\u2019re not immune from these dark tendencies in the United States, although they certainly have their own flavor here. Authoritarianism exists in both our major political parties (albeit much more dangerously on the political right). Nationalism is embedded so deeply in many of our churches that some genuinely believe it is authentic Christianity. We misuse, twist beyond recognition, and outright hide our country\u2019s own history for the comfort of the powerful. And misinformation and disinformation swirl around us like toxic fumes, poisoning our minds and pushing us deeper into ideological bubbles.\nThese realities have been a part of who we are since before our country was even born. We saw all four on full display during the January 6 insurrection. It\u2019s why the American far-right has an affinity for Vladimir Putin. There\u2019s nothing odd about it. It\u2019s always been there. If you have eyes to see it, it is impossible not to see it.\nBut somehow, through it all, we\u2019re still here. I can only prayerfully hope our growing knowledge of the deep challenges we face and the oppressors lurking behind them prepares us to resist any authoritarian that demands blind loyalty in the pursuit of treating fellow human beings as threats to be destroyed. We live in challenging times, but we all face the same choice: pursuing justice, or living without it. Justice anywhere can help bring justice everywhere.\nWe may not be able to stop the crimes being unleashed upon Ukraine and her people right now; however, if we are to take Dr. King seriously, then we will see the same types of aggressions and oppressions in our own country and our own communities. We can see how they connect to injustice elsewhere. And we can see that it is the marginalized and vulnerable who suffer the most, be they in the United States or in Ukraine or in Russia.\nLike Dr. King, we must bear witness to our times so we are capable of finding a path through to something better. I am more certain than ever before that this decade is going to be rough, but the end that the oppressors of our world seek is not inevitable. In our own lives, we must speak against and seek to end oppression as far as it is found. When we do, we help create space for others to do the same.\nAnd we must find hope in the truth that, as we participate in the best humanity has to offer, what appears to be dark, powerful, and unchangeable are shown to be none of those things when they finally collapse upon themselves.\nI explore faith, culture, and empathy from Memphis, TN.

Many of our neighbors and most of my peers at the public high school I attended had churches to call home. Some of my earliest and fondest memories are rooted at my childhood church. Such was life in the American South.\nFast forward to today and we find ourselves in a different world. The precipitous decline in church attendance we see in survey data bears out anecdotally in my lived experience. A majority of my Christian friends no longer identify with a local church. Most of the rest have left one church for another during the last several years. And while many of my non-Christian friends think Jesus is pretty cool, plenty of them believe that most churches don\u2019t take him seriously. My Christian friends tend to agree.\nMany who left a church did so because they were made to feel like it was the only option available to them. They long to call a local church home; however, they see similar bad experiences bleeding out of other churches in their community. Coupled to a toxic mixture of cultural elitism masquerading as Gospel truth and abuse or unkindness at their previous church, they have been given plenty of reasons not to risk stepping into a new space.\nBut the deep desire to be part of a vibrant, Jesus-centered and outward looking faith community often remains, sometimes persisting for years. It\u2019s why so many who leave a church heartbroken and abused long for another faith community to help make them whole again.\nI have a great deal of empathy for those who have been burned by a church. After working in the nonprofit sector for over a decade, I\u2019ve met some genuinely fantastic, engaged faith communities. I\u2019ve also been misled by others, with promises of support never materializing and doors promised to be opened staying shut. And roughly this time last year, our family departed a church we thought we\u2019d be wed to for life. By the time we left, things were so broken beyond repair that leaving on decent terms wasn\u2019t possible.\nAs the saying goes, I have the receipts.\nThere was a time when I felt like never stepping foot in a church again. Much of the church culture in my neck of the words is aggressively consumerist and in decline. Finding a joyful church that was trying to follow Jesus and love their neighbors magnanimously felt like it\u2019d be akin to searching for a needle in a haystack. For months, I met up with various Christian friends and acquaintances who were in a similar place to try to figure things out together. It wasn\u2019t an easy time, but I saw more spiritual growth in this time than I did over the last decade.\nIf you had told me back then that a year later we would have a new church home, I probably would have rolled my eyes. But that\u2019s what happened. Some of the most common questions I get from readers are how do I know when I\u2019m ready to try church again? and where do I even begin? I want to share a few of our experiences and things we learned on this journey. None of this should be considered prescriptive, just a description of what things looked like for us.\nPhoto by Josh Applegate on Unsplash\nHow I knew it was time to try, again\nThere wasn\u2019t a single moment when I thought to myself I\u2019m ready to find a new church! My wife was ready before I was. It took me a lot of processing past experiences, conversations with friends and family, reading books, writing, listening to podcasts and more to begin considering a new relationship with a local church. There are two areas worth touching on for our purposes here.\nFirst, I came to terms with the uncomfortable reality that for much of my life, I\u2019ve been misled concerning who God is, what the local church is supposed to be and how Christians are supposed to live. I wasn\u2019t innocent either, having misled myself every time I knew something was off, but didn\u2019t question it enough or as early as I should have. I\u2019ve written about this before, so I won\u2019t rehash it all here:\nMy Church Deconstruction Is Ending\nSome lessons learned during a season of uncertaintymedium.com\nI\u2019m still working through all the nuances of these lessons; however, even though I began rejecting large parts of the white American evangelical subculture years ago, my staying in it made me complicit. I had chosen to be part of an anomaly in broader Church history that was straying from Jesus and had little to no interest in reform. Once I started the process of repentance, I became less resistant to seeking out a new church to call home.\nSecond, this process helped me learn more about the many other thriving traditions in the Christian faith. I read and listened to Anglicans, black Pentecostals, Catholics, Episcopalians, Mennonites, Methodists, Presbyterians and global evangelicals, the latter of whom are often very different from white American evangelicals. I discovered that many of the negative things I had been told about these traditions just weren\u2019t true.\nI finally saw the global Church for more of what it actually is. I was naturally drawn to various parts of these traditions. I witnessed a lot more humility and sincerity toward Jesus and Scripture in all of them. I saw less of the cultural elitism common in white American evangelical spaces. At some point, my resistance gave way to a real desire to be a part of this church, the global one.\nWhere we began\nAll of this delivered a freedom and desire to find a new faith community. Similar to a lot of you reading this though, our family immediately ran into the where do we even begin looking for a church question, for two reasons.\nThe first stemmed from our own cultural baggage. We came out of an inward-looking church that spoke very highly of itself, rejected critique and basic questions and scoffed at other local churches and prophetic voices in other Christian traditions. There were individual exceptions to this, but not enough to check this elitism. And I was still infected even though we walked away. Looking back, it\u2019s one of the main reasons my initial response after leaving was having no desire to find another church. If this really was the best the Church had to offer, as I was told, why would I want to be a part of it? And if the unhealthy cultural practices I experienced were the only way, as I was told too many times to count, how was I supposed to find a healthy version of it?\nThankfully, the Gospel really is good news in ways we don\u2019t always consider. Jesus and the apostles never gave us a single way to do church. They knew well that the local church would look different as it went into various cultural contexts. What they did provide is a lot of good guidance \u2014 most of Ephesians, as just one example \u2014 strong calls for diversity in community (Acts 8:5\u20138) and warnings about what not to do (Mark 10:41\u201345), none of which justify creating a legalistic religious system. In fact, much of Jesus\u2019 ministry was rejecting the legalism of his day (Luke 11:37\u201354). Two thousand years later, we humans remain enculturated creatures with the gift of a wide space to craft the church in ways that meet the needs of our local contexts and challenge the systems of oppression and legalism around and within us.\nFor better or worse, the local church will always be enculturated and constantly impacted by the broader culture around it. We are supposed to be separate and in not separate and removed from the world around us (1 Thessalonians 4:9\u201312). Holding these experiences in tension and navigating their nuances is not always easy, but they\u2019re also not a vice. Removing oneself from the world is a vice, as it creates a church culture in which people aren\u2019t capable of talking openly about how their beliefs impair their ability to love God and their neighbors.\nFully arriving at these Gospel truths in the context of the where do we even begin looking for a church question was refreshing and opened up the many doors of the global church found in the local context to us. We were liberated by Christ and his global church, rooted in history, to seek out a local church that did not fit the often strict cultural standards of white American evangelicalism. Again, the Gospel really is good news.\nPhoto by Erika Giraud on Unsplash\nWhile this first reason was freeing, the second was more restricting when we examined our local context. One of the most segregated places in the United States today is the American Church, a reality driven by the white supremacy that has deep roots reaching back to before the founding of our country. We get a double dose of this here in my home city of Memphis, where Dr. King was assassinated, our city and suburbs are still mostly segregated in some disturbingly creative ways and truly multiethnic churches that love Jesus and their neighbors are the exception, not the rule. And it seems that a lot of people across the country are fine with situations like this.\nWith Jesus, Scripture and our local context in mind, our family learned that we needed to search for a local church engaged in three ways:\nUnity in diversity, not sameness\nEthnic, theological, political, socio-economic, cultural diversity\u2026we wanted all of it (Ephesians 2:11\u201322), even if it sometimes made us uncomfortable and exposed our own cultural blinders (Ephesians 4).\nInstead of having lengthy statements and silly position papers on various cultural practices that create a congregation of sameness, having broader views built on central creeds of the historic Christian faith \u2014 like the Nicene Creed, as just one example \u2014 can help people more easily find unity despite differences in other areas. Just as important, the actual culture of the church needs to be striving to live up to these beliefs in noticeable ways because they are constantly being revisited (Galatians 6:7\u201310).\nImperfection over systemic unhealth\nNo church is perfect, but there\u2019s a big difference between having flaws and striving to do better compared to enforced systemic unhealth.\nImperfection is a result of the human condition. Churches will make mistakes, leaders will come up short and congregants won\u2019t always see eye to eye because churches are communities of people. People are imperfect, therefor institutions will be imperfect. It\u2019s what grace is for (Ephesians 4:1\u20137).\nEnforced systemic unhealth is something else entirely. It\u2019s when pastors, elders and/or other elite congregation members are actively crafting or maintaining an inward-looking culture rooted in sameness and masquerading it as \u201cGospel truth\u201d (Ephesians 4:14,25\u201332). In his helpful essay for The Atlantic, social psychologist Jonathan Haidt writes \u201cThe most reliable cure for confirmation bias is interaction with people who don\u2019t share your beliefs\u2026But when an institution punishes internal dissent, it shoots darts into its own brain.\u201d While there are many manifestations of enforced systemic unhealth in churches today, some of the most recognizable results are people leaving while citing abuse and unwelcoming environments, aging and radicalizing congregations and inward-looking faith communities that attack and push out those who have legitimate concerns. Enforced systemic unhealth scoffs at grace and sees those it harms as weak or less than them.\nTo be clear, imperfection in a church can still be difficult to deal with and can cause real problems. But enforced systemic unhealth doesn\u2019t allow for self-created problems to be solved in redemptive ways.\nEngaged community over consumer culture\nFinally, we needed a church that extended the Christian faith well beyond Sunday. I\u2019m not talking about a lot of events or studies you can attend during the week. Those things can be useful, but if that\u2019s mostly what is pushed and pursued by a congregation then it\u2019s a telltale sign of a consumer culture, with such events being tightly controlled and the emphasis focused on enforcing a culture of sameness instead of nurturing oneness in diversity. Such a culture merely makes a church busy, not productive, thriving and healthy.\nTrue discipleship, on the other hand, leads to an outward looking church that joyful engages the world in quiet, but tangible ways (1 Thessalonians 4:9\u201310). Congregants feel empowered to act on their own within and outside the church\u2019s walls and do so (Galatians 6:1\u201310). The result is that if such a church ever closed its doors, the broader community would feel the pain of the closure and mourn. This isn\u2019t a revolutionary concept. The early church was considered radical and countercultural not because they spurned the Roman Empire via culture wars and pursuit of political power, but because they served the oppressed and downtrodden in their communities. They didn\u2019t live to be countercultural, they lived for the Gospel in ways that brought goodness to all, with a side effect being that they became countercultural.\nPhoto by Nina Strehl on Unsplash\nClosing Thoughts\nAs I mentioned near the beginning, none of this should be considered prescriptive. This is merely a description of what our journey has looked like in our specific context. Some people don\u2019t have the option of looking for a new local church. Over the past several months, I\u2019ve received more than a few messages from smaller town readers scattered across the American South mentioning that churches in their area are in a race to the bottom.\nI honestly don\u2019t have an answer for such a situation besides reexamining what church even is. At its most basic form \u2014 with all the trappings of American culture stripped away \u2014 church is a translation of the Greek word ekklesia, which takes on a few different meanings such as called-out ones or an assembly. It\u2019s not about a building. It\u2019s about believers coming together. Maybe a few believers meeting once or twice a week in a living room, backyard or local bar and just figuring things out meets the definition of church (Matthew 18:20). It did for me for a season. It\u2019s how some house churches begin.\nRegardless, as I\u2019ve reflected on these things while writing the past few weeks, I have come to understand that there are deeper issues behind what some have said the central question of this journey is: how do you trust a local church, again?\nDeep down, I think many of us understand that this journey is just as much about learning how to deal with betrayal, moving forward when closure is denied and learning \u2014 maybe for the first time \u2014 what trust in community even is.\nMany of us came out of church subcultures in which we were jackhammered into believing that we couldn\u2019t trust ourselves. We were indoctrinated into a lie that we must give blind trust and endless grace to bad leaders and abusers at all costs while leaving none for ourselves and others. This is one of the core reasons we stayed in unhealthy places far longer than we should have. We don\u2019t know how to trust within a communal context because, through bad teaching and direct experience, we all were taught to believe that no one could be trusted.\nThis betrayal extends well beyond ourselves. It wasn\u2019t just that our blind trust and grace given were weaponized back against us, it\u2019s that the Gospel itself was betrayed in the process. The most basic teachings of Jesus were broken. Our ability to think for ourselves was taken. And some of us are grappling with the reality that we perpetuated the betrayal and covered up the underlying issues. We betrayed ourselves just like we were taught to do, and we were committed to the bitter end.\nWe will not be able to trust a local church again until we learn to trust ourselves. Not the kind of pompous, blind trust that bad leaders and abusers demanded of us, but the kind of trust that is real. A trust that allows us to see what is right in front of us for what it is and make sound judgements. A trust that recognizes our imperfections and shortcomings while valuing our worth (Psalm 139:13\u201315). A kind of trust that doesn\u2019t set ourselves up for abuse. A trust that comes with grace for our former selves and for those on similar journeys.\nTrust in all good forms requires courage. It demands risk. But it also asks for time. Time to process and time to grieve. Time for healing. Time for saying out loud the truth about our experiences and naming them as wrong. Time that some people don\u2019t want you to have, but time that Jesus offers to you freely (Matthew 11:28\u201330). Learning to trust ourselves in this way \u2014 in Christ \u2014 informs us when we are ready to start moving forward again.\nWhen we take this time, we begin to see the betrayal as so much more than just pain and grief. The betrayal itself is redeemed as a gift, a spark of hope that begins a journey to true freedom in Christ (1 Peter 4:12\u201313). Somewhere on that road we can begin looking for a new local church, an imperfect one that seeks trust in good faith. We can become who we are supposed to be: people being sanctified in the love of Christ within the context of community.\nDeep down, we\u2019re all searching for a lot more than a new Sunday. It\u2019s okay to say so out loud.\nI explore faith, culture, and empathy from Memphis, TN. Never miss an article by signing up for my free email newsletter.

Maybe that\u2019s okay.\nDesigned with Canva\nIt\u2019s always been this way is a statement I have heard too many times to count.\nThe certainty behind those words in white American evangelical spaces has proven to be problematic. When we look to church history, we learn that things have not always been this way. Other times, we only have to think back a few years within our own contexts to see change, or fear preventing change.\nI can\u2019t think of an issue I\u2019ve been told it\u2019s always been this way about more than gender roles in the church. Until recently, I\u2019ve been in conservative white evangelical spaces for most of my life. I know as well as anyone how complementarian culture can cast a long, dark shadow over churches.\nIt\u2019s always been this way\u2026\nIt\u2019s easy to nod along with strict gender roles if you\u2019ve been isolated to an inward-looking subculture. When one has nothing to compare their subcultural experiences and beliefs to, it\u2019s easy to inappropriately universalize both. But how did we get where we are now?\nDoes the Bible really say women are never allowed to teach men? Should women only be homemakers or be strongly encouraged in that direction? Will society collapse if we don\u2019t adhere to rigid \u2014 sometimes even cartoonish \u2014 gender roles, as is often implied in white evangelical spaces?\nThe Making of Biblical Womanhood excavates some of the roots of western Christianity and provides insightful answers. It shows us the why behind the modern white evangelical deference to domineering male leaders within a subculture that often disregards female perspectives and gifts. Story and history entwine beautifully in this book. Rather than provide a summary \u2014 seriously, just go buy it \u2014 I want to explore a few themes in the book and some of the conversation around it.\nThe Bible, untold stories, and history pose a serious challenge to the complementarian narrative\nSo many memories ebbed and flowed in my mind as I read The Making of Biblical Womanhood by Dr. Beth Allison Barr, Professor of History at Baylor University. After describing leaving a beloved church because her husband was fired for questioning the institution\u2019s decision to not allow women in certain aspects of ministry, Barr writes:\n\u201cAnd the hardest truth of it all was that I bore greater responsibility than most in our church because I had known that complementarian theology was wrong\u2026I knew that it was based on a handful of verses read apart from their historical context and used as a lens to interpret the rest of the Bible\u2026 Cultural assumptions and practices regarding womanhood are read into the biblical text, rather than the biblical text being read within its own historical and cultural context.\u201d(6)\nSuch experiences in white evangelicalism are as stunning as they are familiar. What I found largely unfamiliar was the next 200+ pages, in which Barr shares a more robust history of women in church history \u2014 many from the medieval era, as Barr is a medieval historian\u2014 who taught and sacrificed so well for God, the church, and their neighbors.\nWhile I was encouraged to see familiar stories like Mary, Martha, Phoebe, and Junia presented well in their cultural context, I must admit that I\u2019d never heard the stories of women like Hilda of Whitby and Margery Kempe. Barr shows how, time and again, men have downplayed the role of women in church history, or changed the narrative of their stories so much that we miss their true character altogether.\nThis concept of biblical womanhood exists today as part of a set of gendered cultural practices that white evangelical leaders call complementarianism. If you\u2019re not familiar with the term, it\u2019s basically a modern evangelical rebranding of patriarchy. The word is not found in the Bible. It came into being in the 1970/80s as a very American experience, although it has been exported to some other parts of the world with mixed results.\nWhite evangelical leaders claim that complementarianism is the biblical view that men and women have different roles in marriage, the church, and on questions of social authority. They say that men and women have equal value in God\u2019s eyes, but that does not mean they have the same responsibilities or can perform the same duties. Many white evangelicals treat this gendered lifestyle as a static concept stemming from the insularity of their own subculture, but even more theologically well-traveled complementarians view the living out of these beliefs as existing on a spectrum. It looks different in different places. Some common beliefs though are:\nOnly men can hold church leadership positions. Women may be allowed to lead, but cannot be given authority and teaching opportunities over men.\nMen lead in the household, with the wife playing various supportive roles.\nWomen must submit to their husband\u2019s leadership and needs, be it socially, culturally, or sexually.\nThe Making of Biblical Womanhood is an untelling of the complementarian narrative, using both history and Scripture to accomplish the task. Barr shows how a series of definable historical events paved the way for what is known as biblical womanhood today. Going to Scripture, she examines the first female deacons and apostles, who all subverted the gender roles of the empire around them to serve the early Church well.\nWhat I found most intriguing though was Barr\u2019s examination of the Apostle Paul. This is where most white evangelical leaders go to argue for complementarianism (see 1 Timothy 2, as just one example). It\u2019s easy to read Paul as having some retrograde views on women if you take the \u201cplain-reading\u201d approach to the Bible as many evangelicals do. Barr mentions how some of her students who read the Bible this way tell her \u201cI hate Paul\u201d due to how uncharitable he appears to women. (39)\nBut Barr shows that Paul was especially revolutionary when his writings are viewed in his context of the patriarchal Roman Empire. Her response to some of her students has been \u201cit isn\u2019t Paul they hate; rather, they hate how Paul\u2019s letters have become foundational to an understanding of biblical gender roles that oppress women.\u201d (41) She asks:\n\u201cCould we have gotten Paul exactly backward? What if his focus was never male headship and female submission? What if his vision was bigger than we ever imagined? What if instead of replicating an ancient gender hierarchy, Paul was showing us how the Christian gospel sets even the Roman household free?\u201d (55)\nLater, Barr shows how the failure to ask such important questions has led to undesirable results over the centuries:\nThe emphasis on Pauline texts by early modern reformers was born into a secular world already supported by a gender hierarchy. Rather than Protestant reformers reviving a biblical model, they were simply mapping Scripture onto a preceding secular structure. Instead of Scripture transforming society, Paul\u2019s writings were used to prop up the patriarchal practices already developing in the early modern world. (123)\nWe see the same thing today in much of white American evangelicalism. Scripture has been mapped onto American culture since before the country was founded. The Bible has been used to justify slavery, the murder and forced displacement of indigenous peoples, segregation, and \u2014 yes \u2014 harsh gender roles that have given way to abuse in our institutions and culture. And many of those who preceded and founded modern white American evangelicalism played negative roles in those darker chapters of our history.\nWhy is it this way? The Making of Biblical Womanhood provides a robust multi-faceted answer, but two thoughts came to mind as I turned the pages.\nFirst, many white American evangelicals hold to a heavily-biased version of history that glorifies the good, downplays the bad, and, in some cases, rewrites history altogether. Put another way, evangelicals have crafted their own history, one that portrays them as the heroes of Christianity and the United States, and retold it back to themselves for decades. Enough time has passed that, for a lot of people, this is the only version of history they know.\nThis reality has made some evangelical gatekeepers incapable of listening to other perspectives and stories that challenge their beliefs, because much of their work is done in an intellectually ghettoized and self-legitimizing culture. The logical implications of this can be incredibly destructive (i.e. widespread evangelical support for Trump). When something or someone doesn\u2019t fit neatly into their cultural and theological grid, they are treated as a threat to be destroyed. We\u2019ll examine that more in a minute.\nThe absence of a more robust historical view and a lack of understanding how the past shapes us today is not an empty void. More often than not, ideology has taken its place. Statements like it\u2019s always been this way are a tell-tale sign that the nuances of history are unknown or unappreciated.\nNot the ESV. Image by stempow from Pixabay\nSecond, I think many of us have underestimated the consumer culture surrounding the English Standard Version (ESV) translation of the Bible, which is very heavy-handed on gender politics. I can\u2019t think of a single time I\u2019ve heard a complementarian argument come from any other translation.\nThere\u2019s a lot of evidence suggesting that entrenching complementarian teaching was a major goal of at least some of the translation committee. To borrow a phrase from biblical scholar Mark Strauss, some evangelicals treat the ESV as the \u201cStandard English Version\u201d (i.e. it\u2019s the only reliable translation). On page 23 of his critique of the ESV, he writes on gender:\n\u201cOne wonders why, if the ESV footnote acknowledges that \u2018adelphoi\u2019 here means \u2018brothers and sisters,\u2019 it was not translated as such. The most likely answer is that the translators were concerned about their constituents, who would have objected to this perceived condescension to a feminist agenda. All translation is to some extent political, and in this case perhaps it was deemed necessary to sacrifice accuracy for expediency.\u201d\nYikes.\nAltogether, Barr\u2019s examination of Scripture within the cultural contexts of the time passages were written, untold female stories, and history pose a serious challenge to the complementarian narrative. That\u2019s useful on its own, but it also raises another important question that can\u2019t be avoided.\nTheological commitments, ignorance, or idolatry?\nOne of the primary sets of questions I found myself wrestling with while reading The Making of Biblical Womanhood had to do with motivations.\nDo men and women who believe in this narrow type of womanhood believe because of their reading of Scripture, or because they were told this is the only way to live? Do those who reject the evidence that gender roles in Christianity can be culturally-rooted do so because of evidence they perceive saying otherwise, or because they\u2019ve confused a certain lifestyle with the Gospel? And why do some complementarians act as if tweaking rigid gender roles will lead to the end of Christianity and the downfall of the United States?\nLike history, the answers are complicated.\nI know more than a few kind-hearted complementarians who take Scripture seriously and respect people who disagree with them on this issue. I\u2019ve even seen some stand up to abusers and be verbally pummeled for doing so. For those of us who have been chewed up and spit out of a white evangelical institution, we know that\u2019s not nothing.\nMost people I\u2019ve met over the years though live under complementarianism without having even heard the term or knowing the history of where it comes from. This stems from leaders telling them it\u2019s always been this way and blind loyalty to their institutions. People don\u2019t know what they don\u2019t know. There should be grace for that up to a point; however, we must also understand that honest ignorance can be dangerous. More on that later.\nDisturbingly, I\u2019ve met quite a few white evangelicals who openly commit idolatry to complementarian culture. Their faith \u2014 if such a thing can be called faith \u2014 is built on hyper-narrow views of a gendered, white ethnocentric lifestyle, not the redeeming love of Christ. The subtitle of Barr\u2019s book is How The Subjugation of Women Became Gospel Truth. This isn\u2019t a punchy marketing ploy to sell more books. For some white evangelicals, subjugating women is Gospel truth. Let me provide just one example.\nPurity culture was all the rage as I was coming of age in the 2000s. Girls were told to dress modestly to protect their sexual purity and, more importantly, the purity of the boys around them. Boys were often taught that their biggest battle was controlling their sexual impulses. As I mentioned in my review of Jesus and John Wayne \u2014 another fantastic book you should read \u2014 talking about sex and purity all the time only made teenagers think about sex all the time. My generation was told that if we saved ourselves for marriage, sex would be fireworks (spoilers: for a lot of people, it wasn\u2019t).\nPerhaps inevitably, purity culture was bound to make an appearance in The Making of Biblical Womanhood. Barr shares a story of one of her brushes with purity culture while working with a youth group. After describing a camp employee trying to enforce a confusing dress code during a \u201csticky hot\u201d summer \u2014 come visit the American South in July if you want to experience that\u2014 she shares what happened next:\n\u201cShe wasn\u2019t happy with me, but she let us continue. That conversation was the beginning of a weeklong modesty battle with camp leaders. After the worship service, one of the camp directors paid me a special visit to tell me that the girls needed to comply with the recently changed dress code. Tank tops were not allowed. I challenged him. Sleeveless was allowed. Our youth had only brought so many things to wear. I was unmoved.\nApparently the camp leaders were unmoved too. They showed up at my door that night with a box of extra-large T-shirts for the girls to wear. I think my mouth fell open. I was really upset. I returned the box.\nThe next morning, the girls and I were called into a special meeting. One of the young men working at the camp came to talk with us. It is really important, he told us, that beautiful young women be careful in how they dress. Boys have difficulty controlling their imaginations, and when they see a bra strap, well, it can cause them to sin. Modesty honors God, and didn\u2019t the girls want to honor God?\nOnce again, we were given a box of shirts. This time the message was clear \u2014 cover up, or we will ask you to leave. We never went back to that camp.\u201d (154\u2013155)\nSo much cringe.\nMy experience with purity culture was more nuanced than others in my generation. Looking back, there were people around me who bought into it. There were also good men and women who lived the complementarian lifestyle, but strongly emphasized good character development in ways that undermined purity culture. Someone once gave me the book I Kissed Dating Goodbye and a leader cautioned me that it was \u201cproblematic.\u201d I don\u2019t remember purity rings at my childhood church. I did see them elsewhere, displayed more as a marker of tribal loyalty than adherence to any sexual ethic. Being a teenager is already confusing. Purity culture made it worse.\nWhat purity culture felt like for a lot of 2000s teens. Photo by Stormseeker on Unsplash.\nPurity culture made boys feel like we would never be able to control ourselves. It sexualized girl\u2019s bodies against their will. It made many feel ashamed for no good reason. I saw some of the harm of purity culture despite avoiding the worst of it. It\u2019s not hard to imagine how destructive it was at churches where impossible standards were enforced with brutal abandon.\nI write this to show how one aspect of the bad fruits of complementarianism decimated my generation in so many ways. It remains a primary driver of the deconstruction phenomenon and casts a long shadow over our marriages. Sadly, for many white evangelicals, that doesn\u2019t matter. Adhering to rigid gender roles and expectations is far more important than the damaged people in the rear-view mirror. Questioning what white patriarchal authority says is treated as questioning God himself. And that\u2019s exactly how this subculture morphs from being a lifestyle choice into open idolatry.\nNot every white American evangelical commits idolatry to complementarian culture, but enough certainly do to cause severe problems. Others are so resistant to discussing minor changes that it is easy to confuse their cultural commitments with idolatry. In my experience, this stems from a mix of monolithic interpretations of identity in Scripture, failure to confront fear in the face of abuse, not being taught how to deal with conflict, and discomfort with living in the tension of completely trusting a God who is so mysterious that He cannot be fully understood. The urge for certainty and clinging to false notions of it pulls us away from Christ.\nWhich brings me to the final point I want to explore.\nPosture, character formation, and the fruits of the spirit can never be undervalued\nI want to shift gears and examine how The Making of Biblical Womanhood is being received. If you go online, you\u2019ll find that people have very strong emotions about the book. Disturbingly, some manifestations of those emotions are far from Christlike.\nKevin DeYoung, a pastor and writer at The Gospel Coalition, opened his critique of the book by casting doubt on some of Barr\u2019s real-life experiences, a move that is both not befitting of a pastor and common in this subculture. His words are aggressively ungenerous and odd, something Barr points out in her response. At some point though, DeYoung seems to have just moved on.\nOthers haven\u2019t.\nThe Council on Biblical Manhood and Womanhood (CBMW) has shown an especially strong distaste for healthy posture, good character formation, and the fruits of the spirit in their never-ending personal attacks on Barr. If you\u2019ve never heard of CBMW, here\u2019s how they explain themselves:\n\u201cIn 1987, CBMW was established primarily to help the church defend against the accommodation of secular feminism. At this time many evangelicals were beginning to experiment with an ideology that would later become known as evangelical feminism. This was a significant departure from what the church had practiced from its beginning regarding the role of men and women in the home and local church. The effects of this departure have not been benign. As evangelical feminism continues to spread, the evangelical community needs to be aware that this debate reaches ultimately to the heart of the gospel.\u201d\nThose are\u2026bold claims. Regardless of how that makes you feel, CBMW is taken very seriously in many white American evangelical circles, which is why I\u2019m going to take them seriously here.\nThe response to The Making of Biblical Womanhood from CBMW can only be described as sinful. CBMW President Denny Burk seems to closely monitor Barr\u2019s tweets and is constantly trying to cram her into box so he can more easily attack her \u2014 often misusing the Chicago Statement with creedal weight to do so\u2014 even though the authors were clear in the preface it should not be used as such. Disgustingly, CBMW Director Colin Smothers attacked Barr\u2019s church community as a fundraising tool, which backfired as Christians across the country sent a flood of donations to her church instead.\nThese are just two of many examples. When white American evangelicalism\u2019s flagship organizations and some of the subculture\u2019s top leaders behave so poorly, we should not be surprised when some in the rank and file do the same. Evidence suggests that CBMW is little more than a fundamentalist gatekeeping outfit pushing a culture of brutal gender idolatry onto churches and cyberstalking those who disagree with them. And, remember, this is the organization many pastors and elders look to for guidance.\nWatching some of this play out has reminded me how little value is placed on healthy posture, good character formation, and the fruits of the spirit in certain parts of white American evangelicalism. Even if these men were right in their views, they make it exceedingly difficult for others who might take them seriously to do so because their posture is dismissive and domineering and they are obsessed with gender roles (power structure) over good character formation and pursuit of truth (signs of sanctification at work). Time and again, we\u2019ve seen them aim a flamethrower at the fruits of the spirit, emptying the tank as they conflate a narrow, culturally-rooted, and unmoored-from-history interpretation of scripture with biblical inerrancy.\nInevitably, they end up exhibiting the very behavior that Barr calls out in The Making of Biblical Womanhood. Power usurps some of the most practical aspects of what it means to be a Christian. Lower order doctrines and beliefs are treated as first order ones, and first order ones abandoned. Institutions are protected at the expense of victims. Leaders aren\u2019t held accountable and victims are railroaded. In the end, the pursuit of a very narrow-minded Christendom usurps Christ himself. Don\u2019t believe this is happening? Kevin DeYoung gave away the game in this shocking 2020 Gospel Coalition piece.\nI love that this stock photo exists. Photo by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\nQuestions of gender roles in the Church are not a first order doctrine, but many evangelicals don\u2019t know that because some of their leaders act as if complementarian culture is their god. It is shocking, but not surprising. This is a continuation of an aggressive American masculinity and subdued feminity bleeding over into certain parts of the church and being repackaged as \u201cGospel-truth.\u201d In white American evangelicalism, the 1950s-era is looked back on with rose-colored glasses. Interestingly, that\u2019s when government investment disproportionately benefited white evangelicals, the country was still racially segregated by law, and \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 gender hierarchy was deeply entrenched everywhere. It\u2019s not difficult to understand why such a lifestyle became Gospel-truth. Once you have eyes to see it, you can\u2019t unsee it.\nOf course, not all evangelicals behave this way. I learned about the necessity of having a healthy posture, good character formation, and the fruits of the spirit in the evangelical church I grew up in. I will always be grateful for that.\nBut the older I\u2019ve gotten, the more I\u2019ve learned that some of my earlier experiences are not representative of what many others have been through. CBMW\u2019s teachings are everywhere in this subculture. It\u2019d be delusional not to understand how their toxic masculinity, lack of good character formation, and abandonment of the fruits of the spirit trickled into faith communities alongside their abusive teachings.\nClosing Thoughts\nAfter reading the final pages of The Making of Biblical Womanhood, a wave of contradictory emotions washed over me. I felt inspired, hopeful, grateful, and pessimistic all at the same time.\nInspired by the female voices I\u2019d never heard before. Hopeful that things can change because they have been different in the past. Grateful for Beth Allison Bar and her work to help people better understand the why behind the what. Pessimistic because I\u2019m intimately aware of the dominant church culture surrounding me here in Tennessee, arguably the geographic headquarters of white American evangelicalism in more ways than one.\nIn many churches here, issues far less consequential than gender are fought against tooth and nail. I\u2019ll never forget the time a frustrated local pastor told me that changing the light bulbs in his church was viewed as a slippery slope. I chuckled. The story he then told showed he wasn\u2019t kidding.\nThe past few years, I\u2019ve come to believe that this subculture will never change. I\u2019ve often wondered how we can move forward when this is the dominant church culture in your geographic area, even if you aren\u2019t directly in it.\nArguing with a lot of white evangelicals from a different interpretation or translation of Scripture doesn\u2019t seem to help. Providing stories of the pain, abuse, or broken marriages stemming from complementarianism doesn\u2019t either. Again, I\u2019ve heard phrases like it\u2019s always been this way and but the Bible says too many times to count. I take such conflations of one\u2019s reading of Scripture with the concept of biblical inerrancy seriously because those people wanted me to take them seriously.\nBut I\u2019ve since come to understand that this framing isn\u2019t helpful. The self-annihilating white evangelical culture war against everyone who has even mild disagreements with them is as two-dimensional as it is destructive. It is somehow both boring and infuriating at the same time. I\u2019d rather lean into the messiness of history. I\u2019d rather be in diverse relationships that provide a richer view of the world and what God is doing in it. I want discipleship to change and sanctify me because that\u2019s what discipleship is supposed to do. I want men and women to experience the fullness of God in community.\nPerhaps closing with a story can hint at a potential path forward. I recently had a conversation with a friend who believes in gender roles. He read The Making of Biblical Womanhood a few months before me. I asked if Barr\u2019s work changed anything for him. After some thought, he said:\n\u201cI still think gender roles are biblical. My big takeaway though is that we can do the right thing the wrong way for the wrong reasons, to the point that it\u2019s not right anymore. All the hurt marriages, support of Trump, and people leaving churches tells me we\u2019re doing this wrong. So many women in this book lived so much better than we are. Why wouldn\u2019t we want to be more like them?\nI don\u2019t think I can call myself a Christian if I can\u2019t listen to people who have been hurt by my beliefs. I don\u2019t want to abandon what I believe, but I want better results. I think that\u2019s possible, but I also understand why a lot of people don\u2019t.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a lot there, and I\u2019m not suggesting that softer complementarianism is the answer. Barr closes her book with a benediction for women who have reached their breaking point: go, be free! (218). If this gendered cultural system is crushing you and your faith, leave. Run if you must.\nWhat is in his words that I find hopeful though is a real desire to do better. I hear a recognition that there are dangerous problems baked into complementarianism. I hear a respect for egalitarians and a broken heart for the abused. This subculture may never change, but people can.\nI\u2019m convinced this stock photo was made for this piece. Photo by Nick Fewings on Unsplash.\nLike my friend, we should all be focusing less on building up fortresses that turn into subcultural concentration camps and more on listening across the chasm of our differences and lived experiences. This does not mean the answer is an unresponsive centrism. The answer is having churches that love God and our neighbors well within a culture of goodness. There are many ways to do that, because every expression of the Gospel in community is enculturated. After all, we\u2019re all human.\nThis also means there is common ground. If there is one thing we can all agree on, it\u2019s that the brutal gender idolatry pushed by CBMW and others does not belong in the church. It is neither just nor biblical. If a faith community chooses to live by defined gender roles with strong systems of accountability and ample ways for men and women to serve because it matches the personality of the church, then that is what it is.\nBut it\u2019s another thing entirely to openly oppress people, including complementarians who sincerely want to live for Jesus and who demand accountability. The CBMW is one of the main roots of an oppressive cultural system that those who believe in gender roles and those who do not can work together to uproot and overthrow. And, to be blunt, if you wish to remain in a church culture built on gender roles, you should find a better apologetic for your beliefs, because the CBMW has proven to be one of the worst.\nI think this is what makes The Making of Biblical Womanhood so incredibly freeing. One reason Barr\u2019s research is helpful is that the history she provides is story-centric. Everyone can relate to these stories. They are colorful and take us outside our boxes. They tell us something about different times, places, and people. And they tell us something about ourselves.\nBarr has pried open a space for real people to have real conversations about an issue that touches us all. She has blazed a path around the absurd intransigence of gatekeepers by showing that this narrow view of biblical womanhood is deeply influenced by historical moments and modern culture, and thus often departs from Christianity.\nSystemic change that brings glory to God and expands human flourishing is rarely achieved overnight. But I\u2019ve seen the once impossible becoming possible. The freedom found in Christ stands in stark contrast to the shackles that John Piper, Wayne Grudem, and many other white evangelical leaders have forced onto people for decades. We can all rejoice that Barr reminds us our call is to follow Jesus, who breaks such chains as we move closer to him.\nThe Making of Biblical Womanhood is as much a story of Barr\u2019s love for truth and her brothers and sisters in Christ as it is a work of history. The revolutionary love of Jesus can be felt in the turning of every page, which is why I encourage others to take her work and voice to heart.\nI explore faith, culture, and empathy from Memphis, TN.

It now feels like we are confronted by such disruptions almost weekly amidst the social upheaval, change, and unveiling of truth around us.\nAnother shocking story slammed into American Christianity this week, or re-slammed, depending on your view of things. The Vanity Fair deep dive into the rise and fall of Jerry Falwell Jr., disgraced former president of the country\u2019s largest Christian university, has generated a lot of interest and debate online. You can read the piece below:\nInside Jerry Falwell Jr.'s Unlikely Rise and Precipitous Fall at Liberty University\nJerry Falwell Jr. was the Trump-anointing dark prince of the Christian right. Then a sex scandal rocked his marriage\u2026www.vanityfair.com\nFalwell\u2019s personal shortcomings aren\u2019t what I want to explore here. Sadly, stories like these are common in white American evangelicalism. Keep in mind that Falwell represents just one of a number of scandals that make up the moral collapse at Liberty University, the same types of scandals ripping through evangelical institutions and churches across the country.\nI want to examine the debate itself, because many people don\u2019t seem to realize that it\u2019s a debate already being settled by ordinary people offline.\nEvery time a story like this emerges, the on-again off-again debate around whether moral failings and abuse are features or bugs in the white American evangelical belief system is flipped on like a light switch. The general public can see some of this play out online at the elite levels of American evangelicalism (y\u2019all, elite American evangelical Twitter is wild).\nBut many of these stories are also talked about in hushed tones at the local church level on Sunday mornings, in small groups, and in prayer meetings. In many white evangelical churches specifically, these moral failings and stories of abuse are brushed off with claims that such people are not real Christians or not actually evangelical or that the culture got\u2019em. Dripping with condescension, such statements come from the deep-rooted belief in many white American evangelical spaces that they mostly have all the answers and just need to double down to protect themselves and become immune from the slightest of criticisms.\nWhether or not you think that stories like Jerry Falwell Jr.\u2019s are a feature or a bug of white American evangelical institutions and churches, there\u2019s a hair-raising quote from Falwell at the end of the piece that deserves attention:\n\u201cNothing in history has done more to turn people away from Christianity than organized religion. The religious elite has got this idea that somehow their sins aren\u2019t as bad as everyone else\u2019s.\u201d\nWhat makes these words astounding is that this comes from a man who, until very recently, was sitting at the apex of the white American evangelical elite class. Falwell clearly meant this as a jab at evangelicals writ large, even citing Franklin Graham as a specific example. To be blunt, Falwell is perfectly comfortable indicting himself as he points to white American evangelicalism and says that most of its elite leaders are full of crap.\nNow, we should not root a broader criticism of white American evangelicalism in Falwell\u2019s thoughts of the subculture. I don\u2019t believe Falwell\u2019s assessment is accurate merely because of who he is or what he says. I also know more than a few kind-hearted evangelicals. Some of them are even more critical of white American evangelicalism than I am. Regardless, I believe such moral failings and abuse are features of this subculture for two reasons separate from Falwell.\nThe first is the seemingly endless stories of moral collapse and abuse pouring out of white American evangelical institutions and churches. Many evangelicals at all levels demand at all costs the restoration of leaders who have fallen, including up to the point of railroading victims, silencing advocates, and covering up abuse. Time and time again, we\u2019ve seen white evangelical leaders aim a flamethrower at the fruits of the spirit, emptying the tank as they conflate a narrow, culturally-rooted, and unmoored-from-history interpretation of scripture with biblical inerrancy.\nSecond, many good people who have left or are leaving white American evangelical churches, be they in a denomination or not, already believe that moral collapse and abuse are features of this cultural system. For them, the argument ended a while ago. It\u2019s critically important to not only listen, but also to see who they are. The best, brightest, and most engaged are the ones walking away. Russell Moore, a well-known American evangelical, wrote this last year:\n\u201cMany of us have observed, anecdotally, a hemorrhaging of younger evangelicals from churches and institutions in recent years. What seems different about this quiet exodus is that the departures are heightened not among the peripheries of the church \u2014 those \u2018nominal\u2019 or \u2018cultural\u2019 Christians who grow up to rebel against their parents\u2019 beliefs \u2014 but instead among those who are the most committed to what were previously thought to be the hardest aspects of Christian religion in modernity: belief in \u2018the supernatural,\u2019 the rigorous demands of discipleship, and a longing for community and accountability in a multigenerational church with ancient roots and transcendent authority.\nWe now see young evangelicals walking away from evangelicalism not because they do not believe what the church teaches, but because they believe the church itself does not believe what the church teaches\u2026The problem now is not that people think the church\u2019s way of life is too demanding, too morally rigorous, but that they have come to think the church doesn\u2019t believe its own moral teachings.\u201d\nFor many former evangelicals, including people who are still conservative and Christian, the Falwell story only adds to the factual evidence at the heart of Moore\u2019s assessment. Good people were being given undeniable reasons to believe that moral collapse and abuse are features of white American evangelicalism long before Falwell\u2019s fall.\nWhen a large corner of the American Church is this inward-looking and focused on protecting their own cultural power, the logical result is systemic failure: unethical leadership, fractured faith communities, and destroyed lives. The question then is not why would someone leave? It is why would someone stay when liberty in Christ can be found so easily in other Christian traditions and faith communities elsewhere?\nI explore faith and culture from Memphis, Tennessee.

Holland Fellow in Cyber Policy and Security at the Hoover Institution, both at Stanford University.\nData collected by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) and the Census Bureau revealed that over 40% of the U.S. population in the 3rd week of July 2020 exhibited symptoms of anxiety or depression disorder, which are clinical diagnoses.[1] The comparable figure from the same survey given in the January-June 2019 time frame was 26%. Symptoms of anxiety or depression disorder included frequently having little interest or pleasure in doing things; feeling down, depressed, or hopeless; feeling nervous, anxious, or on edge; and not being able to stop or control worrying.\nA second poll conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) and released on April 24, 2020 found that over half of U.S. adults (56%) report that worry or stress related to the coronavirus outbreak has caused them to experience at least one negative effect on their mental health and wellbeing, such as problems with sleeping or eating, increased alcohol use, or worsening chronic conditions.[2] 40% report that worry or stress has led to problems with their sleep, while 15% had difficulty controlling their temper and 13% reported increases in their alcohol or drug use. (The reason that the KFF figure is higher than the Census Bureau figure is likely that the KFF was not probing for clinical diagnoses, which is a more severe condition than that measured by the KFF poll.)\nIt is useful to look at some of these mental health issues with finer granularity.\nDepression. Individuals suffering from depression often lose their self-confidence and feel overly vulnerable or incapable. Sometimes, they exhibit emotional dullness or numbness. That is, emotions such as pride, shame, hope, grief, and gratitude are sharply attenuated, even when circumstances or events occur that would normally spark such emotions. Social companionship may become less of a priority, as individuals become more withdrawn and silent and they seek to isolate themselves. Individuals may be less talkative than usual and show limited response to jokes or cries. Personal hygiene and grooming also assume less importance, and the individual may present as more disheveled in appearance, with little professional bearing.\nAnxiety. Anxiety is characterized as a disproportionate response to uncertainty about potential threats. People who suffer from anxiety are often fearful, restless, pre-occupied with worst-case scenarios, unable to relax, or physically agitated.\nMental distraction. People who are mentally distracted often suffer from forgetfulness and an inability to concentrate. They may have difficulty sorting out priorities or starting routine tasks. They may be excessively concerned with minor issues and exhibit a tendency to do familiar tasks and a preoccupation with familiar details. Conversely, they may have a hard time performing unfamiliar tasks. They may be restless, wandering aimlessly. Attention spans may be short, making it difficult for them to understand what others are saying. They are often unable to take the initiative in starting any activity, or they may take a long time to react to occurrences that normally require prompt attention.\nIrritability and angry outbursts. Mild irritability may include angry looks, sharp words, tears, or profanity in response to normal, everyday comments or incidents or relatively slight frustrations or provocations (e.g., the closing of a window, an accidental bumping, or just normal verbal interactions). More severe irritability may include sporadic and unpredictable explosions of aggressive or violent behavior.\nSleep disturbances and fatigue. With sleep disturbances in play, falling asleep is difficult even when the objective situation is safe for sleep. The individual may awaken frequently and have difficulty going back to sleep. Sleep may be accompanied by nightmares or other terror dreams, involving, for example, images of oneself or one\u2019s loved ones dying. Sleep of this nature is not restful, and the individual may wake up as tired as when that person went to sleep. Individuals may also sleep excessively \u2014 significantly more than 7\u20139 hours per day. When these individuals are awake, they often exhibit low energy levels when they expend a great deal of effort on only a few or minor tasks.\nHypervigilance. Hypervigilance is characterized by excessive sensitivity (such as a fight-or-flight response) to external stimuli that might signal danger, even if that stimulus is associated with a benign object, event, or person. Hypervigilant individuals often overreact or misinterpret unexpected noise, movement, or light. They may even overreact to reassuring information, perceiving such information as threatening.\nMost interesting about the list of symptoms above is that it is taken from U.S. Army manuals intended to provide leaders of combat units with information about how to identify stress resulting from combat operations. U.S. Army Field Manual FM 6\u201322.5 (March 2009, Combat and Operational Stress Control Manual for Leaders and Soldiers) describes combat stressors as \u201csingular incidents that have the potential to significantly impact the unit or soldiers experiencing them,\u201d whereas operational stressors include \u201cmultiple combat stressors or prolonged exposures due to continued operations in hostile environments (emphasis added).\u201d Sometimes, these stressors are related to multiple potentially traumatic events, which are events that are \u201cperceived and experienced as a threat to one\u2019s safety or to the stability of one\u2019s world.\u201d\nReactions to combat and operational stress are not the same as post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSDs). That said, they may well share some symptomatic similarities, and the distinction between the two are not always clear. One key difference is chronological sequencing \u2014 in PTSD, symptoms of disorder appear after the event(s) occur, though the definition of \u201cafter\u201d may be somewhat fuzzy given the ongoing nature of operational stress.\nA decidedly unscientific survey of friends and acquaintances of mine indicates that these symptoms and manifestations have been surprisingly common since March 2020, when the seriousness of the COVID-19 outbreak began to be understood. A second point whose relevance will be apparent below is that the COVID-19 pandemic is unlike other national traumas in that the social mechanisms of family, friendship, and companionship that often moderate the effects of stress are unavailable to much of the citizenry.\nA personal anecdote is relevant here. Much of the period between March 2020 and the present has been spent under a shelter-in-place order of some kind. Individuals, especially those in high-risk groups (I am a member of one such group), are advised to stay home as much as possible to avoid exposure to others who may be carriers of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19. However, it is also necessary to venture outside for exercise, such as walking.\nI live in an urban neighborhood and when I go outside for a walk, I find I am constantly scanning the streets and sidewalks for other human beings. My immediate reaction to the sighting of any human being is to react to that human as a potential threat. I consciously evaluate the threat by trying to determine if that human being is wearing a mask properly. If my answer is negative, I immediately seek ways to escape \u2014 turning around, crossing the street, or allowing the person to pass but with my back turned and holding my breath for a few seconds after the person has passed.\nI used these words advisedly \u2014 an unmasked person *is* a threat, and an encounter with that individual could kill me if the virus is present in his or her body. Given the incidence of COVID-19 where I live (San Francisco), the likelihood that the person is COVID-positive is low \u2014 almost certainly less than 10 percent. And the likelihood of contracting the virus from a single pass-by with another person outside is also low \u2014 probably less than 1 in ten thousand (more a speculative guess than anything else). But I *feel* threatened with bodily harm by every such person \u2014 and these are the neighbors among whom I live.\nWhere else can this phenomenon be seen? One can certainly imagine this phenomenon happening when soldiers on counter-insurgency missions come across a village in which 200 villagers are probably friendly or neutral (i.e., pose no threat) and one person may be carrying a grenade underneath a shirt. The likelihood that one person in the village would want to do those soldiers bodily harm is low, but it is not zero, and soldiers learn to regard everyone in the village is a potential lethal threat. Usually this does not lead to open uses of force, but the sense of threat under those circumstances cannot be eliminated \u2014 and they have to regard every person in the village as a potential threat until shown otherwise. That is, the default assumption must be that a villager is regarded as potentially threatening until evidence disproves that assumption.\nOf course, the scenario above is no one-time event. As stressful as the scenario is, it is repeated many times over a tour of duty. These then are the multiple potentially traumatic events that the soldier perceives and experiences as a threat to safety \u2014 and what lead to the symptoms of operational stress. And soldiers in combat zones have usually deployed far from home, away from the social support that usually helps people to cope with mental and emotional stress. (So too is the case with public health guidelines calling for social distancing \u2014 hugs from friends and relatives not within my shelter-in-place pod are off-limits.)\nI do not pretend for a moment that what I am experiencing in my walks around town carry in any way the same significance or risk as for the combat soldier. I have never been under actual fire, even though I have been a student of national security affairs for 40+ years. But it appears to me that living through the pandemic has some of the features, in a much less intense way, of that combat experience \u2014 and perhaps it has given me a point of departure for understanding, in a very small way, what ground soldiers on patrol in Iraq or Afghanistan must experience every day.\nWhat does any of this have to do with systemic racism? There is at least one group of citizens that experiences these phenomena on a regular basis all the time, though in a different context. Nearly every Black American family knows to teach its children about how to avoid trouble with the police. For me (not a Black citizen), I was taught that as long as I did things that were not illegal, I would never get into trouble with the police \u2014 and for the most part, that has been my personal experience.\nBut that\u2019s hardly the experience of Black Americans, who have often been stopped for the \u201ccrime\u201d of driving or walking while being Black. From the perspective of many, and perhaps most, Black Americans, every police officer is a potential lethal threat. I stress the word \u201cpotential,\u201d which contrasts with the word \u201cactual.\u201d But the essential facts about such encounters are that the police officer is almost always armed with a gun, that the legal system tends to give broad deference to the judgments of police officers in using force, and that competent legal services to defend the interests of Black Americans involved are often unavailable or unaffordable.\nIn any given encounter between a Black American and a police officer, the most likely outcome is certainly not that the citizen will die. But the probability of such an outcome is not zero, and as a number of widely circulated videos have demonstrated, the fact that the citizen is posing no threat to the police officer is no guarantee that lethal force will not be used. And where I have been dealing with the continuing operational stress of unmasked pedestrians who might be carrying the potentially lethal novel coronavirus for 4 months, African-Americans have to approach interactions with armed police officers with trepidation and care for all of their lives. It is easy to see how dealing with such situations repeatedly could lead to diagnosed clinical conditions such as operational stress disorder, and I have come to see the street protests against police violence as an inevitable end result of continued operational stress conditions for an extended period of time lasting many decades.\nThe police often invoke the same argument \u2014 they say that in the situations to which they are required to respond, there is always the possibility that the suspects will resort to lethal force, and absent any other knowledge of the situation, they too must regard the individuals involved just as the ground soldier must approach the villager. They argue they too must make split-second decisions about the use of force, and when they err and a citizen dies, it is because they perceived an immediate physical threat at the time that required a significant use of force in response.\nI have no doubt that the police are sincere in making this argument. But their perception is profoundly shaped by the fact that as a society, we leave it to the police to address many problems that political leaders and communities are not willing or able to address. The vast bulk of activities in which police officers engage do not involve violent crime \u2014 one estimate places the amount of time dealing with violent crime at 4 percent, with serious violent crime at 1 percent.[3] More typically, they deal with issues related to the homeless, the mentally ill, those experiencing drug overdoses, those involved with minor traffic problems, school safety, and so on. For most of these types of incidents, the probability that lethal force will be necessary is very low \u2014 and it is likely that other responders, trained in de-escalation and protected but not lethally armed, could handle the vast majority of them as long as they had backup personnel properly equipped to deal with situations that turned out to involve the need for serious force.\nIn any event, the situations faced by police officers responding to a call are for the most part entirely different from those faced by ground soldiers in the field. Ground soldiers are forcible occupiers of a foreign territory, and the police are not, or at least should not be. At most, it is reasonable that they should be bringing lethal force to only a small fraction of the calls \u2014 the ones that involve violent crime \u2014 to which they currently respond.\nAt the end of the day, the COVID-19 pandemic has given me, for the first time in my life, a very small taste of what systemic oppression feels like. I\u2019ve been victimized by the pandemic for 4 months and I\u2019m having a hard time dealing with it. I can only imagine the consequences of what systemic oppression feels like to a combat soldier doing counter-insurgency work on year-long tours of duty or to a Black American living in the United States for a lifetime. It\u2019s not exactly a silver lining to the pandemic, but maybe by helping me to understand these phenomena more deeply, I can become a better person on the other end of it.\n[1] https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/covid19/pulse/mental-health.htm\n[2] https://www.kff.org/report-section/kff-health-tracking-poll-late-april-2020-economic-and-mental-health-impacts-of-coronavirus/, April 24, 2020\n[3] https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/19/upshot/unrest-police-time-violent-crime.html", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 5, "created_time": 1596997643015, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Covid 19", "Pandemic", "Racism", "Military", "Mental Health"]}, {"author": "FSI Stanford", "post_id": "29fbb558cff7", "user_id": "91ab9e44771c", "title": "\u2018A Monkey with a Grenade\u2019: Russia\u2019s Attacks on Nuclear Reactors Cross a Dangerous Line", "content": "\u2018A Monkey with a Grenade\u2019: Russia\u2019s Attacks on Nuclear Reactors Cross a Dangerous Line\nFiring on civilian nuclear facilities is an unacceptable disregard for the rules of war that endangers the entire world, not just Ukraine.\nArtem Romaniukov\nThe Chernobyl nuclear complex in Pripyat, Ukraine. The reactor zone was seized by Russian troops on 26 February, 2022.\nI am a Ukrainian national. I studied at Stanford University in 2019 and 2020 in the Ukrainian Emerging Leaders Program run by the Center on Democracy, Development and the Rule of Law at the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies.\nFor several years now, I have been a leader of environmental and anti-corruption NGOs. Among other endeavors, my team and I developed the SaveEcoBot program, which is the most popular air quality monitoring service in Ukraine and has 1.5 million users in 15 countries.\nI was with my wife and six-year-old daughter in Kyiv when Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine began. I grabbed my family and brought them to a place I thought they would be safer. Then I immediately volunteered to join the Ukrainian Defense Force. I have already seen active fire, which has resulted in a dreadful number of casualties, both for Ukrainians and Russians. But this tragedy is not just a humanitarian emergency.\nUkraine at Stanford: Meet the Third Cohort, Freeman Spogli Institute, Stanford University, 3 October 2019. From left, (1) Francis Fukuyama; (2) Artem Romaniukov; (3) Kateryna Bondar; and, (4) Pavel Vrzheshch.\nThe Pentagon estimates that 600 Russian missiles have been fired at Ukrainian targets in the first 10 days of war alone. Additionally, the infamous abandoned Chernobyl nuclear plant has been seized by Russian forces and, most recently, the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Station in Enerhodar has been attacked and occupied by armed Russian soldiers. Zaporizhzhia is the largest nuclear power plant in Europe and Russian projectiles started a localized fire in an auxiliary building on the site on March 3, 2020.\nRussian forces have also cut off the power supply to the Chernobyl reactor and containment site. This means that spent nuclear fuel is not being cooled at the site in accordance to internationally recognized standards. The head of the Chernobyl nuclear plant has said that the back-up generators have enough fuel to power the site for 48 hours. We can only guess what might happen after that. If this were not enough, there is still ongoing shelling at a nuclear research facility in Kharkiv. The current conditions there are unknown.\nIn Ukraine, we have a saying, \u201c\u043c\u0430\u0432\u043f\u0430 \u0437 \u0433\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0442\u043e\u044e,\u201d which means, \u201cLike a monkey with a grenade.\u201d Russia is playing the monkey to all of Europe.\nDespite these chaotic circumstances, the SaveEcoBot team, in coordination with the Ministry of Environmental Protection, has put a lot of effort into radiation monitoring and informing the public about changes in background radiation. We\u2019ve been set back in this critical work by the damages done to our monitoring equipment by Russians, but Ukrainian technicians are restoring the systems as fast as they can.\nThe assaults on the Chernobyl and Zaporizhzhia power plants have already had implications for the environment. The radioactive dust raised by the wheels and trucks of the Russian combat vehicles in the Chernobyl zone has raised the background radiation levels to a hundredfold excess of the normal threshold. Just imagine what chaotic attacks, with Russians shooting, firing missiles, and bombing other parts of Ukrainian territory might lead to. In Ukraine, we have a saying, \u201c\u043c\u0430\u0432\u043f\u0430 \u0437 \u0433\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0442\u043e\u044e,\u201d which means, \u201cLike a monkey with a grenade.\u201d Russia is playing the monkey to all of Europe.\nLieutenant Artem Romaniukov on active duty with the Ukrainian Defence Forces, March 2022.\nRussia continues to assert that its forces are in Ukraine for reasons of safety and security. The takeover of Chernobyl disturbed large amounts of radioactive soil, propelling it into the air. The attack on Zaporizhzhia resulted in a fire on the site of an active nuclear plant. This is not what safety looks like. To pretend that these actions are anything but a dangerous disregard for life is an insult to all sane, rational people. We are all very lucky that none of Zaporizhzhia\u2019s six reactors were hit by the tank shell that started that fire.\nRussia, the U.S. and the UK committed 20 years ago to ensure Ukraine\u2019s peaceful sovereignty in exchange for Ukraine giving up its nuclear weapons program. This agreement was built on the idea that Ukraine without nuclear weapons would never have cause to be the target of any attack. This assurance was guaranteed by the signers of the memorandum.\nBut Russia\u2019s violent attacks have proven that a nuclear threat still exists in Ukraine. It is not a threat of Ukraine\u2019s making, but one engineered by Russia\u2019s own reckless assault on our civilian nuclear facilities. The consequences of this diabolical action go well beyond a potential environmental catastrophe for Ukraine; our neighbors, including Russia itself, and even countries outside of Europe could all be affected by nuclear fallout carried on high-atmosphere winds across continent and over oceans.\nThis is not what safety looks like. To pretend that these actions are anything but a dangerous disregard for life is an insult to all sane, rational people.\nOne way to mitigate this threat and to realize security assurances to Ukraine is to implement a no-fly zone over Ukraine. The hesitance of the EU and U.S. to implement a no-fly zone is understandable. But at the same time, it is critically important to develop options and generate models for other types of no-fly zones beyond the proposals being discussed today. Such alternative options could be the key to helping prevent a Ukrainian tragedy not only in terms of nuclear security, but also in averting a similar tragedy to what the world witnessed in Aleppo.\nTo do this, Ukraine needs more military support. We have gratefully received strong military support from our allies, but even this bounty is not enough to defend our country. Stinger missiles can shoot down small, low-flying aircraft from a fairly short distance, but are useless against ballistic missiles and high-altitude bombers. We need weapons that can shoot down planes at considerable distances and altitudes, systems to detect and shoot down cruise missiles, and planes to protect our airspace. Early Russian attacks targeted our airports to deplete our air defense capabilities and frustrate our ability to get planes in the air. But we still stand. But if we want to avert a second Chernobyl or another Aleppo, we need to strengthen our air defenses.\nWe learned in 1939 that making concessions to tyrants is no plan for peace. Putin is a bully. Like all bullies, he will take as much as he can get while treating all harm \u2014 including environmental harm \u2014 as merely incidental. Like all bullies, he will stop only when he meets strong resistance. Putin and the Russia propaganda machine frame all attempts to stymie Russian aggression as not only a provocation, but a provocation that could trigger a nuclear response. Such veiled threats of nuclear attacks are a form of prior restraint meant to constrain Ukraine\u2019s allies from even suggesting that the Russian invasion is improper. But we must not accept this starkly irrational framework. Nuclear weapons are weapons of deterrence, not tools to chill diplomatic criticism.\nAny compromised nuclear facility in Ukraine inherently becomes an international problem, not just a local one. Like Putin, radioactive fallout does not respect borders.\nAmerican analysts say that they expect the Russian attacks to become increasingly more brutal. Any increased risks to civilian and military targets commensurately increases risks to nuclear sites as well. And any compromised nuclear facility in Ukraine inherently becomes an international problem, not just a local one. Like Putin, radioactive fallout does not respect borders.\nJust ten days ago, my life changed dramatically. I used to be a successful civil leader and entrepreneur with an innovative business. Now I sleep on the floor of an abandoned building with my gun in hand. My daughter knows exactly how the air raid siren sounds. But we are still Ukrainians. We are still Europeans. We still count on our allies. So to our allies, I say: close the Ukrainian sky. Provide us with enough weapons. We will do the rest.\n[Left] Artem Romaniukov with wife Olena and daughter Vasylisa; [Top] An informal meeting on 12 Febraury 2022 in Kyiv, Ukraine, of diplomats and leaders of environmental organizations, with Tobias Thyberg, Alex Riabchin, Matilda Ernkrans, Olena Pavlenko, and Artem Romaniukov; [Bottom left] Oleksandr Sereda and Artem Romaniukov during their 2020 campaigns for city council and mayor in Dnipro, Ukraine; [Bottom right] Artem Romaniukov discusses SaveEcoBot At the World Forum for Democracy in 2021.\nArtem Romaniukov is an alumnus of the 2019 cohort of the Ukrainian Emerging Leaders Program run by the Center on Democracy, Development and the Rule of Law at the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies.\nHe is the founder of SaveEcoBot, the first environmental bot in Ukraine designed to monitor information on the environment, industrial pollutants, their permits and the stages of the EIA (environmental impact assessment) procedure.\nSince the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, he has been serving in active duty for the Ukrainian Defence Forces.", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 5, "created_time": 1647206484132, "comment": [], "post_tag": []}, {"author": "FSI Stanford", "post_id": "e399f05afcfb", "user_id": "91ab9e44771c", "title": "Don\u2019t be Duped by Putin\u2019s Grievances against NATO", "content": "Don\u2019t be Duped by Putin\u2019s Grievances against NATO\nBy Yasmin Samrai, Stanford \u201922\nVladimir Putin, President of Russia\nVladimir Putin broke his months-long silence over the Ukrainian crisis during a press conference on February 1 and accused the United States of \u201cdrawing\u201d Russia into an armed conflict with its western neighbor. The Russian President is following a familiar script: deflect blame onto the West to create a pretext for aggression abroad. This victimhood act is helping to conceal Moscow\u2019s offensive foreign policy behind a defensive fa\u00e7ade that some observers find plausible or even sympathetic.\nThe idea that the West is goading Russia into a war with Ukraine is not only popular in Russia, where 50% of the population believes the West is responsible for rising tensions, but also here in the United States. The New York Times ran a front-page story with the headline \u201cIs Biden\u2019s Strategy with Putin Working, or Goading Moscow to War?\u201d Harvard professor Stephen Walt blamed the military buildup at the Ukrainian border on the \u201chubris, wishful thinking, and liberalism\u201d of the U.S. and its European allies. Meanwhile, Republicans dropped their historic hard line on Russia and accused President Joe Biden of fomenting the crisis; Senator Josh Hawley even called for abandoning America\u2019s longstanding commitment to Ukrainian membership in NATO. Taking the argument several steps further, Fox News host Tucker Carlson described the brewing conflict as a \u201cmanufactured crisis\u201d devised by \u201crestless, power-hungry neocons in Washington\u201d and mused, \u201cWhy is it disloyal to side with Russia but loyal to side with Ukraine?\u201d\nIt is deeply concerning that influential voices in the West are faulting the U.S. for the escalation of tensions in Ukraine. These commentators ignore Russia\u2019s agency in fomenting the crisis and lend credence to Putin\u2019s justification for war. Putin \u2014 it is worth remembering \u2014 annexed Crimea in 2014 and backed a violent rebellion in the Donbas region that has led to over 13,000 deaths. Putin (not Biden) has amassed over 100,000 troops on the Ukrainian border and drawn up elaborate plans to fabricate a Ukrainian attack on Russia. These are inconvenient truths for Kremlin leaders who prefer to perpetuate the myth of Russian innocence.\nIn response to Russia\u2019s campaign of intimidation, the Biden administration is sending military aid to Ukraine, fortifying NATO allies in Eastern Europe with additional troops, and threatening major sanctions. These standard actions of coercive diplomacy are designed to deter, not provoke, Russia. However much Putin wants to portray a future invasion of Ukraine as a legitimate act of retaliation against the West, his actions would betray a calculated effort to wage a war of aggression.\nBefore calling on Biden to concede to Russia\u2019s security demands, policymakers and analysts need to understand the true drivers of Putin\u2019s military buildup. The evidence available suggests that Putin resents NATO expansion not so much as a military security threat, but more so as a symbol of Russia\u2019s geopolitical decline and ideological encirclement. The prospect of \u201cLittle Russia\u201d \u2014 as Putin calls Ukraine \u2014 integrating successfully into an alliance of democracies would be a blow to his expansionist fantasies and to his illiberal regime. It would not, as he claimed in a 2014 speech to the Russian legislature after the annexation of Crimea, create a \u201cperfectly real threat to the whole of southern Russia.\u201d NATO is a mutual defense alliance that has not \u2014 and will never \u2014 attack Russia first. Nevertheless, Putin prefers to exploit and exaggerate the threat in his public rhetoric to legitimize his authoritarian rule at home and aggressive behavior abroad.\nSeeing through Smoke and Mirrors\nRussian military officers have admitted upon retirement that NATO does not present a credible national security threat, a belief the current political elite likely shares. Russia not only has a strategic advantage over NATO in conventional weapons, but also a massive nuclear deterrent to protect its territory. The positioning of NATO infrastructure near Russian borders should also matter less given that Russia can launch conventionally and nuclear equipped cruise missiles from hundreds of miles away.\nLikewise, as political scientist Kimberly Marten argues, the historical record should make clear to the Russian leadership that NATO armed forces in Eastern Europe are meant for deterrence. NATO has never attacked Russia, annexed Russian territory, nor carried out assassination attempts on Russian soil. (The same cannot be said about Russia\u2019s actions in Ukraine, Georgia, the United Kingdom, the Czech Republic, and Germany). Developments in the post-Cold War era \u2014 such as the reduction of conventional weapons far below the limits of the Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) Treaty \u2014 should have also signaled to the Russian defense establishment that NATO exists to deter, not wage, war.\nThough Putin portrays the alliance as a menacing security threat, Russian troops and artillery actually declined sharply along the country\u2019s western and southern borders from 2000 until 2014 amid two waves of NATO enlargement. Perhaps the more recent enlargements, in 2017 and 2020 respectively, alarmed Putin? This seems unlikely: the addition of Montenegro and North Macedonia, whose military forces are too small to contribute meaningfully to allied operations, were not major strategic events. No NATO missiles were even moved to their territories to threaten Russia or any other state. Armed force deployments in Central and Eastern Europe\u2019s largest NATO members \u2014 countries which lie close to the Russian borders and could hypothetically unnerve Russia \u2014 have also remained low and level or declined significantly since their accession.\nStill, there remains the possibility that a paranoid Putin mistakes NATO expansion for offensive aggression. Distinctions between offense and defense \u2014 which exist in theory \u2014 can admittedly become blurred in reality. However, major inconsistencies in Putin\u2019s anti-NATO narrative undermine this possibility. During his first two presidential terms, Putin cooperated closely with the alliance through the NATO-Russia Council and reacted to the incorporation of the Baltic States in 2004 in a relatively calm and restrained manner. He even entertained the idea of Russia someday joining NATO. More recently, between 2012 and 2015, Putin granted NATO access to its military airport in Ulyanovsk for the transit of military cargo to Afghanistan. Had the Russian President regarded the alliance as a grave security threat, he would not have allowed NATO equipment to transit through the Russian heartland. Instead, Putin has inflated and deflated the military security threat from NATO as it suits his agenda.\nFor all the complaining Putin does about Russia\u2019s encirclement by NATO, he has not taken the most logical approach to reducing the alleged security threat. He could avert future enlargements of the alliance by addressing Eastern Europe\u2019s legitimate fears of a Russian invasion and by offering their heads of state security guarantees. Instead, he has surrounded Ukraine with Russian forces on three sides, making real the threat of war, and relegated Eastern European countries to mere spectators in negotiations between Russia and the West.\nPutin\u2019s True Fear\nPutin\u2019s chief grievance regarding NATO is about power: his own power and the power of Russia in the post-Soviet space. The geographic and operational expansion of NATO has sent a painful message that Russia no longer operates at parity with the United States as the Soviet Union once did. Draft security agreements published by the Russian Foreign Ministry in December resurfaced these lingering grievances and imagined a new European security architecture in which Russia enjoys a prominent, privileged role.\nThe post-Cold War enlargement of NATO first developed into a grievance under Russian President Boris Yeltsin. In 1996, once NATO\u2019s vision for enlargement had become public, the foreign affairs columnist Flora Lewis conducted a series of interviews with senior Russian analysts, politicians, and officials to gauge the source of their resentment. To her surprise, \u201cnone [of the responses] included military, strategic, or geopolitical analysis, though many of the speakers were lifelong experts in those fields.\u201d Instead, the interview participants highlighted \u201cfeelings, perceptions of Russia\u2019s role as a great power, its need for the respect that it is due.\u201d Lewis concluded that Moscow\u2019s attempts to halt NATO expansion stemmed from \u201cRussia\u2019s unwillingness to perceive itself as anything other than one of the world\u2019s two superpowers.\u201d\nResentment about the impact of NATO enlargement on Russia\u2019s sense of prestige and identity have continued to take precedence over military and security concerns. NATO\u2019s military operation in Libya in 2011 might not have threatened Russian national security, but its symbolism hardened Putin\u2019s attitudes. NATO launched airstrikes to create safe zones for civilians fleeing Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi. With the West\u2019s support, Libyan rebel forces overthrew the regime and executed Gaddafi. In Putin\u2019s words, NATO\u2019s Libyan adventure turned \u201cthe Arab Spring\u201d into \u201cthe Arab Winter.\u201d From his perspective, a pattern had emerged: the West was conducting an imperialist policy and its attempt to shape the Balkans, North Africa, and the Middle East through military force had fomented instability across the globe. Russian diplomats reportedly used a high-stakes meeting at NATO diplomatic headquarters in January to revive grievances over the alliance\u2019s history of bombing campaigns. These discontents are revealing because complaints uttered in private offer a more reliable indicator of foreign policy drivers than public displays of outrage.\nSince his return to the presidency in 2012, Putin has inflated slights by NATO to justify, excuse, and deflect many instances of foul play \u2014 chief among them, the annexation of Crimea in 2014. In his grievance-laden address to the Russian legislature in March of that year, President Putin incited horror at the prospect of NATO forces arriving in Sevastopol (\u201cthe city of Russia\u2019s military glory\u201d). He claimed that NATO had provoked Russia, casting the invasion of Ukraine as a desperate act of defense against an impending military threat rather than an act of aggression against a far weaker neighbor and non-member state.\nHowever, the events leading up to the annexation tell another story. In 2010, Putin and his proxies had celebrated President Viktor Yanukovych\u2019s electoral victory \u2014 aided by Russian financial and media resources \u2014 as a repudiation of Ukraine\u2019s 2004 Orange Revolution. Illiberalism seemed ascendant in Ukraine following the return of a Kremlin loyalist to power. But when Yanukovych canceled preparations for signing a historic pact with the European Union in late 2013, massive demonstrations erupted throughout Ukraine. Yanukovych fled to Russia, and Putin decided to strike back against what he denounced as a \u201ccoup d\u2019\u00e9tat\u201d and the \u201cgrowth of extreme nationalism.\u201d In Putin\u2019s eyes, the 2014 Maidan Revolution was another Western attempt at regime change following the \u201ccolor revolutions\u201d in Ukraine and Georgia in the early 2000s and in Libya in 2011. Since Ukrainians and Russians are, in his view, \u201cfundamentally a single people,\u201d the consolidation of Ukraine into a liberal democracy right on Russia\u2019s borders would undermine Putin\u2019s argument for strong, autocratic rule in Russia. He was more than willing to use extraordinary measures \u2014 annexation and military intervention \u2014 to achieve this ideologically-driven aim.\nRealists may still insist that security concerns triggered Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. However, Putin\u2019s actions in 2014 belie this argument. If Putin truly saw NATO as an offensive pact \u2014 and therefore a security concern \u2014 then he would have never risked grabbing Crimea, fearing that such a move would provoke the alliance members and endanger national security. Instead, a risk-benefit calculation in which the Russian leadership deemed NATO not to pose a serious military threat led Putin to take a historic gamble and annex Crimea.\nIronically for adherents to Russia\u2019s official grievance narrative, Putin\u2019s annexation of Crimea made Russia less, not more, secure. It jolted NATO alliance members back into action after years of slashing their military budgets and triggered new spending and deployments within Eastern Europe. Russia was kicked out of the G7 and suffered severe economic contraction following Western sanctions. The absence of millions of Crimean and Donbass voters from Ukrainian elections has shifted Ukraine in a decidedly pro-European direction, increasing anti-Russia sentiment and support for NATO membership. Another Russian invasion of Ukraine would almost certainly spur even larger NATO deployments in Eastern Europe and turn neighboring countries against Russia.\nPutin regards NATO expansion as not only a threat to Russia\u2019s sphere of influence, but also to his regime, which seeks to create a buffer of failed democracies that will shield its illiberal, autocratic ideology from the West. For Central and Eastern European countries that were closed off from the West by the Iron Curtain, membership in NATO was a way for their leaders to assert a new, non-communist identity and to enhance their countries\u2019 prospects of joining the European Union. Ukraine and Georgia aspire to join NATO for these very ideological reasons in addition to their security needs. Consequently, Russian state-controlled media disseminates an increasing amount of propaganda discrediting the alliance while Putin stokes divisions by bolstering nationalist political movements within NATO countries that align with his illiberal ideology.\nGrieving and Deceiving\nPutin\u2019s grievances against the NATO military security \u201cthreat\u201d are tactical. They are designed to deflect attention from Russia\u2019s imperial intentions in Ukraine, present Russia\u2019s military buildup as a legitimate response to historical wrongs, and shift responsibility onto Washington for the breakdown in bilateral relations. This rhetorical strategy recalls the Cold War technique of \u201ctreasuring of grievances,\u201d a phenomenon identified by Philip Mosely in his 1961 compendium Negotiating with the Russians.\n\u201cThe Soviet official covers up his own aggressive behavior and lack of substantive proposals by piling on grievances, real or imaginary, against the negotiating adversary usually amid disconcerting ripostes and accusations of bad faith.\u201d\nThe West\u2019s diplomats and analysts should pay close attention to Putin\u2019s rhetoric, but be careful not to interpret his grievance narrative at face value. What Putin describes as a legitimate pursuit for the security of the Russian homeland is, in fact, an illegitimate excuse to extend Russia\u2019s territorial reach and illiberal influence into Ukraine. If power and ideological conquest are his aims, then ruling out Ukrainian membership in NATO will not appease Putin. Such a concession would not only amount to a betrayal of Ukraine but would allow Putin to go unpunished for his aggression and embolden him to create and inflate more grievances. The West must recognize the tactical nature of Russia\u2019s grievance narrative or risk letting Putin upend the post-Cold War European order in the name of security.\nAuthor Yasmin Samrai, Stanford \u201822\nYasmin Samrai \u201922 is a senior at Stanford University studying History and Economics.

However, a poorly executed detente presents its own risks to international security, creating an unstable situation in East Asia that could spiral into its own disaster.\nRight now, both domestic U.S. and international opposition to Chinese aggression seemingly preclude a detente, but the possibility is still there. If the escalating tension in the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea lead to a crisis that falls short of a military conflict and is resolved without a clear and definitive settlement, the chances of a U.S.-China detente, mirroring the U.S.-Soviet detente after the Cuban missile crisis, will grow. The possibility of war can \u2014 rightly \u2014 scare both sides, but this may also not lead to a stable peace.\nAlready the economic costs of confrontation and technological decoupling are pushing business and political leaders to advocate a modus operandi of defusing the tension. Other areas of possible cooperation might drive a push for de-escalation. A majority of Americans and allied populations, especially in Europe, consider climate change a top national security threat \u2014 and there are regular calls for compromise with China to address this issue. America\u2019s current mood of isolation and retrenchment adds to the possibility of detente.\nIt\u2019s not difficult to imagine what this could look like on the U.S. side. Washington and Beijing could agree on an informal division of influence within the so-called first island chain along the eastern edge of Asia. The United States could reduce troops in the region or revise alliance treaties to limit the scope of security guarantees, and such decisions could coincide with the host country\u2019s domestic political situation, as demonstrated by the threatened termination of the Visiting Forces Agreement with the Philippines in 2020. The join initiatives of Japan, India, Australia, and the United States \u2014 known together as the Quad \u2014 could be restricted to nonmilitary dimensions.\nWhatever the specifics, the perception of the detente would be shaped by China\u2019s own concessions, such as toning down its rhetoric against Taiwan or reducing its military presence in the South China Sea. But, realistically, none of Beijing\u2019s offers will alter its position as the dominant regional power relative to its neighbors. Without a fundamental shift in either China\u2019s aspirations or capability, a premature detente could well be perceived by allies as a quasi-abandonment of the region. And unlike the United States, there are commitments \u2014 like revanchism over Taiwan \u2014 that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) simply cannot surrender without risking domestic political crisis. Washington\u2019s regional commitments, however long-standing, would be much easier to abandon politically.\nDespite the common notion that East Asia is Washington\u2019s priority theater, the fear of abandonment remains tangible. During the Trump administration\u2019s negotiations with North Korea, South Korea and Japan were anxious that a grand bargain \u2014 where North Korea dismantled its intercontinental ballistic missiles targeting the U.S. mainland and some nuclear weapons in return for reduced U.S. presence in the peninsula \u2014 could entail their abandonment.\nA perceived U.S. withdrawal could trigger a wave of ultranationalism, precipitating an arms race, potentially even a nuclear one. Given China\u2019s and its neighbors\u2019 incompatible ideologies, coupled with Beijing\u2019s authoritarian vision for the regional order, East Asian countries are likely to balance against, rather than bandwagon with, China.\nCalls for nuclear armament are already growing in South Korea, especially among conservatives. Japan\u2019s postwar Peace Constitution will likely be untenable in the context of perceived U.S. withdrawal.\nAnalysts often point to the economic interdependence between China and its neighbors. However, growing anti-China sentiment across the region could align the foreign-policy elite and the population\u2019s drive for large-scale armament, even at its economic costs. The trade conflict between South Korea and Japan in 2019, resulting from a wave of intense nationalism, demonstrates how such sentiments might overwhelm economic rationales, especially when combined with a sense of existential threat from China.\nGranted, the original U.S.-China detente in the 1970s had exactly the opposite effect. It produced thaws across the Bamboo Curtain in East Asia. In 1972, the two Koreas produced the \u201cJuly 4th North-South Joint Statement,\u201d the first of its kind. China and Japan normalized diplomatic relations the same year. However, the situation is dramatically different today.\nIn 1972, South Korean President Park Chung-hee temporarily abandoned his anti-communist hard line for inter-Korean reconciliation, primarily because he feared a total U.S. withdrawal. He was concerned that not playing along with Washington\u2019s peace initiatives could accelerate withdrawal of U.S. forces from South Korea. He also sought to use the nominal thaw to buy time to prepare South Korea, then an impoverished nation, against a potential North Korean invasion. Lastly, Park hoped to strengthen the legitimacy of his regime, a military dictatorship, by adopting his leftist political rivals\u2019 dovish position on inter-Korean affairs.\nFrom the onset of the 1950s, Japanese elites sought reconciliation with China. Domestic business interests, along with growing socialist voices, favored improved relations with China so much that by the 1970s, even the conservative Liberal Democratic Party campaigned on pledges for reconciliation. Most importantly, Beijing at the time had neither the intent nor the capacity to pursue unrivaled hegemony in the region, particularly in the presence of the Soviet Union \u2014 its biggest perceived threat. China was even willing to push aside territorial contentions and Japan\u2019s wartime atrocities for diplomatic normalization. In fact, Japanese Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka concluded that normalizing relations with Beijing provided a \u201cstronger security guarantee than having an Asian NATO.\u201d\nIn 2022, however, the landscapes have changed radically. Seoul is ready to boost its already expanding military programs in the event of a U.S. withdrawal. The tensions in the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea constantly remind the South Korean foreign-policy establishment of two cold truths: that they could get trapped into an unwanted conflict and that South Korea might not be a strategic priority in the broader competition between the great powers. Now one of the world\u2019s largest economies, Seoul is likely to engage in independent military buildup.\nDomestic South Korean politics is also moving in the opposite direction than in 1972. It is telling that the outgoing Moon Jae-in administration faces piercing criticisms for a supposedly supine stance toward Beijing. Some conservatives advocate requesting Washington redeploy tactical nuclear weapons \u2014 which were removed in 1991 as the Cold War drew to a close \u2014 to the peninsula to elicit Beijing\u2019s cooperation in denuclearizing North Korea. Former U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s tenure has already created a rare consensus among conservatives and progressives that a strong national military should bolster the South Korean-U.S. alliance, rather than excessively relying on Washington. A further sign of U.S. retrenchment or abandonment is highly likely to kick-start discussions of weapons development, particularly after the May 2021 termination of the U.S.-South Korea Ballistic Missile Range Guidelines that prohibited Seoul\u2019s acquisition of missiles over a range of greater than 800 kilometers (about 500 miles).\nJapan has maintained surprisingly strong ties with China despite its role in the Quad and the U.S.-led alliance system. Economic interdependence is at the crux of the relations; belying calls for Western decoupling from China, Japanese companies such as Toyota are adding major investments there. Despite the hawkish factions within their cabinets and party, both former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his successor Yoshihide Suga, who has also since left office, pursued a warm policy toward China. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, Abe had invited Xi Jinping for his first visit to Japan as the CCP\u2019s general secretary. However in the face of increasingly aggressive China, Japan is intensifying cooperation with India and Vietnam, including a potential trilateral forum in the Indo-Pacific.\nIn August 2021, Japan\u2019s ruling Liberal Democratic Party held a 2+2 meeting with Taiwan\u2019s Democratic Progressive Party, infuriating Beijing. Japan has been the most vocal Asian country in criticizing China\u2019s actions in Xinjiang and Hong Kong. Ultimately, a warm China policy is strictly conditioned upon the premise that the U.S.-Japan alliance remains intact, an indispensable precondition for the 1972 normalization. A U.S.-China detente in which Japan felt betrayed would reshape Tokyo\u2019s calculations. Having already expanded its defense budget beyond the informal guideline of 1 percent of GDP, Japan is likely to embark on a more assertive, if not military, move at the sign of a dangerous U.S.-China compromise.\nUnlike Europe, which has promoted arms control \u2014 at least locally \u2014 since the end of World War II, Asia is traditionally unfamiliar with collective arms control. In fact, China\u2019s neighbors have records of mobilizing their economies for national security interests. The miracle of South Korea\u2019s economic success stemmed from a focus on heavy industry, initially intended to foster the defense industry to boost its military against North Korea.\nHostile China-Russian relations, the pillar of the original detente, has been replaced with a close partnership bordering on an outright alliance. In 2022, China\u2019s neighbors perceive substantial Chinese threats to their territorial integrity. Chinese advances in the Yellow Sea, along with its saber-rattling over the uninhabited islands known as the Senkakus in Japan and the Diaoyu in China, suggest the security fear is far from hypothetical. A report compiled by the Republic of Korea Army in March 2020 singled out the People\u2019s Liberation Army Northern Command as the largest security threat to the peninsula. Then-Japanese Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso asserted last year that \u201cOkinawa could be next\u201d after China\u2019s bid to take over Taiwan. A poorly managed U.S.-China detente in 2022 would likely generate intense security competition.\nThis is not to say that Washington and Beijing should push for a military clash. Rather, the United States should ensure that its allies\u2019 interests and concerns are reflected in any agreements signed with China. For example, signing comprehensive trade agreements with China when steel and aluminum tariffs on U.S. allies are in place could send the wrong message. Ceasing joint military exercises without consultation with allies \u2014 as Trump did after his summit with North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un in 2018 \u2014 would amplify fears of Washington\u2019s intent.\nAccommodating Beijing\u2019s technological influence in such areas as 5G mobile infrastructure, as advocated by some business interests both in the United States and across Asia, will in the long term render U.S. allies hostage to weaponized dependence. Washington has previously signed deals with adversaries that disregard its allies\u2019 interests; it defied Israel and Gulf partners\u2019 protests to sign the Iran nuclear deal in 2015, and it ignored Indian and European concerns when signing the Doha agreement with the Taliban in 2020. This should not be the case when dealing with China.\nU.S. allies should enhance cooperation among themselves, including with partners that lack a formal security treaty with Washington, and built interoperable forces. In particular, South Korea and Japan should strengthen ties not only to anchor the United States\u2019 presence in the region but also to devise a security structure that can cushion any adverse impact of a U.S.-China compromise that does not reflect their interests. Washington should proactively mediate between the two allies over the historical issues that have caused bitterness between Seoul and Tokyo, preventing them from pursuing urgent geopolitical cooperation.\nWashington and its allies can redefine collective security commitment to include nonmilitary domains such as cyberattacks and economic coercion. Chinese aggressions in the so-called gray zone are designed to test the resolve of collective defense. In particular, trade coercion and supply chain disruptions, if are not explicitly covered in the security treaties, could weaken the basis of collective security in an era when economy and security are inexorably intertwined. China has repeatedly shown its willingness to use such tools. Responses to these threats do not have to be military, either \u2014 proportional, targeted measures would prevent unconventional conflicts from spiraling out of control, as would expressly including these in security treaties. As with traditional military threats, deterrence functions when there is a solid assumption of reciprocity.\nChina on its part should not pursue hegemony over Asia by weakening U.S. alliances. China\u2019s Zhou Enlai, who spearheaded the Japan-China Joint Communique in 1972, accepted the U.S.-Japan alliance, including its coverage of Taiwan; he believed a U.S. presence was an impediment to the resurgence of Japan\u2019s militarism. Beijing should realize that its neighbors will not accept its version of the Asian order, which will likely resemble a mix of traditional Asian suzerainty and the 19th-century Concert of Europe \u2014 a hierarchical structure that overshadows sovereign equality, and where nationalism and liberalism are squashed for the sake of stability.\nAbout the author: Taehwa Hong is a junior at Stanford University (\u201923) majoring in International Relations.

She is as prim and proper as a little lady can be \u2014 but she does not alway acknowledge her poops.\nShe will hurry away from them. She will look back at them and then look at one of the other chickens with a questioning, almost accusatory stare. But she will not acknowledge her own poops. She is too pretty and too petite to have ever made anything as big and downright gross as a poop.\n\u201cIt is what it is\u2026\u201d\nIt would be nice to say that the only kind of poops my autistic brain ever worried about have been social poops, but that\u2019s not the case. I make writing poops too.\nIn college I started a novel. Along with the illustrations, I worked on it for several years. It filled a hefty 3-ring binder. It was a labor of love printed out by hand on legal pad pages because I couldn\u2019t afford a typewriter.\nIt turned out to be the equivalent of \u201ca huge writing poop.\u201d It was sickeningly melodramatic with stereotypical everything. There was no character development, and the plot went nowhere except to a surprise ending that was no surprise at all. It was all based on what I thought were a few brilliant paragraphs that turned out to be nothing special.\nDon\u2019t feel sorry for me. Don\u2019t tell me that you\u2019re sure it wasn\u2019t all that bad. It was.\n\u201c\u2026Till it ain\u2019t!\u201d\nAnd so I can\u2019t really say anything to Emily about not acknowledging her poops because that 3-ring binder sat on my shelf for over 15 years before I could finally say, \u201cI did that, and it\u2019s a huge mess!\u201d\nI was living on the 18th floor of a 21-floor apartment building at the time, and once that epiphany happened, I wasted no time in getting every page of it torn to bits to prevent possible reassembly \u2014 because that\u2019s what everyone in the whole building would want to do if they every found it. I was sure of it. Then in several generic double-layered, neatly-stapled and duct-taped paper bags, it all went down the rubbish chute.\nIt was labeled like that on the little fold-down, snap-up door. Rubbish.\n\u201cRubbish\u201d is the British way of saying it politely. \u201cTrash\u201d is what we Americans would call it, but \u201crubbish\u201d sounded better for a sophisticated high-rise in the artsy section of the city.\nBut both rubbish and trash sound the same on their way down the chute to the first floor. To me, it all sounded like \u201cPoop. Poop. Poop.\u201d\nIn retrospect, I was acting just like Emily. I didn\u2019t want to think such a messy, time-consuming failure could have come from me.\nDo I have any of those stories now?\nYou bet I do!

I keep them close by. Not to stress out over them, but just as a reminder that it\u2019s okay to miss the mark. It\u2019s okay to make mistakes \u2014 or poops.\nYou might notice these are stacked on top of an old handmade toolbox. It\u2019s where I store \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 old hand tools.

It\u2019s crafting things to benefit the lives of people. And you have to get worn down in all the right places to accomplish that.\nOn the top of the stack of books is one that was pulled two weeks after its publication date \u2014 with sold copies. (You can do that when you self-publish.)\nI had made a huge mistake by adding a very scary dream sequence to the book, and although it wasn\u2019t nearly as scary as some events found in Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales, readers that I trusted told me it was too much, even for only a dream sequence.\nThere was so much time invested in writing that book, working on the interior illustrations, and getting the cover design just right. It hurt, but pulling it was the right thing to do. I hadn\u2019t listened to my intuition when I included that part or when I submitted for publication.\nNo matter how much time and money you have invested, sometimes you must resist the urge to publish. Nothing lasting is ever published in desperation or for a dollar.\nEvery now and them, I am haunted by those copies. I even offered to buy them back from anyone who wanted a refund. But how could I ever be sure I had recovered them all?\nThe truth about stories that are poops\nPeople ask me for bags of chicken poops and used straw. Some people have even offered to buy them from me. Why? Because all of that stuff that is of no use to Emily or any of the other chicken is actually \u201cGarden Gold,\u201d the richest fertilizer for gardens.\nMy bad, awful, melodramatic, out of synch, horrible, miserable, \u201cwhat was I thinking?\u201d stories are the perfect fertilizer for my next story.

But chicken have another kind of cones that people don\u2019t have \u2014 ultraviolet light-sensing cones!\nEven so, you will never hear a chicken saying these words.\nNanny, nanny, boo-boo, I see colors better than you.\nChickens don\u2019t like to flaunt their good fortune, and so they don\u2019t mind sharing what they know with others.\nPearl\u2019s love for collecting colors and words\nColors are especially interesting to Pearl who is a collector of interesting things. She collects colorful scraps of paper that blow out of the trash truck on Trash Truck Tuesdays. She also collects words for colors.\nShe explains it quite simply.\n\u201cChickens don\u2019t truly own anything, and we are fine with that. The only thing I ever really owned was my eggshell which I outgrew when it was time to hatch.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have hands to carry things around, and although we could carry some things around in our beaks, that would really get in the way of hunting for worms and bugs.\n\u201cWords are something I can collect and take with me anywhere I want. Names of colors are the best words to collect. When I say the word, and I see the color in my mind even if I don\u2019t see it with my eyes.\u201d\nWith all of her goofiness, Pearl is quite wise.\nAlternate colors with obscure names\nNever one to be inclined toward ordinariness, Pearl began to collect alternative lists of rainbow colors beyond the red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet kind.\nColors are best judged when adjacent to other colors. They can look one way completely by themselves, but another way alongside other colors.\nAnd so this first of Pearl\u2019s alternate rainbows is presented in the context of other colors. We are using a drawing of one of her costumed \u201cComedy Coop\u201d performances to do that. The drawing includes a backdrop inspired by a poster created by Post-Impressionistic artist Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec.\n\u201cTroupe de Mlle \u00c9glantine\u201d 1896 Poster by Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec from Wikimedia Commons\nReal Life Example: When I moved into my first apartment, I was eager to paint my bedroom. I selected a paint at the local hardware store from one of their paint chip cards and spent most of a Saturday painting my bedroom. I knew it was wrong the minute I rolled out the first paint.\nBut after spending all of that time prepping the room, I was not going to give up. Maybe it looked bad because it was on a white wall. After all, I had been an art student! Surely it would look better once the entire room was finished. For a week, it felt like I was sleeping inside a pumpkin. Would a chicken have chosen better? Probably not. Chickens love pumpkins.\nThe next Saturday, it was replaced with a sleepable \u2014 but boring \u2014 beige.\nPearl\u2019s first alternate rainbow\nAs you may be able to tell from that example, Pearl and I do have many of the same color sensibilities. I like bolder and brighter colors while the other chickens prefer colors more easily found in nature like beige, tan, and eggshell.\n\nAmaranth is a reddish-rose which gets its name from the flower of the amaranth plant. It\u2019s complimentary or opposite color is shamrock.\n\nCoquelicot is a red with an orange tint. It gets its name from the wild corn poppies in France. It\u2019s complimentary or opposite color is deep sky blue.\n\nGamboge is a deep yellow similar to saffron or mustard. In tubes of paint, it is semi-transparent. Gamboge is also the color of the robes worn by Buddhist monks. It\u2019s complimentary or opposite color is ultramarine blue.\n\nScobeloff is a bluish-green that is often confused with teal. It reflects equal amounts of blue and green light and no red light. It\u2019s complimentary or opposite color is light coral.\n\nGlaucous is a slightly pale grayish-blue. It is found on the leaves of some plants and the feathers of some birds, and glaucous can be used as part of their common name. It\u2019s complimentary or opposite color is dark tan.\n\nFuchsia is a bright purple-red color. It was originally named for the flowers of the fuchsia plant. It\u2019s complimentary or opposite color is lime green.\nFun Fact: In 1859, A French chemist named Fran\u00e7ois-Emmanuel Verguin create an analine dye for this color and gave it the name fuchsia. Analine dyes, like those used on fabrics, are synthetic rather than natural. Later that same year, the name of the color was changed to magenta to celebrate the victory of the French over the Italians at the Battle of Magenta.(These are no longer identical colors. Fuchsia is now more purplish and magenta is now more reddish.)\nAnd so with all of that behind us, what was Pearl\u2019s amazing discovery about color?\nWhen you are wearing a banana hat like Carmen Miranda, you can paint your toenails and beak any color you want and still look absolutely fabulous!\nFun Fact: Carmen Miranda first wore her trademark fruit hats in the film The Gang\u2019s All Here. In the film she sang \u201cThe Lady with the Tutti Fruiti Hat,\u201d the only known musical number to ever use a xylophone made from bananas.\n\u201cThe Lady in the Tutti Fruiti Hat\u201d from \u201cThe Gang\u2019s All Here\u201d (1943) from Gregory May\nBe sure to watch the YouTube musical number. You will never think about strawberry-banana flavored Jell-O the same!\nFun Fact: Between 1961 and 1965, Jell-O introduced several mixed fruit flavors including orange-banana, lemon-lime, strawberry-banana, and pineapple- grapefruit.\nGrateful appreciation goes to William Vincent Carleton who suggested this topic based on a comment made by Christina on a previous article.

Or am I already getting it right?\n\u201cPearl and Bessie and Me \u2014 All Enjoying Evening Playtime\u201d Photograph by the Author\nWhat I call \u201cnarrator identity\u201d is made of two things about the narrator: point of view and narrator demographics. I don\u2019t do either of these the \u201cright\u201d way.\nCan I blame my autistic brain for this?\nI don\u2019t think so. Maybe. I don\u2019t know! What I do know is that this article\u2019s featured image shows I am a white male wearing my favorite chicken shoes.\nChicken Shoes\nFinding Comfort In The Familiarmedium.com\nBut the fact I\u2019m working my way through my second pair of identical chicken shoes (which aren\u2019t being made any longer) doesn\u2019t explain why I\u2019m not following the best advice of the writing authorities.\nPoint of view\nThere are two popular points of view used by most writers. There\u2019s first person (\u201cI\u201d and \u201cme\u201d) where the narrator is part of the story. There\u2019s third person (\u201che\u201d and \u201chim\u201d or \u201cshe\u201d and \u201cher\u201d) where the narrator is not a part of the story.\nBut my books use first person and third person. Some parts are written in first person because I am part of the action, but then when I step out of the action, those parts turn to third person. It\u2019s not what the writing experts advise.\nPoint of View Options for Your Children's Book - dummies\nThe primary point of view (POV) decision you have to make before you can write even one sentence of your children's\u2026www.dummies.com\nHere is how I explain it in on the copyright notice page.\nThis book must be considered a work of fiction because the author was not a direct observer of all that happened. He relied on the accounts of his chickens to fill in those missing details. While he trusts them for their honesty, there could be a few places where his imagination may have gotten the best of him.\nMy chickens have told me a lot about what happens when I\u2019m not around. And of course I listen to what they tell me about their thoughts and feelings. When I write, I am writing our story.\nNarrator (and often main character) demographics\nOriginally, the narrator was referred to as \u201che\u201d and \u201chim,\u201d but that changed when I began the series Once Through a Garden Gate.\nThe narrator is now simply called \u201cThe Big Scary Thing\u201d and \u201cThe Gardener\u201d without pronouns. (Some may think \u201cThe Chicken Tender\u201d might be better, but we both know how wrong that would be!)\nI don\u2019t want the narrator\u2019s identity to get in the way of the chickens. After all, these books are about chickens. Without pronouns for the narrator, it does make for smoother reading aloud. A mother, grandmother, or aunt can read aloud something like this without the \u201cear catch\u201d of pronouns.\nFinally Bessie said to Gracie, \u201cHe just doesn\u2019t get it yet, does he?\u201d\nWithout pronouns, the story sounds more like it might have happened to the person who is reading it, so \u201cThe Gardener\u201d seems to work nicely.\nMore importantly, these books are about universal feelings. Those are feelings anyone can experience regardless of their gender, race, age, or other characteristics. Although causation and reaction may be different, love and joy or pain and sorrow are felt the same.\nIn the series Once Through a Garden Gate, the gender, age, race, and other demographics of the narrator are never given. It\u2019s not what the writing experts advise.\nWhy It\u2019s Important for Kids to See Themselves in Books\nFor far too long, children\u2019s books that featured culturally diverse characters were hard to come by. But, that has\u2026www.scholastic.com\nPerhaps I am wrong about this, but I really hope not. I\u2019d like to think that children can relate to what my chickens are feeling even though children don\u2019t look like them.\nAn example of two universal feelings: awkwardly different and deeply loved\nMishaps seemed to follow Pearl. She would accidentally turn over the food dish or the water bottle. She would even climb on top of Blanche to get to where she wanted to go simply because it was the shortest distance.\nThrough it all, no matter how troublesome Pearl might be, Blanche kept loving her.\nPearl never quite understood how to be what the others called \u201ca good, normal chicken.\u201d It was something I didn\u2019t understand myself. I only knew she was different.\nBut Pearl did not see herself as being different. She looked just like Blanche except she was a little smaller. They were both White Plymouth Rocks like the big one on top of The Chicken Place Restaurant. To her way of thinking, that should be enough.\nI had never wanted any of my chickens to know about The Chicken Place Restaurant, but I let it slip out one day when I was trying to convince Pearl that she really was a good, normal chicken.\n\u201cYou and Blanche look just like the big statue on top of The Chicken Place Restaurant that everyone sees and admires. That big chicken is sort of a celebrity in our neighborhood.\u201d\n\u201cSo why don\u2019t you take us all out to dinner at this restaurant? After all, it is called The Chicken Place Restaurant. Then the other chickens here would see for themselves that there is nothing wrong with me. They might treat Blanche and me like celebrities and not the newest chickens who do not know as much as they do.\u201d\n\u201cPearl. It doesn\u2019t quite work like that.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean? If it is any kind of respectable restaurant, they will have a table big enough for the four of us, and you too, of course. We can all sit in booster seats and wear bibs. We do get messy sometimes, and for some reason, I always seem to get the messiest.\u201d\nI was unsure how to explain it to her. Even though it is named The Chicken Place Restaurant, that is only because chickens are on the menu, not seated at a table. It was not going to be easy or comfortable to explain how \u201cWe Serve Chicken\u201d is not the same as \u201cWe Serve Chickens.\u201d\n\u201cIt has to do with the menu,\u201d I began.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about that. If the menu has no pictures, they should not mind if you read the menu to us.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s like this, Pearl \u2014 \u201d\n\u201cYes?\u201d\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have eat-in dining anymore,\u201d I finally said. \u201cIt\u2019s only take-out.\u201d\nThat was indeed true, and it seemed to satisfy her curiosity for the time being.\n\u201cBut the big white chicken on the roof is still a celebrity, right?\u201d\n\u201cMost definitely.\u201d\nAnd so, Pearl set out to do her best at copying everything Blanche did even though Blanche was just as new to the world as she was. Most importantly, Pearl never gave up hope of one day finally figuring it all out.\nAnd so while I am not like Pearl by copying everything the writing experts do, I am like Pearl in not giving up hope that one day I will finally figure it all out.\nThis article about the real restaurant in our neighborhood also explains how it was successful even when they didn\u2019t follow the best advice.

Wade", "content": "My Statement with Michelle on the Draft Supreme Court Decision to Overturn Roe v. Wade\nGetty Images\nToday, millions of Americans woke up fearing that their essential freedoms under the Constitution were at risk.\nIf the Supreme Court ultimately decides to overturn the landmark case of Roe v. Wade, then it will not only reverse nearly 50 years of precedent \u2014 it will relegate the most intensely personal decision someone can make to the whims of politicians and ideologues.\nFew, if any, women make the decision to terminate a pregnancy casually \u2014 and people of goodwill, across the political spectrum, can hold different views on the subject. But what Roe recognized is that the freedom enshrined in the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution requires all of us to enjoy a sphere of our lives that isn\u2019t subject to meddling from the state \u2014 a sphere that includes personal decisions involving who we sleep with, who we marry, whether or not to use contraception, and whether or not to bear children.\nAs the court has previously determined, our freedoms are not unlimited \u2014 society has a compelling interest in other circumstances, for example, in protecting children from abuse or people from self-harm \u2014 and the framework constructed by Roe and subsequent Court decisions allowed legislatures to impose greater restrictions on abortion later in pregnancy. But this draft decision doesn\u2019t seek to balance these interests. Instead, it simply forces folks to give up any constitutionally recognized interest in what happens to their body once they get pregnant. Under the Court\u2019s logic, state legislatures could dictate that women carry every pregnancy to term, no matter how early it is and no matter what circumstances led to it \u2014 even rape or incest.\nThe consequences of this decision would be a blow not just to women, but to all of us who believe that in a free society, there are limits to how much the government can encroach on our personal lives. And this decision is unlikely to significantly reduce abortions, which have been steadily going down over the past several decades thanks in large part to better access to contraception and education. Instead, as we\u2019ve already begun to see in states with restrictive abortion laws, those women with means would travel to states where abortion remains legal and safe. Meanwhile, those without enough money or access to transportation or ability to take off from school or work would face the same circumstances most women faced before Roe, desperately seeking out illegal abortions that inevitably pose grave risks to their health, their future ability to bear children, and sometimes their lives.\nThat\u2019s a result none of us should want. But it should serve as a powerful reminder of the central role the courts play in protecting our rights \u2014 and of the fact that elections have consequences.\nA clear majority of Americans support Roe. Yet we recognize that while many are angry and frustrated by this report, some of those who support Roe may feel helpless and instinctively turn back to their work, or families, or daily tasks \u2014 telling themselves that because this outcome may have been predictable, there\u2019s nothing any of us can do.\nIf that\u2019s you, we ask you to think about the college student waking up after her date forced her into unprotected sex. Think about the couple that tried to have children for years, who are without any options when faced with the tragic reality of an unviable pregnancy. Think of any of the hundreds of thousands of women each year who deserve the dignity and freedom of making a decision that is right for their bodies and their circumstances.\nYou might be one of those people. Or you might know some of them by name. If you don\u2019t, ask yourself if you know everyone\u2019s whole story.\nBut we\u2019re not asking you to just think about these people. We\u2019re asking you to join with the activists who\u2019ve been sounding the alarm on this issue for years \u2014 and act. Stand with them at a local protest. Volunteer with them on a campaign. Join with them in urging Congress to codify Roe into law. And vote alongside them on or before November 8 and in every other election. Because in the end, if we want judges who will protect all, and not just some, of our rights, then we\u2019ve got to elect officials committed to doing the same.", "comment_count": 58, "like_count": 7671, "created_time": 1651592547132, "comment": [{"user_id": "9e422a605dc5", "comment_time": 1651592547132, "comment": "My Statement with Michelle on the Draft Supreme Court Decision to Overturn Roe v.

They\u2019re actively subverting democracy, they\u2019re undermining hard-won human rights, they\u2019re ignoring international law.\nDemocratic backsliding is not restricted to distant lands. Right here, in the United States of America, we just saw a sitting president deny the clear results of an election and help incite a violent insurrection at the nation\u2019s capital. Not only that, but a majority of his party, including many who occupy some of the highest offices in the land, continue to cast doubt on the legitimacy of the last election, and are using it to justify laws that restrict the vote, making it easier to overturn the will of the people in states where they hold power.\nBut for those of us who believe in democracy and the rule of law, this should serve as a wake-up call. We have to admit that, at least in the years since the Cold War ended, democracies have grown dangerously complacent.\nToo often, we\u2019ve taken freedom for granted. What recent events remind us, is that democracy is neither inevitable nor self-executed. Citizens like us have to nurture it. We have to tend to it and fight for it, and as our circumstances change, we have to be willing to look at ourselves critically, making reforms that can allow democracy, not just to survive, but to thrive.\nThat won\u2019t be easy. A lot of factors have contributed to the weakening of democratic institutions around the world. One of those factors is globalization which has helped lift hundreds and millions out of poverty, most notably in China and India, but which, along with automation has also ended entire economies, accelerated global inequality, and left millions of others feeling betrayed and angry at existing political institutions.\nThere is the increased mobility and urbanization of modern life, which further shakes up societies, including existing family structures and gender roles. Here at home, we\u2019ve seen a steady decline in the number of people participating in unions, civic organizations and houses of worship, mediating institutions that once served as a kind of communal glue.\nInternationally, the rise of China as well as chronic political dysfunction, here in the U.S. and in Europe, not to mention the near collapse of the global financial system in 2008, has made it easier for leaders in other countries to discount democracy\u2019s appeal. And as once marginalized groups demand a seat at the table, politicians have found a new audience for old-fashioned appeals to racial and ethnic, religious or national solidarity.\nIn the rush to protect us from them, virtues like tolerance and respect for democratic processes start to look, not just expendable, but like a threat to our way of life.\nSo if we\u2019re going to strengthen democracy, we\u2019ll have to address all of these strengths. We\u2019ll have to come up with new models for a more inclusive, equitable capitalism. We\u2019ll have to reform our political institutions in ways that allow people to be heard and give them real agency. We\u2019ll have to tell better stories about ourselves and how we can live together, despite our differences.\nAnd that\u2019s why I\u2019m here today, on Stanford\u2019s campus, in the heart of Silicon Valley, where so much of the digital, because I\u2019m convinced that right now one of the biggest impediments to doing all of this, indeed, of the biggest reasons for democracies weakening is the profound change that\u2019s taking place in how we communicate and consume information.\nNow let me start off by saying I am not a Luddite, although it is true that sometimes I have to ask my daughters how to work basic functions on my phone. I am amazed by the internet. It\u2019s connected billions of people around the world, put the collected knowledge of centuries at our fingertips. It\u2019s made our economies vastly more efficient, accelerated medical advances, opened up new opportunities, allowed people with shared interests to find each other.\nI might never have been elected president if it hadn\u2019t been for websites like, and I\u2019m dating myself, MySpace, MeetUp and Facebook who allowed an army of young volunteers to organize, raise money, spread our message. That\u2019s what elected me.\nAnd since then, we\u2019ve all witnessed the ways that activists use social media platforms to register dissent and shine a light on injustice and mobilize people on issues like climate change and racial justice.\nSo the internet and the accompanying information revolution has been transformative. And there\u2019s no turning back. But like all advances in technology, this progress has had unintended consequences that sometimes come at a price. And in this case, we see that our new information ecosystem is turbocharging some of humanity\u2019s worst impulses.\nNot all of these effects are intentional or even avoidable. They\u2019re simply the consequence of billions of humans suddenly plugged in one instant 24/7 global information stream. Forty years ago, if you were a conservative in rural Texas, you weren\u2019t necessarily offended by what was going on in San Francisco\u2019s Castro District because you didn\u2019t know what was going on.\nIf you lived in an impoverished Yemeni village, you had no insight into the spending habits of the Kardashians. For some such exposure may be eye opening, perhaps even liberating, but others may experience that exposure as a direct affront to their traditions, their belief systems, their place in society. Then you have the sheer proliferation of content and the splintering of information and audiences. That\u2019s made democracy more complicated.\nI\u2019ll date myself again. If you were watching TV here in the United States between about 1960 and 1990, I Dream of Jeannie, The Jeffersons. Chances are you were watching one of the big three networks. And this had its own problems, particularly the ways in which programing often excluded voices and perspectives of women and people of color and other folks outside of the mainstream. But it did fortify a sense of shared culture and it came to the news, at least, citizens across the political spectrum tended to operate using a shared set of facts, what they saw, what they heard from Walter Cronkite or David Brinkley or others.\nToday, of course, we occupy entirely different media realities, fed directly into our phones. You don\u2019t even have to look up. And it\u2019s made all of us more prone to what psychologists call confirmation bias, the tendency to select facts and opinions that reinforce our preexisting worldviews and filter out those that don\u2019t.\nSo inside our personal information bubbles, our assumptions, our blind spots, our prejudices aren\u2019t challenged, they\u2019re reinforced. And naturally we\u2019re more likely to react negatively to those consuming different facts and opinions. All of which deepens existing racial and religious and cultural divides.\nIt\u2019s fair to say then that some of the current challenges we face are inherent to a fully connected world. Our brains aren\u2019t accustomed to taking in this much information this fast, and a lot of us are experiencing overload. But not all problems we\u2019re seeing now are a byproduct of this new technology. They\u2019re also the result of very specific choices made by the companies that have come to dominate the internet generally and social media platforms in particular. Decisions that, intentionally or not, have made democracies more vulnerable.\nNow I\u2019m at Stanford. Most of you know the story by now. Twenty years ago, pillars of web search were comprehensiveness, relevance and speed. But with the rise of social media and the need to better understand people\u2019s online behavior, in order to sell more advertising, companies want to collect more data. More companies optimized for personalization, engagement and speed. And unfortunately, it turns out that inflammatory, polarizing content attracts and engages.\nOther features of these platforms have compounded the problem. For example, the way content looks on your phone, as well as the veil of anonymity that platforms provide their users. A lot of times this makes it impossible to tell the difference between, say, a peer-reviewed article by Dr. Anthony Fauci and a miracle cure being pitched by a huckster.\nAnd meanwhile, sophisticated actors from political consultants to commercial interests, to intelligence arms of foreign powers can game platform algorithms or artificially boost the reach of the deceptive or harmful messages.\nOf course, this business model has proven to be wildly successful. For more and more of us, search and social media platforms aren\u2019t just our window into the internet; they serve as our primary source of news and information.\nNo one tells us that the window is blurred, subject to unseen distortions and subtle manipulations. All we see is a constant feed of content where useful factual information and happy diversions, and cat videos, flow alongside lies, conspiracy theories, junk science, quackery, White supremacist, racist tracts, misogynist screeds. And over time, we lose our capacity to distinguish between fact, opinion and wholesale fiction. Or maybe we just stop caring.\nAnd all of us, including our children, learn that if you want to rise above the crowd, above the din, if you want to be liked and shared, and yes, go viral! Then peddling controversy, outrage, even hate often gives you an edge.\nNow it\u2019s true, tech companies and social media platforms are not the only distributors of toxic information. I promise you; I spend a lot of time in Washington, right?\nIn fact, some of the most outrageous content on the Web originates from traditional media. What social media platforms have done, though, thanks to their increasing market dominance and their emphasis on speed, is accelerate the decline of newspapers and other traditional news sources.\nThere are still brand name newspapers and magazines, not to mention network news broadcasts, NPR other outlets that have adapted to the new digital environment while maintaining the highest standards of journalistic integrity. But as more and more ad revenue flows to the platforms that disseminate the news, rather than that money going to the newsrooms that report it, publishers, reporters, editors, they all feel the pressure to maximize engagement in order to compete.\nReporters start worrying about, \u201cI gotta tweet something, cause if I don\u2019t, I may be out of a job.\u201d That\u2019s the information environment we now live in. It\u2019s not just that these platforms have \u2014 and there are exceptions \u2014 been largely agnostic regarding the kind of information available and connections made on their sites. It\u2019s that in the competition between truth and falsehood, cooperation and conflict, the very design of these platforms seems to be tilting us in the wrong direction.\nAnd we\u2019re seeing the results take over. The fact that scientists developed safe, effective vaccines in record time is an unbelievable achievement. And yet despite the fact that we\u2019ve now, essentially clinically tested the vaccine on billions of people worldwide, around 1 in 5 Americans is still willing to put themselves at risk and put their families at risk rather than get vaccinated. People are dying because of misinformation.\nI already mentioned the 2020 presidential election. President Trump\u2019s own attorney general has said that the Justice Department uncovered no evidence of widespread voter fraud. A review of the ballots in Arizona\u2019s largest county, the results of which were endorsed by some pretty courageous local Republicans, because many of them were harassed and received death threats, actually more votes for President Biden and fewer votes for President Trump. And yet today, as we speak, a majority of Republicans still insist that President Biden\u2019s victory was not legitimate. That\u2019s a lot of people.\nIn Myanmar, it\u2019s been well-documented that hate speech shared on Facebook played a role in the murderous campaign targeting the Rohingya community. Social media platforms have been similarly implicated in fanning ethnic violence in Ethiopia, far-right extremism in Europe.\nAuthoritarian regimes and strongmen around the world from China to Hungary, the Philippines. Brazil have learned to conscript social media platforms to turn their own populations against groups they don\u2019t like, whether it\u2019s ethnic minorities, the LGBTQ community, journalists, political opponents. And of course, autocrats like Putin have used these platforms as a strategic weapon against democratic countries that they consider a threat.\nPeople like Putin and Steve Bannon, for that matter, understand it\u2019s not necessary for people to believe this information in order to weaken democratic institutions. You just have to flood a country\u2019s public square with enough raw sewage. You just have to raise enough questions, spread enough dirt, plant enough conspiracy theorizing that citizens no longer know what to believe.\nOnce they lose trust in their leaders, in mainstream media, in political institutions, in each other, in the possibility of truth, the game\u2019s won. And as Putin discovered leading up to the 2016 election, our own social media platforms are well designed to support such a mission, such a project.\nRussians could study and manipulate patterns in the engagement ranking system on a Facebook or YouTube. And as a result, Russian\u2019s state sponsor trolls could almost guarantee that whatever disinformation they put out there would reach millions of Americans. And that the more inflammatory the story, the quicker it spread.\nI\u2019ve been writing my memoirs lately, including reflections on events leading up to that election. The regrets I have, the things I might have missed. No one in my administration was surprised that Russia was attempting to meddle in our election. They had been doing that for years. Or that it was using social media in these efforts.\nBefore the election, I directed our top intelligence officials to expose those efforts to the press and to the public. What does still nag at me, though? Was my failure to fully appreciate at the time just how susceptible we had become to lies and conspiracy theories, despite having spent years being a target of disinformation myself.\nPutin didn\u2019t do that. He didn\u2019t have to. We did it to ourselves.\nSo where do we go from here?\nIf we do nothing, I am convinced the trends that we\u2019re seeing will get worse. New technologies are already challenging the way we regulate currency, how we keep consumers safe from fraud. And with the emergence of AI, disinformation will grow more sophisticated. I\u2019ve already seen demonstrations of deepfake technology that show what looks like me on a screen saying stuff I did not say. It\u2019s a strange experience, people.\nWithout some standards, implications of this technology, for our elections, for our legal system, for our democracy, for rules of evidence, for our entire social order are frightening and profound.\nFortunately, I am convinced that it is possible to preserve the transformative power and promise of the open internet, while at least mitigating the worst of its harms. And I believe that those of you in the tech community, soon to be in the tech community, not just its corporate leaders, but employees at every level have to be part of the solution.\nThe essence of this place, what put Silicon Valley on the map is a spirit of innovation. That\u2019s what led to the globally integrated internet, and all its remarkable applications. What we\u2019ve now learned is the product has some design flaws. There are some bugs in the software. We don\u2019t have to just leave it like that. Through the same spirit of innovation. We can make it better.\nSo I want to make some general suggestions for what that work might look like. But before I do, let me offer a few stipulations so we don\u2019t get bogged down in some well-worn, not always productive arguments.\nNumber one, media companies, tech companies, social media platforms did not create the divisions in our society, here or in other parts of the world. Social media did not create racism or white supremacist groups. It didn\u2019t create the kind of ethno-nationalism that. Putin\u2019s enraptured with. It didn\u2019t create sexism, class conflict, religious strife, greed, envy, all the deadly sins. All these things existed long before the first tweet or Facebook poke.\nSolving the disinformation problem won\u2019t cure all that ails our democracies or tears at the fabric of our world, but it can help tamp down divisions and let us rebuild the trust and solidarity needed to make our democracy stronger. And to take on anti-women mentalities, and deal with racism in our society, and build bridges between people. It can do that.\nSecond, we aren\u2019t going to get rid of all offensive or inflammatory content on the web. That is a strawman. We\u2019d be wrong to try. Freedom of speech is at the heart of every democratic society in America those protections are enshrined in the First Amendment to our Constitution. There\u2019s a reason it came first in the Bill of Rights.\nI\u2019m pretty close to a First Amendment absolutist. I believe that in most instances the answer to bad speech is good speech. I believe that the free, robust, sometimes antagonistic exchange of ideas produces better outcomes and a healthier society.\nNo Democratic government can or should do what China, for example, is doing, simply telling people what they can and cannot say or publish while trying to control what others say about their country abroad. And I don\u2019t have a lot of confidence that any single individual or organization, private or public, should be charged or do a good job at determining who gets to hear what.\nThat said, the First Amendment is a check on the power of the state. It doesn\u2019t apply to private companies like Facebook or Twitter, any more than it applies to editorial decisions made by The New York Times or Fox News. It never has. Social media companies already make choices about what is or is not allowed on their platforms and how that content appears, both explicitly through content, moderation, and implicitly through algorithms.\nThe problem is, we often don\u2019t know what principles govern those decisions. And on an issue of enormous public interest, there has been little public debate and practically no democratic oversight.\nThree, any rules we come up with to govern the distribution of content on the Internet will involve value judgments. None of us are perfectly objective. What we consider unshakeable truth today may prove to be totally wrong tomorrow. But that doesn\u2019t mean some things aren\u2019t truer than others or that we can\u2019t draw lines between opinions, facts, honest mistakes, intentional deceptions.\nWe make these distinctions all the time in our daily lives, at work, in school, at home, in sports, and we can do the same when it comes to Internet content, as long as we agree on a set of principles, some core values to guide the work. So, in the interest of full transparency, here\u2019s what I think our guiding principles should be.\nThe way I\u2019m going to evaluate any proposal touching on social media and the Internet is whether it strengthens or weakens the prospects for a healthy, inclusive democracy, whether it encourages robust debate and respect for our differences, whether it reinforces rule of law and self-governance, whether it helps us make collective decisions based on the best available information, and whether it recognizes the rights and freedoms and dignity of all our citizens.\nWhatever changes contribute to that vision, I\u2019m for. Whatever erodes that vision, I\u2019m against, just so you know. (Laughter.)\nAll right. With that as my starting point, I believe we have to address not just the supply of toxic information, but also the demand for it. On the supply side, tech platforms need to accept that the play a unique role in how we, as a people and people around the world, are consuming information and that their decisions have an impact on every aspect of society. With that power comes accountability, and in democracies like ours, at least, the need for some democratic oversight.\nFor years, social media companies have resisted that kind of accountability. They\u2019re not unique in that regard. Every private corporation wants to do anything it wants. So, the social media platforms called themselves neutral platforms with no editorial role in what their users saw. They insisted that the content people see on social media has no impact on their beliefs or behavior \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 even though their business models and their profits are based on telling advertisers the exact opposite.\nNow, the good news is, is that almost all the big tech platforms now acknowledge some responsibility for content on their platforms, and they\u2019re investing in large teams of people to monitor it. Given the sheer volume of content, this strategy can feel like a game of whack-a-mole. Still, in talking to people at these companies, I believe they are sincere in trying to limit content that engages in hate speech, encourages violence, or poses a threat to public safety. They genuinely are concerned about it and they want to do something about it.\nBut while content moderation can limit the distribution of clearly dangerous content, it doesn\u2019t go far enough. Users who want to spread disinformation have become experts at pushing right up to the line of what at least published company policies allow. And at those margins, social media platforms tend not to want to do anything, not just because they don\u2019t want to be accused of censorship, because they still have a financial incentive to keep as many users engaged as possible. More importantly, these companies are still way too guarded about how exactly their standards operate, or how their engagement ranking systems influence what goes viral and what doesn\u2019t.\nNow, some companies have been taking the next step in managing toxic content, experimenting with new product designs that, to use just one example, add friction to slow the spread of potentially harmful content. And that kind of innovation is a step in the right direction. It should be applauded, but I also think decisions like this shouldn\u2019t be left solely to private interests. These decisions affect all of us, and just like every other industry that has a big impact in our society, that means these big platforms need to be subject to some level of public oversight and regulation.\nRight now, a lot of the regulatory debate centers on Section 230 of the United States code, which, as some of you know, says the tech companies generally can\u2019t be held liable for most content that other people post on their platforms. But let\u2019s face it, these platforms are not like the old phone company.\nWhile I\u2019m not convinced that wholesale repeal of Section 230 is the answer, it is clear that tech companies have changed dramatically over the last 20 years. And we need to consider reforms to Section 230 to account for those changes, including whether platforms should be required to have a higher standard of care, when it comes to advertising on their site.\nAnd by the way, I believe and I\u2019ve seen that regulation and innovation are not mutually exclusive. Here in the United States, we have a long history of regulating new technologies in the name of public safety, from cars and airplanes to prescription drugs to appliances. And while companies initially always complain that the rules are going to stifle innovation and destroy the industry, the truth is, is that a good regulatory environment usually ends up spurring innovation because it raises the bar on safety and quality.\nAnd it turns out that innovation can meet that higher bar. And if consumers trust that new technology is doing right by them and is safe, they\u2019re more likely to use it. And if properly structured, regulation can promote competition and keep incumbents from freezing out new innovators.\nA regulatory structure, a smart one, needs to be in place, designed in consultation with tech companies, and experts and communities that are affected, including communities of color and others that sometimes are not well represented here in Silicon Valley, that will allow these companies to operate effectively while also slowing the spread of harmful content. In some cases, industry standards may replace or substitute for regulation, but regulation has to be part of the answer.\nBeyond that, tech companies need to be more transparent about how they operate. So much of the conversation around disinformation is focused on what people post. The bigger issue is what content these platforms promote. Algorithms have evolved to the point where nobody on the outside of these companies can accurately predict what they\u2019ll do, unless they\u2019re really sophisticated and spend a lot of time tracking it. And sometimes, even the people who build them aren\u2019t sure. That\u2019s a problem.\nIn a democracy, we can rightly expect companies to subject the design of their products and services to some level of scrutiny. At minimum, they should have to share that information with researchers and regulators who are charged with keeping the rest of the safe.\nThis may seem like an odd example and forgive me, you vegans out there, but if a meat packing company has a proprietary technique to keep our hot dogs fresh and clean, they don\u2019t have to reveal to the world what that technique is. They do have to tell the meat inspector.\nIn the same way, tech companies should be able to protect their intellectual property while also following certain safety standards that we, as a country, not just them, have agreed are necessary for the greater good. And we\u2019ve seen this as part of the Platform Accountability and Transparency Act that\u2019s being proposed by a bipartisan group of senators here in the United States. It doesn\u2019t happen often. And we\u2019ve also seen it negotiated in Europe as part of the European Union\u2019s Digital Services Act.\nAgain, we don\u2019t expect tech companies to solve all these problems on their own. There are folks in these companies and in this community who have shown extraordinary good faith in some cases, but that\u2019s not enough.\nWe do expect these companies to affirm the importance of our democratic institutions, not dismiss them, and to work to find the right combination of regulation and industry standards that will make democracy stronger. And because companies recognize the often dangerous relationship between social media, nationalism, domestic hate groups, they do need to engage with vulnerable populations about how to put better safeguards in place to protect minority populations, ethnic populations, religious minorities, wherever they operate.\nFor example, in the United States, they should be working with, not always contrary to, those groups that are trying to prevent voter suppression and specifically has targeted black and brown communities. In other words, these companies need to have some other North Star other than just making money and increasing market share. Fix the problem that, in part, they helped create, but also to stand for something bigger.\nAnd to the employees of these companies, and to the students here at Stanford who might well be future employees of these companies, you have the power to move things in the right direction. You can advocate for change; you can be part of this redesign. And if not, you can vote with your feet and go work with companies that are trying to do the right thing.\nThat\u2019s on the supply side. Now, let\u2019s talk about the demand side of the equation.\nIt starts with breaking through our information bubbles. Look, I understand that there are a whole bunch of people in this country who have views diametrically opposed to mine. I promise, they tell me all the time. (Laughter.) I get it. I am not suggesting that all of us have to spend our days reading opinions we disagree with or looking for media stories that fundamentally don\u2019t share our values, but it is possible to broaden our perspectives.\nAn interesting study came out recently, and this is just one study, so take it with a grain of salt. The researchers paid a large group of regular FOX News watchers to watch CNN for almost a month. And these were not swing voters, these were hard core, Hannity, Carlson fans, right? They\u2019re right there.\nAnd what the researchers found was that, at the end of the month, people\u2019s views on certain issues, like whether voting by mail should be allowed or whether electing Joe Biden would lead to more violence against police, on some of these issues, their views are changed by five, eight, 10 points. These people didn\u2019t suddenly turn into liberals. I am sure they still don\u2019t like me. (Laughter.) But at the margins, they had reshaped their perspectives in meaningful ways.\nStudies like this show our opinions aren\u2019t fixed, and that means our divisions aren\u2019t fixed either if we can agree on some common baseline effects and agree on some common baseline of how we debate and sort out our disagreements.\nThe divisions that exist in this country aren\u2019t going away any time soon, but the information we get, the stories we tell ourselves can, as Lincoln said, encourage the better angels of our nature. It can also encourage the worst. And a healthy democracy depends on our better angels being encouraged.\nAs citizens, we have to take it upon ourselves to become better consumers of news, looking at sources, thinking before we share and teaching our kids to become critical thinkers who know how to evaluate sources and separate opinion from fact. In fact, a number of school districts around the country are working to train kids in this kind of online media literacy, not around any particular ideological perspective, but just how to check a source. Does this person who\u2019s typing in his mother\u2019s basement in his underwear seem a credible authority on climate change? (Laughter.) That\u2019s something we should all want to support.\nPart of this project is also going to require us to find creative ways to reinvigorate quality journalism, including local journalism, because one of the challenges we have, part of the reason that you\u2019ve seen increased polarization, is all media has become nationalized and hence, more ideological.\nAnd one encouraging trend has been a number of nonprofit newsrooms beginning to pop up in places like Baltimore, Houston, my hometown of Chicago, all aimed at providing essential coverage of what\u2019s happening locally and in statehouses. And that\u2019s an example of how new models of journalism are possible, along with smart ways for communities to reinvigorate local news.\nCompanies here in Silicon Valley that have reaped some of the largest benefits from the Internet revolution, those companies need to find ways to support them. And I know Congress has been engaged with some of these companies to look at how can you get more revenue back into local news.\nWe should also think about how to build civic institutions for a new generation. I mentioned the decline of what are called mediating institutions \u2014 unions, Rotary clubs, bowling leagues, right? But the thing is, studies show that if you participated in an organization, like Student Council, which I did not \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 or the Boy Scouts or Girl Scouts, groups that allow young people to practice learning, debating, voting, making decisions together, then you\u2019re much more likely to vote and be an active citizen.\nThose habits matter. We need to figure out ways to give young people and the rest of us the chance to build up civic muscles. And we have to figure out how to do that, not just in the real world, but also on virtual platforms where young people are spending time.\nThis is one of the things we\u2019re focused on at the Obama Foundation. And great work is also being done by organizations like the MIT Center for Constructive Communication, which is making online conversations more civil and productive, and the News Literacy Project, which is building new tools to help people separate fact from fiction.\nAnd finally, it is important to reinforce these norms and values on an international scale. This is a globally integrated Internet. There\u2019s value in that, but it means that as we\u2019re shaping roles, we have to engage the rest of the world.\nCountries like China and Russia have already tried to paint democracy as unworkable, and authoritarianism is the only path to order. China\u2019s built a great firewall around the Internet, turning it into a vehicle for domestic indoctrination and surveillance. And now, they\u2019re exporting some of those same technologies, those same with similar product designs to other countries.\nIn Russia, Putin has weaponized ethnonationalism through disinformation, waging hate campaigns against domestic opponents, delegitimizing democracy itself. And of course, he\u2019s escalated such efforts as part of his war in Ukraine.\nAs the world\u2019s leading democracy, we have to set a better example. We should be at the lead on these discussions internationally, not in the rear. Right now, Europe is forging ahead with some of the most sweeping legislation nearest regulate the abuses that are seen in big tech companies. And their approach may not be exactly right for the United States, but it points to the need for us to coordinate with other democracies.\nWe need to find our voice in this global conversation, and we\u2019ve done it before. After World War II, after witnessing how mass media and propaganda had fanned the flames of hate, we put a framework in place that would ensure our broadcast system was compatible with democracy. We required a certain amount of children\u2019s educational programing, instituted the Fairness Doctrine. Newsrooms changed practices to maximize accuracy.\nAnd the task before us is harder now. We can\u2019t go back to the way things were with three TV stations and newspapers in every major city, not just because of the proliferation of content, but because that content can now move around the world in an instant. And yes, our societies are far more polarized today than they were in the \u201950s and \u201960s right after the war. And yes, progress will require tradeoffs and hard choices, and we won\u2019t get it right all at once. But that\u2019s how democracy works.\nI\u2019m not going to strain this metaphor, but if you think about the U.S. Constitution as software for running a society, really innovative design. It, too, had some pretty big initial bugs. Slavery \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 you\u2019re discriminating against entire classes of people. Women couldn\u2019t vote. Even white men without property couldn\u2019t vote, couldn\u2019t participate. What part of, \u201cWe, the people?\u201d So, we came up with a bunch of patches, the 13th Amendment, the 14th Amendment, 15th Amendment, 19th Amendment. We continued to perfect our union.\nAnd the good news is we\u2019ve got a new generation of activists that seem to be ready to keep moving. Besides Tiana, who introduced me, I\u2019ve had the privilege of meeting young leaders in our Obama Foundation network, like Timothy Franklyn, who founded the National School of Journalism and Public Discourse in India, to train journalists who are committed to justice and democracy in that country; or Sandor Lederer from Hungary, who founded K-Monitor. That\u2019s a group that helps average citizens understand how public money is spent and flags potential corruption; or Juliana Tafur, who\u2019s using documentary film and curated workshops to reduce polarization and help Americans connect across differences.\nYoung people everywhere are recognizing that this is a problem. They\u2019re not just griping about it, they\u2019re doing their part to fix it. And the rest of us need to follow their lead.\nBut these idealistic, innovative young people, they\u2019re going to need those of us who are already in positions of power, those of us like me who have a platform to get our act together. If Congress is too polarized to pass anything, we probably won\u2019t make the kind of progress we need. If Republican elected officials with a few notable courageous exceptions, and I\u2019m not going to mention them, because I don\u2019t want them to be criticized for having been praised by me \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 but if the vast majority of elected Republican officials keep insisting that there\u2019s nothing wrong with saying an election was stolen without a shred of evidence, when they know better, this isn\u2019t going to work.\nEach of us, whether we work at a tech company or consume social media, whether we are a parent, a legislator, an advertiser on one of these platforms, now\u2019s the time to pick a side. We have a choice right now. Do we allow our democracy to wither or do we make it better? That\u2019s the choice we face, and it is a choice worth embracing.\nIn the early days of the Internet and social media, it was a certain joy in finding new ways to connect, and organize and stay informed. There was so much promise. I know, I was there. And right now, just like politics itself, just like our public lives, social media has a grimness to it. We\u2019re so fatalistic about the steady stream of bile and vitriol that\u2019s on there, but it doesn\u2019t have to be that way. In fact, if we\u2019re going to succeed, it can\u2019t be that way.\nAll of us have an opportunity to do what America has always done at our best, which is to recognize that even when the source code is working, the status quo isn\u2019t, and we can build something better together. This is an opportunity. It\u2019s a chance that we should welcome for governments to take on a big, important problem and prove that democracy and innovation can coexist. It\u2019s a chance for companies to do the right thing. You\u2019ll still make money, but you\u2019ll feel better. (Laughter.)\nIt\u2019s a chance for employees of those companies to push them to do the right thing, because you\u2019ve seen what\u2019s out there and you want to feel better. It\u2019s a chance for journalists and their supporters to figure out how do we adapt old institutions and those core values that made those institutions valuable? How do we adapt that to a new age?\nIt is a chance for all of us to fight for truth, not absolute truth, not a fixed truth, but to fight for what, deep down, we know is more true, is right. It\u2019s a chance for us to do that not just because we\u2019re afraid of what will happen if we don\u2019t, but because we\u2019re hopeful about what can happen if we do.\nOver the last couple of months, we\u2019ve seen what it looks like when a society loses the ability to distinguish truth from fiction. Mike McFaul and I were talking backstage, and my first time in Moscow as president, we gathered with all these civic activists. Putin at that time had receded from the foreground, and you had all these folks who are working to make Russia better. And we were reminiscing and thinking about that moment of possibility and what might have happened to him.\nAnd now, in Russia, those who control the information have led public opinion further and further and further and further away from the facts, until all of a sudden, almost a quarter of the country\u2019s combat power has been damaged or destroyed in what the government is claiming is a, quote, special military operation. That\u2019s what happens when societies lose track of what is true.\nOn the other hand, the last couple of months have also shown what can happen when the world pushes back. We have seen it in the people, including some of our Obama leaders in Europe who are organizing on social media to help Ukrainian refugees, offering food and shelter and jobs and rides. We\u2019ve seen IT in an army of volunteers who work to break through Russia propaganda and reach out to mothers of Russian soldiers, asking them to call on Putin to bring their sons home. And we\u2019ve seen it in the combination of old and new media like a viral image of a Russian TV editor walking into a live shot with a handwritten sign, calling for an end to the war.\nThe handwritten sign was a tool. TV\u2019s a tool. The Internet is a tool. Social media is a tool. At the end of the day, tools don\u2019t control us. We control them, and we can remake them. It\u2019s up to each of us to decide what we value, and then use the tools we\u2019ve been given to advance those values. And I believe we should use every tool at our disposal to secure our greatest gift, a government of, by, for the people for generations to come. And I hope you agree with me, and I look forward to you joining in the work.\nThank you very much, everybody.", "comment_count": 88, "like_count": 3422, "created_time": 1650563632673, "comment": [{"user_id": "9e422a605dc5", "comment_time": 1650563632673, "comment": "Disinformation Is a Threat to Our Democracy"}, {"user_id": "cd1cb0a0c160", "comment_time": 1650702396551, "comment": "The biggest threat to democracy is corporations \"owning politicians\".

In yesterday\u2019s print edition, the paper had yet another humanitarian-only tearjerker, \u201creported\u201d by Carlotta Gall (who should know better!) out of Reyhanli, Turkey. Her piece quoted some of the small numbers of people crossing the nearby crossing into Syria, along with a \u201cmother of three\u201d who was reached by phone in a Syrian village less than four miles from the front line, and \u201cFouad Sayed Issa, the founder of Violet, a Syrian nonprofit relief organization.\u201d\nGiven that Gall almost certainly speaks little or no Arabic, she was presumably reliant on Saad al-Nassife, who was named in a footline, to conduct the phone interview, and maybe all the other interviewing, too.\nGall\u2019s report- like the whole stream of humanitarian tearjerkers the NYT has published about Idlib over the past year- made zero mention of the force that has been controlling Idlib for the past few years, against which the Syrian army and its allies have been fighting. It is an alliance of genocidally takfiri*/jihadi militias led by the Al-Qaeda-affiliated Hay\u2019at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS).\nToday\u2019s Washington Post carried an article that also, like Gall\u2019s focused on the extreme challenges that humanitarian actors have been facing in Idlib. But at least this article, reported by Kareem Fahim out of Gaziantep, Turkey, did mention the political color of the forces \u201cdefending\u201d Idlib from the Syrian government campaign:\nThe government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has vowed to retake all the country\u2019s remaining rebel-held territory and defeat opposition militias in Idlib, including extremist militants linked to al-Qaeda who largely control the province.\nThat mention was a little caveated- the wording lets it seem as though this characterization of the opposition militias is only President Assad\u2019s, and is not necessarily shared by Fahim. It was also brief, and buried deep down in the piece.\nWhy is it important that responsible journalists should mention the fact that the Idlib enclave is under the control of fairly heavily armed Al-Qaeda-affiliated militias? For a number of reasons:\nIf zero mention at all is made of the fact that the enclave is controlled by armed militias, it makes it easier for journalists and those whom they misinform to believe that the Syrian forces and their allies are just gratuitously and cruelly targeting locations and facilities inside the enclave that are very frequently described as \u201chospitals\u201d, \u201cday-care centers\u201d, etc. Of course, to target such facilities makes zero military sense (unless they are co-located with military installations, which they definitely should not be.) Yes, mistakes, excesses, and \u201ccollateral damage\u201d occur in any war; and any war is always horrendous for the residents of the war zone. But if there is zero mention of the presence of any armed formations in the enclave, then the narrative of the Syrian army being gratuitously violent easily takes hold (reinforcing the regime-changers\u2019 longstanding argument that the Syrian government is so uniquely evil that it needs to be toppled asap.)\nIf the fighting is to be brought to an end, which I imagine all people of good conscience would desire, then the politics of war-termination are absolutely crucial. Will there be a negotiated end? I hope so! But if so, what are the political dynamics of that negotiation? To understand that, we would need to have a clear idea of who the relevant forces on the ground are. Yes, there are the armies of Turkey, Syria, and Syria\u2019s allies. But there are also the forces that have been in control of Idlib. And as the well-informed Turkish journalist Fehim Tastekin noted in this recent article, HTS \u201chas come to control 90% of Idlib, displacing factions that Ankara had incorporated into the Astana process. The group will not lose its jihadi character even if it rebrands itself again.\u201d Should HTS be part of any negotiation? And if not, which of the other partioes mentioned needs to deal with it-and how? These are serious questions that those seeking to end the fighting need to understand. Those journos who fail even to mention the presence of this fighting formation in Idlib, let alone the degree of control it exercises over the enclave\u2019s population or its takfiri/jihadi nature, are wilfully misinforming their readers.\nAnd HTS is not just \u201cany\u201d militia. Throughout its existence under various brand-names it has proven itself one of the most actively genocidal and intolerant of the forces in the anti-Assad opposition, with a well-documented record of having slain members of local minority (non-Sunni-Muslim) communities, rights advocates from within the Sunni Muslim community, and Westerners- often in an extremely gruesome way. It has also, just as ISIS earlier did over in northeastern Syria and western Iraq, actively encouraged foreign jihadis from all around the world (and oftentimes also their families) to come to Idlib to join their murderous project. This fact of the genocidal nature of HTS poses sharp legal and moral dilemmas for all aid organizations, as I have written about here and elsewhere. So when Western journos compose all their lengthy screeds about the humanitarian crisis in Idlib (from their at-a-distance reporting locations) without any mention of these dilemmas, which are faced by all legitimate- as opposed to HTS-auxiliary- aid organizations, then they\u2019re doing another specific kind of dis-service to their readers.\nI am planning to write more about these dilemmas very shortly. For the moment, though, as many of us consider the situation in Idlib and how to bring the intense suffering there to an end, maybe we should all be a lot more demanding of pillars of the Western corporate media like the NYT that have been wilfully misinforming/disinforming the public about the situation there and elsewhere in Syria, for many years now.\nJust as a matter of contrast, I note that the NYT has recently carried two strong articles of reporting from troubled zones in the Middle East, written by reporters who took the risks and the time needed to do their reporting from on-the ground. The first was the piece that Alissa Rubin reported from Neptis (near Kirkuk), in Iraq, last week, in which she quoted numerous official Iraqi and local vox-pop sources as casting severe doubt on the Trump administration\u2019s claim that a pro-Iranian militia had carried out the December 27 rocket attack that killed a US military contractor and sparked an extremely fearsome bout of escalation between the United States and Iran. The second came in today\u2019s paper, David Kirkpatrick\u2019s piece reported from inside the portion of eastern Libya controlled by brutal former CIA asset Khaled Hiftar. So it\u2019s not that the NYT doesn\u2019t know how to do real reporting. It is more like, in the case of Syria, they have for a long time deliberately chosen not to.\n* I use the term \u201ctakfiri\u201d to denote the most extreme and genocidal of the many Islamist political trends that are active today. \u201cTakfir\u201d is the Arabic word for, essentially religious excommunication. So a translation for \u201ctakfiri\u201d as a political description might be \u201cexcommunicators\u201d or perhaps \u201cInquisitors\u201d. Some other people just call them \u201cheadchoppers.\u201d\nOriginally published at https://justworldnews.org.", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 1, "created_time": 1582734269836, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Syria", "World", "Us Media", "Syrian Refugees"]}, {"author": "Helena Cobban", "post_id": "98c30ea42cda", "user_id": "7a5466e80e08", "title": "A postcard from the 20th century", "content": "A postcard from the 20th century\n\nWriting and publishing a printed and bound book is like sending a postcard into the future. (Just possibly, releasing digital materials has the same capability, but I\u2019m not sure?) So here, on my desk, is a postcard from the end of the last century in the form of a copy of Sven Lindqvist\u2019s book A History of Bombing, which was first published in Swedish in 1999 CE and released in New York in an English translation by Linda Haverty Rugg in 2001.\nLindqvist was born in 1932. By the time he published AHOB he seemed well aware of the \u201cpostcard-to-the-future\u201d aspect of published books. The short introduction/guide he provided for the book ended with these words: \u201cOnce you have seen my century, build one of your own from other pieces.\u201d\nAHOB is actually \u201cabout\u201d a lot more than just the history of bombing. Maybe the original Swedish version of the title, which was roughly rendered in English as \u201cBang, Bang, You\u2019re Dead!\u201d captures the spirit of the book a bit better. I would describe the volume as one that provides an account of the development of White, male, imperial aggressivity over the course of the 20th century CE that encompasses the histories of air power, rocketry, aerial bombardment, and nuclear weapons, along with the development of all the theories that arose in the \u201cWest\u201d about those notable advances in mega-lethal military technology.\n2.\nHow long is a \u201cgeneration\u201d? In my family, my maternal grandmother was born in 1888 and my first grandchild in 2008. Thus, an average of 30 years per generation. As it happens, it has been almost exactly that span of time since the end of the \u201cold\u201d Cold War between \u201cthe West\u201d and the old Soviet Union. So a whole generation has now grown up in the United States that has no experience of growing up in a Cold War environment, that is, one in which the power of the United States and its allies was kept in check by the counter-power of the Soviet Union and the relationship between those two \u201csides\u201d was characterized by reciprocal threats (generally implicit not explicit, but always well understood) of \u201cmutually assured destruction\u201d and indeed, the destruction of just about all of life on earth as we know it.\nHow can we of the older generation explain some of those realities to today\u2019s under-45s? (And equally, importantly, why did we of the older generation not do a LOT more during the past 30 years to eliminate the well-known bane of nuclear weapons from the whole world while we had a good chance to? But let me bookmark that question to return to it later.) I would submit that reading Lindqvist\u2019s A History of Bombing could be a good place to start our explanation \u2014 along with, perhaps, a viewing of the 2-hour movie The Day After that ABC relased in 1983.\n3.\nOne of the terms used by the whole extensive clan of nuclear-war \u201ctheorists\u201d that emerged during the Cold War was \u201cmassive retaliation\u201d. It was a whole theory of how a nuclear war might be fought, or alternatively, how one might use the grisly powerfulness of nuclear weapons to \u201cdeter\u201d one\u2019s opponent from starting such a war. Let\u2019s find out what A History of Bombing has to say about it.\nSo in most books, to locate material related to one particular term you\u2019d go to the Index. Not in AHOB. Here, you go to the slim list titled \u201cWays Into the Book\u201d that takes up two pages in the space where normally you\u2019d find a Table of Contents. Here\u2019s what this list looks like:\n\n\nReaders may recall that two years ago, I published an appreciation of one of Lindqvist\u2019s earlier works, \u2018Exterminate All the Brutes\u2019, which traced the genocidal nature of \u201cWhite\u201d imperial projects in Africa. I noted that Lindqvist divided the text of Exterminate not into chapters but into numbered sections, each much shorter than a standard book chapter. AHOB is also divided into numbered sections, 398 of them. Each of the first 22 sections serves as a launch-point for one of the thematic narrative threads that weave their way through the rest of the book. The book is otherwise presented chronologically, with a heavy emphasis on the years 1911 through 1999. So let\u2019s dive into his \u201cMassive Retaliation\u201d thread, which starts at Section 18.\n4.\nThis is a very different way to read a book. But intriguing, thought-provoking, and very instructive.\n5.\nIn Section 18, Lindqvist notes that in January 1796 a French researcher called Charles Cuvier gave a lecture in Paris in which he proved that the species created by God were not eternal but could \u201cbecome extinct.\u201d And that, he said, was also true of the human species.\nBut Lindqvist \u2014 who later notes the role that Darwin\u2019s more developed theories of evolution played in justifying all kinds of \u201cWhite\u201d imperial aggression from 1854 on \u2014 does not dwell on Cuvier. At the end of Section 18, he whisks us over to Section 36.\n6.\nIn Sections 36 and 37 he tells us of two literary works, published in 1806 and 1826 respectively, that were inspired by Cuvier\u2019s notion of what we might call \u201chuman extinguishability\u201d. The first of these was a novel by a French author called Cousin de Grainville, titled Le dernier homme (\u201cThe Last Man\u201d). The second was Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley\u2019s 1826 novel of the same (English) title, which foresaw a world in 2090 in which, per Lindqvist, a \u201chappy world is stricken with an epidemic that drives humanity back to violence, barbarism, and superstition. Science and politics are helpless\u2026 Slowly and painfully humankind becomes extinct.\u201d Lindqvist also notes that, \u201cThere is no hint that the plague has been intentionally let loose. No one is trying consciously to \u2018annihilate his race.\u2019\u201d\n7.\nWe\u2019re then sent to Section 61, which describes a 1901 novel by M.P. Shiel titled The Purple Cloud, whose protagonist undertakes an Arctic exploration during which he releases a \u201cpurple cloud\u201d which kills all the rest of humankind. When he returns southward, \u201cHe is the last man. He is all-powerful \u2014 but he has no one to rule. He can commit any crime he wants \u2014 but there is no one to commit crime against\u2026 \u201c He therefore sets to work burning all the world\u2019s cities. (Not clear how he travels between them?) After burning London, Paris, Calcutta, Peking, and other cities he travels to Constantinople to burn it, too. There he finds one young beautiful Turkish woman who has survived: \u201cAn inner voice whispers \u2018Kill, kill \u2014 and wallow!\u2019\u201d\nLindqvist commented: \u201cThis peculiar paean to destruction stands as a portal to a century that would burn more cities and kill more people than any century before.\u201d\n(One added thing I found out about M.P. Shiel was that though he worked mainly in the London literary scene he\u2019d been born in the West Indies where his father may have been the son of an enslaved mother and his mother may have been a \u201cFree\u201d Black.)\n8.\nLindqvist then transports us from the world of literary speculation to the real world of U.S. strategic decisionmaking in the early 1950s. In others of his threads Lindqvist has already explained how the United States had recently carried out massive-scale firebombings of Tokyo, had invested heavily in developing nuclear bombs and various rocketry-based ways of delivering them, and had actually dropped two nukes on large Japanese cities back in 1945. This was definitely a country in which inflicting massive casualties on \u201cthe enemy\u201d, including on non-combatant members of the \u201cenemy\u201d society had become entirely thinkable.\nIn the next stop on this voyage, in Section 277, Lindqvist takes us to the halls of U.S. decisionmaking over Korea, a place where the United States\u2019 possession of a proven nuclear arsenal had notably not deterred the Communist Chinese leaders (who were then allied with the Russian Communists) from sending in a large \u201cvolunteer\u201d force to confront the large U.S.-led military presence on the peninsula.\nSection 277 starts thus:\nProbably no one living in the 1950s intentionally and consciously wanted to destroy the world. But now it had become easier to do it than to avoid it. And perhaps lives could even be saved by threatening to do it.\nWhy did the U.S. allow more than 20,000 young Americans to die in Korea\u2026 even though the U.S. had access to a weapon which, had it been used, would have brought immediate victory?\nThis question was asked more frequently as the war dragged on\u2026\nHe reports on the pressure the Secretary of the Navy and the Chief of Staff of the Air Force brought to bear. The Navy Secretary argued that, \u201cAmericans could not avoid their duty as \u2018aggressors for peace\u2019.\u201d The Air Force Chief stated, \u201cJust say the word, and I will destroy Russia\u2019s five atomic nests in a week. And when I stand before Christ\u2026 I think I could explain to Him that I had saved civilization.\u201d\n9.\nThe Air Force chief, we learn in Section 279, was relieved of his post. But in the presidential election of 1952 the Republican candidate was the former Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) General Dwight D. Eisenhower, who won the election on a tough anti-communist platform. In October 1953, Eisenhower approved a new military strategy, NSC-162/2, that stated that the United States would no longer allow itself to be drawn into lengthy, draining conflicts overseas using \u201cconventional\u201d weapons but instead would \u201cdeter\u201d potential opponents by threatening them with \u201cmassive retaliation\u201d with nuclear weapons.\nLindqvist wrote that this was similar to the way the British had used bomber aircraft to use \u201cair control\u201d to dominate the Middle East between the (world) wars and more recently to try to put down nationalist uprisings, \u201cin Aden, Malaya, Kenya, and so on.\u201d Specifically, the use of bombs in both cases was seen as a way of winning military objectives that was far more cost-effective than sending in large ground armies.\nHowever, there were clear differences between the two types of scenario. First, the British (and the French, and Italians, etc.) all actually used large amounts of air power in their colonial scenarios, whereas under Eisenhower\u2019s strategy the key was to only threaten to use the big weapons. Second, nearly all those colonial uses of air power proved in a fairly short space of time to be politically quite unsuccessful. Within just a few years, the peoples thus targeted had won the political independence that the imperial bombardiers were trying to prevent. (Though they won it only at a horrendously high cost in terms of the suffering the bombers had inflicted.)\nSo how successful was Eisenhower\u2019s strategy of nuclear deterrence through voicing the threat of \u201cmassive retaliation\u201d? Let\u2019s just say it has not been proven unsuccessful at any point until today, though the conflict in Ukraine could turn out to be a tough test for it. (My colleague David Barash recently pointed to a number of cases in which nuclear deterrence did not work, from the perspective that \u2014 as in the case of Korea in the early 1950s \u2014 the possession by one party of a nuclear arsenal did not deter a non-nuclear-armed opponent from confronting it. Another case he cited was that of Argentina invading the Malvinas/Falklands in 1982. Regarding David\u2019s argument I\u2019d note that in cases of a nuclear vs. non-nuclear powers, the \u201cthreat\u201d by the nuclear power of using nuclear weapons against the non-nuclear power would likely not be as credible as would a threat against a known nuclear power. Hence my statement above that massive retaliation has not yet been proven unsuccessful remains, I think, valid in a nuclear vs. nuclear confrontation.)\n10.\nLindqvist notes that in 1954 the popular U.S. writer Philip Wylie published a novel, Tomorrow!, that dealt with the aftermath of an exchange of nuclear weapons that included this dire scenario:\nFinland was not. Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, they were not. Kronstadt melted, Leningrad\u2026 they perished\u2026 Men swallowed, ate, breathed, sickened and perished in a day, a week, two weeks \u2014 men and women and children, all of them, dogs and cats and cattle and sheep, all of them\u2026\nThe last great obstacle to freedom had been removed from the human path.\nI have not read Wylie\u2019s book. At one level, from the way Lindqvist portrays it, it seems like an almost hilarious deployment of the mobilizing concept of \u201cfreedom\u201d.\nI have to note, too, that from the excerpt Lindqvist included there, the book is a little asynchronous with the narrative of Eisenhower\u2019s introduction of the concept of a massive-retaliation-based \u201cnuclear deterrence\u201d.\nOr perhaps not\u2026 What Wylie\u2019s text seemed to be conveying was that the United States could survive the outbreak of a nuclear war, and could thrive thereafter. And maybe the credibility and the plausibility \u2014 for Americans, but probably not for Lithuanians, etc? \u2014 of the concept of nuclear deterrence does depend to a significant extent on the belief that the United States could survive the nuclear war that it threatens to unleash? Worth thinking about.\n11.\nMotoring right along our \u201cmassive retaliation\u201d pathway here in AHOB, in Section 287 Lindqvist notes that in March 1954,the United States detonated the first example of an even more destructive bomb, the first hydrogen (or thermonuclear/fission) bomb, named Bravo:\nIt unexpectedly released fifteen megatons [of TNT equivalent]\u2026 \u2018Bravo\u2019 had the strength of 1,200 Hiroshima bombs.\nTwo weeks later, the air force informed the other branches of service how they intended to use the new weapon. The Soviet Bloc would be attacked with 735 planes armed with nuclear weapons\u2026\nThe overall impression was that \u2018virtually all of Russia would be nothing but a smoking, radiating ruin at the end of two hours,\u2019 reported one participant.\n12.\nBut when Washington\u2019s South Korean ally asked Eisenhower to up the ante against the Russian-supported side in North Korea, the bugaboo of \u201cunthinkability\u201d raised its head. In Sec. 288 Lindqvist cites the Cold War historian John Lewis Gaddis as having unearthed Eisenhower\u2019s response to the South Korean request: \u201cWhen you say that we should deliberately plunge into war, let me tell you that\u2026 war today is unthinkable with the weapons we have at our command.\u201d\nLindqvists\u2019s comment on that was: \u201cSo atomic war was unimaginable. At the same time, threats of atomic war were supposed to replace conventional warfare and render ground troops unnecessary. It didn\u2019t quite mesh.\u201d\n13.\nIn Sec. 290, Lindqvist notes that in April 1955, an air force general gave the joint chiefs of staff the estimate that, \u201cthe combined number of dead for the two opponents in a pair of initial nuclear offensives [would be] seventy-seven million, with sixty million on the Soviet side.\u201d Thus, presumably, 17 million on the American side?\nThis general and his colleagues tried to ask \u201cnine leading American social scientists\u201d to estimate how this degree of losses would affect \u201cthe Soviet will to continue the war.\u201d They could not come up with an answer.\n14.\nLindqvist quotes (Sec. 291) one of the founders of the British anti-nuclear movement as concluding that,\nthe very absurdity of the situation by the spring of 1955 created \u2018a moment for hope\u2019\u2026 The Korean War was over, the French were preparing to leave Vietnam, Stalin was dead. Both the Soviet Union and the U.S. had new leaders. Both had hydrogen bombs and both knew what that meant.\nLarge grassroots anti-nuclear movements grew up in Britain and elsewhere. Leaders in the four nuclear powers \u2014 France, Britain, the United States and the Soviet Union \u2014 all moved towards negotiations for disarmament.\nBut (Sec. 292) they did not move fast enough. In late 1956, France, Britain, and Israel launched the exquisitely planned aggression against Egypt known as the Suez Crisis, and the Russians crushed the (partly US-instigated) uprising in Hungary.\nLindqvist:\nThe international climate grew colder than ever. The Russians began building their answer to the fleet of U.S. intercontinental jet bombers, and four years later, in 1960, the Soviet Union announced its counterpart to \u2018massive reprisal\u2019\u2026\n\u2026 Both superpowers had now based their defense entirely on their ability simultaneously to promise and [to] avoid total destruction.\n15.\nLindqvist\u2019s \u201cMassive Retaliation\u201d thread runs on through 16 additional sections of his book. It takes us briskly through the continued growth of the anti-nuclear popular movements in the United States and other Western countries and through four notable English-language novels, published between 1957 and 1963, that in this new environment of mutually assured destruction explored what the aftermath of a nuclear war might look and feel like. These were:\nNevil Shute\u2019s 1957 novel On the Beach. (For what it\u2019s worth, this one of the first novels from my father\u2019s collection that I took down from the imposing bookshelf in our family dining-room and started to read. It was not 1957. Maybe a few years later, when I was ten or eleven years old? I was riveted by the bleak picture it painted.)\nHelen Clarkson\u2019s The Last Day (1959),\nMordechai Roshwald\u2019s Level 7 (1959), and intriguingly\nAnother book from Philip Wylie, Triumph (1963).\nWylie had evidently not forsaken the fascination with the novelistic possibilities of nuclear war scenarios that he had explored in Tomorrow!, just nine years earlier. But now, his view was a very much grimmer one. Lindqvist tells us (Secs. 316 and 317) that in the 1963 book Wylie, \u201cwrote of what really happens when a hydrogen bomb explodes.\u201d This time, specifically, it is not just Finland and the other Baltic nations that get incinerated, but it happens in the United States as well. He quotes Wylie as writing that,\nas the fireball approaches the earth\u2026 the steel in skyscrapers melts and they collapse. But before they have reached the ground, both the buildings and the ground evaporate, and millions of tons of concrete and bedrock turn into a frothing white light. At the same time the radioactivity streams out at the speed of light in all directions\u2026\nAnd this is just a fraction of the destructive capability of this weapon. There is still the firestorm to be reckoned with, the familiar old firestorm they managed to produce by chance in Hamburg, Dresden, and Tokyo, but which now has become entirely clear\u2026 And finally the radioactive fallout has to be taken into consideration\u2026\n16.\nBut despite this level of destructiveness, Wylie still apparently thinks these weapons serve a worthwhile purpose. Lindqvist characterizes Wylie\u2019s view thus: \u201cWell, says Wylie, the evils of Communism are so profound that the free world never understood them\u2026 That is why the last surviving human beings in Wylie\u2019s tale of the future think that freedom was worth the cost.\u201d\nMore deployment of that wriggling, writhing little concept, \u201cFreedom!\u201d\n17.\nMeantime, while Wylie was writing that text in presumably 1962, Lindqvist reminds us (Sec. 318) that two signal new developments occurred in the real world. Firstly, the Soviets detonated the biggest nuclear weapon ever- a 50-megaton superbomb, equivalent to 4,000 Hiroshimas. Secondly, the Soviets started to station some of their nuclear arsenal in Cuba, just 90 miles off the coast of Florida. Lindqvist provides this succinct description of the impact of that move, that led to the well-known \u201cCuban Missile Crisis\u201d of October 1962:\n\nLindqvist provides a brief glimpse of the bellicosity of the U.S. generals, as recorded by Pres. Kennedy himself during the internal deliberations in the White House.\nThen he notes (Sec. 320) that,\nThere was no \u2018massive reprisal.\u2019 Kennedy was strong enough to hold his trigger-happy generals in check. Krushchev was humble enough to back down.He took his nuclear weapons home from Cuba and contented himself with a secret promise from Kennedy that Americans would bring similar nuclear weapons back from Turkey\u2026\n18.\nAt this point, per the \u201cthreaded\u201d design of Lindqvist\u2019s book, he sends the reader back to Section 19, which is the launchpad for the whole story of \u201cFlexible Retaliation.\u201d Indeed, as Lindqvist notes in his Introduction: \u201cThis book is a labyrinth with twenty-two entrances and no exit.\u201d\nHowever, instead of following instructions my unruly eyes wandered forward to the next section after 320. In it, Lindqvist wrote: \u201cThe Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962 let the air out of the resistance to nuclear weapons. The relief that nothing had happened eased imperceptibly into the illusion that nothing could happen. \u201c Those are my italics. I find that observation very profound.\nHe then immediately added, \u201cTo protest the bombs that were actually being dropped on the Vietnamese seemed more vital than protesting the bombs that threatened \u2014 but up to now did nothing more than threaten \u2014 to exterminate all of humankind.\u201d (To be honest, that feels a little too elided and glib to me. The protests against the Vietnam war did not really become a big thing in the west for several years after 1962.)\n19.\nWhat certainly is worth noting about the Cuban Missile Crisis is that the widespread terror/shock over how close the two superpowers came in 1962 to global nuclear war did jumpstart a number of important threat-reduction processes. These included the initiation of a Washington-Moscow \u201chot-line\u201d so the two leaderships could have speedy communication about developments \u2014 such as a flock of geese flying over a sensitive radar \u2014 that might otherwise have triggered an almost-instant nuclear exchange, and later on, a whole structure of other threat-reduction and arms-control measures designed to ratchet down first the growth of their nuclear arsenals, and later yet, their actual size and the riskiness of their configurations. And along the way, a degree of confidence was built up between the two superpowers that finally, in the years 1989\u201391, allowed the whole, always risky situation of the nuclear-girded \u201cCold War\u201d to brought peacefully to an end without any further use of the devilish weapons.\n20.\nAnd it is that structure of arms-control agreements, confidence-building measures, and even the hot-line itself that over the past 20 years has been substantially (though thank G-d not wholly) torn apart by the successive decisions taken by mainly the U.S. side, but also the Russian side, to pull out of them.\nCould the Ukraine Crisis lead us to another version of the Cuban Missile Crisis, but this time with reaction times and \u201cturnaround times\u201d for decisionmakers being very much shorter than they were in 1962?\n21.\nTwo last points about A History of Bombing. First, in the narrative above I followed only one of the breadcrumb trails that Lindqvist had left through his book. There are 21 others, many of them just as engrossing/informative/shocking as that one. They are listed in the two photos I put in above.\nSecond, did I mention that he provides excellent footnotes? There are 436 of them for his 186-page text.\nOriginally published at https://justworldnews.org.", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 0, "created_time": 1650980234630, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["World History", "Cold War", "Nuclear Weapons", "Cuban Missile Crisis"]}, {"author": "Helena Cobban", "post_id": "a635ac17a824", "user_id": "7a5466e80e08", "title": "Ukraine: 5 articles I\u2019d write if I had the time", "content": "Ukraine: 5 articles I\u2019d write if I had the time\n\nIt is a fact, that I find pretty damned tragic, that I haven\u2019t written anything about the earth-shaking developments in Ukraine, since I wrote this piece on February 24. To be honest, most of that piece still holds up fairly well.\nSo what happened was basically that, energized by the thinking that had gone into that piece and various conversations, including with Bill the spouse and with the colleagues on the board of the non-profit I created back in late 2015, Just World Educational, I decided to have JWE produce a whole big webinar series on the Ukraine Crisis, which I immediately did. Starting March 2 and airing two sessions per week through March 28, my co-host Richard Falk and I hosted eight sessions of that webinar series, featuring a roster of 17 truly wonderful- informed, thoughtful, and inspiring- guests.\nI am still super-glad I did it. It was a lot of work! But I think we made a distinctive contribution to the discourse here in the United States. My great colleague Amelle Zeroug has now put the records of all those webinars onto this fine portal page, and I\u2019m in the midst of a tough push to write digests of all the sessions and compile them into a small print publication.\nDid I mention that this has all been a lot of work? Especially as I am still a little debilitated with the eye problem that struck last November, which often leaves me very tired. Thus, I have not had time to write the various strong commentaries I\u2019ve had in mind throughout the past five weeks, regarding the Ukraine Crisis. Here are digests of five of the pieces I haven\u2019t (yet?) written:\nYou liked the warlordism that followed US-led regime change in Libya? You\u2019ll love the nuclear-armed version that would follow regime change in Russia!\nThis piece would be a commentary on the quite possible/probable aftermath of any successful US/NATO push to oust Russian Pres. Putin, as has been discussed a little in hawkish circles and as would seem to have been implied by Pres. Biden\u2019s March 27 avowal re Putin that \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, he cannot remain in power!\u201d\nAt least in re the anti-Qadhafi push in Libya in 2011, four years later the UK Parliament\u2019s Foreign Affairs Committee did later launch an enquiry into what had gone wrong. People should read its report, which found that the British government \u201cfailed to identify that the threat to civilians was overstated and that the rebels included a significant Islamist element.\u201d\nHelp! We\u2019re being deterred!\nThis piece would address the shock/horror of many US commentators when suddenly- after 30 years in which the U.S. military has roamed the earth, \u201cseeking demons to destroy\u201d and has never been held accountable for any of the mayhem it caused- they discover that when there\u2019s a risk of going mano-a-mano against another member of the UN\u2019s nuclear-armed \u201cP-5\u201d elite, there is also a real risk of escalation to a nuclear exchange and thus to the obliteration of all life on earth.\n\u201cGood God, how can that happen?\u201d is a response of many in the under-45 set who do not remember the mutually assured destruction that lay at the heart of the geopolitical \u201cstability\u201d that marked the old Cold War. These are many of the same people now arguing for a \u201cno-fly zone\u201d over Ukraine. (See Libya, above.) But even without NATO engaging in Libya-style excesses/violations, any attempt to create a non-fly zone over Libya would mean immediate, direct engagement between the militaries of NATO and Russia. (See nuclear war, above.)\nHence, Biden is quite right to rule out any no-fly zone or any other move that would risk a direct NATO-Russia engagement. (Whereas he was perilously wrong/foolhardy to even suggest that regime change in Moscow might be any kind of a goal in the present war.)\nBut also, regarding the \u201cshock\u201d of discovering that we- the great, good United States!- are actually being deterred by the (evil, etc) Russians: this is parallelled to a large extent by the recent realization of some in the Israeli power centers that their military has indeed been actually deterred to a significant extent by Hizbullah\u2019s military, from undertaking bombings and other actions against Lebanon that earlier were almost routine for Israel. A different scale of things, I realize. But still, not trivial.\nOn \u201cpunishing Putin\u201d\nGod, there is so much to write about on this. I would just refer, first of all, to material I used in my 2006 book Amnesty After Atrocity, in which I traced the record of attempts by the victorious \u201cAllies\u201d to punish Germany after, first of all, WW-I and then WW-II. The short version: After WW-I the Allies encircled Germany and sought to get the Kaiser extradited in order to \u201cpunish\u201d him. But the German leaders of that era refused to give him up, so the Allies imposed very tight economic sanctions on all Germans as a form of collective punishment.\nDo we remember how that turned out?\nBy contrast, as WW-II came to an end, things were done differently. The Allies (then also certainly including the Soviet Union) raced in from east and west to obliterate the Nazi regime completely; and each of the USSR and the \u201cWest\u201d established its own successor regime in a part of Germany. This time, the attempt by the Allies to \u201cpunish\u201d those responsible for Nazi-era atrocities was extremely restrained. While the leaders of the USSR and Britain, both of which had suffered extremely harsh losses from the Nazis, were baying for 50,000 or 100,000 top Nazis to be lined up and shot, the US leaders (who by comparison had suffered almost nothing from the fighting in Europe) came in with a plan to have demonstrative \u201cshow\u201d trials of a dozen top Nazi leaders at Nuremberg, while at the grassroots they were busy rehabilitating as many Nazis as they could into the new German state they were building.\nThat turned out a whole lot better than Versailles.\nThis story needs telling and re-telling!\nAs a subsidiary point, I\u2019d just note that (1) the United States has no inherent right to run around the world \u201cpunishing\u201d anyone- especially since it has never even joined the International Criminal Court, and (2) a good case could be made that the entire history of the settler-colonial entity known as the \u201cUnited States\u201d has been based on the pursuit by various elites in this settler-colonial project of successive \u201cpunishment\u201d campaigns against Indigenous peoples, enslaved Africans, etc. It seems to be a very Protestant/Puritan type of behavior.\nTom Lehrer for a new generation\nThis would be a little project to educate the under-45s in the coping mechanisms needed for an era of mutual deterrence. The playlist should definitely include the following Tom Lehrer hits:\nWe\u2019ll all go together when we go\nWerner Von Braun\nThe Wild West is where I wanne be!\nWho\u2019s Next?\nSo long, mom, I\u2019ve gotta drop a bomb, don\u2019t wait up for me!\nAnd more on culture: from Strangelove to Breedlove\nOf course, to learn more about the reality of mutual deterrence, the under-45s should also be watching both \u201cDr Strangelove\u201d and that great 1987 ABC special \u201cThe Day After\u201d.\nBut now, along comes this scary and dangerous character General Philip Breedlove, the former Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, SACEUR, that is, the military head of NATO. Read this 2016 Spiegel report about him. Then see how he\u2019s a frequent \u201cUkraine expert\u201d guest on shows like MSNBC.\n(Not sure if examining Breedlove\u2019s role in the real world is much of a coping mechanism for anyone, though.)\nOriginally published at https://justworldnews.org.", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 0, "created_time": 1649184942286, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Ukraine Crisis", "Tom Lehrer", "Libya", "Punishing Putin", "Nuclear Deterrence"]}, {"author": "Helena Cobban", "post_id": "b2280dc13e92", "user_id": "7a5466e80e08", "title": "Where to now, the \u201cworld order\u201d?", "content": "Where to now, the \u201cworld order\u201d?\n\nBy launching a broad military campaign against Ukraine today, Russia\u2019s President Vladimir Putin has also launched a strong assault against the norms of the sovereignty-based \u201cworld order\u201d that has been in place since 1945 \u2014 or even, one might say, since the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648.\nOf course, the post-1945 order has been majorly contravened by numerous other powers over the past 77 years, most notably in 2003 when the United States used a phony pretext to invade Iraq and \u2014 foreshadowing Putin\u2019s probable goal in Ukraine? \u2014 to topple and replace its leader. Washington and other Western powers have violated international norms many other times since 1945. (Suez crisis, anyone? Bay of Pigs? Overthrow of Allende?) Washington has also for many decades now given full-throated or more covert support to numerous illegal acts undertaken by Israel \u2014 against Lebanon, Syria, Iran, the Palestinians, and others.\nIn Fall 2004, the UN Secretary General Kofi Annan stated clearly that the U.S. invasion of Iraq had been \u201can illegal act that violated the UN Charter.\u201d It also brought untold misery to that country\u2019s 25 million people and their neighbors. But U.S. President George W. Bush was never held accountable for that catastrophic crime of aggression by any bodies, domestic or international. The total impunity he has enjoyed since 2003 has left a deep, lasting scar on the post-1945 order.\nSo now, the Russian military is assaulting Ukraine, reportedly hitting the capital Kyiv, Odessa, and other locations in the eastern two-thirds of the country. Ukraine is not a member of NATO. No active-duty U.S. military forces are located there, so the risk of a direct confrontation between nuclear-armed superpowers is for now small. Pres. Joe Biden is probably right now, as I write this, laying out in detail the nature of the \u201cswift and severe\u201d sanctions that he will now, as previously promised, impose on Russia.\nThe big questions that everyone concerned about global peace and security should be asking now are:\nHow can this assault be ended in a way that minimizes the suffering, does not threaten a re-eruption of violence, and assures a decent working relationship going forward for all the peoples of that region?\nHow can the world\u2019s nations now craft a workable arrangement for governing world affairs that is much more robust than the deeply dented post-1945 order, and that can most effectively help the world\u2019s peoples meet the existential challenges of nuclear war and climate change that our species now faces?\nThe post-1945 order had its strengths, as well as weaknesses. It did provide a framework in which the big post-1945 struggle for power in Europe \u2014 that between the USSR and the United States \u2014 could be regulated, mediated (through a raft of \u201carms control\u201d agreements), and finally dialed down in a peaceful manner. However, that managing of the Cold War between Washington and Moscow was achieved in part at the cost of allowing and inflaming a host of \u201csmaller\u201d wars in the global South that inflicted long-lasting harms on the peoples of Vietnam, Cambodia, Cuba, the Middle East, and many African nations.\nThe post-1945 order officially \u201cencouraged\u201d and in many cases even supported the dismantling of the sprawling global empires run by Britain and France \u2014 and that, though both those powers enjoyed veto power on the U.N. Security Council. But the promise of decolonization often bumped up against the continued ability of the colonial powers to wield economic control over their former colonies, and the issue of accountability or reparations for the preceding centuries of colonial plundering was never even raised.\nBut now, 77 years after the Allied victories in Europe and Asia and the concomitant founding of the United Nations, the post-1945 order is showing its age. The veto system in the Security Council is a relic of the Western imperial era \u2014 more redolent of the 1885 Congress of Berlin that simply sliced the whole of Africa up among the various European powers than of any arrangement built on the principle of human equality.\nMoreover, the fact that the set of nations wielding vetoes rapidly became coterminous with the set of the world\u2019s \u201crecognized\u201d nuclear-weapons powers has had the continuing effect of valorizing the possession of nuclear arsenals.\nIn the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Agreement of 1970, those powers and the treaty\u2019s 185 other signatories all promised \u201cto pursue good-faith negotiations on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race, to nuclear disarmament, and to general and complete disarmament.\u201d During the 1960s and 1970s, the United States and the former USSR did reach a number of agreements that curbed their nuclear arms race, and brought about a degree of nuclear disarmament. But neither they nor any of the other three nuclear-weapons states (Britain, France, China) ever reached agreement on the required complete disarmament of either their nuclear or their \u201cconventional\u201d forces.\nIndeed, the situation regarding global armament/disarmament deteriorated badly in the decades after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union. In 1998, both India and Pakistan conducted very visible nuclear tests, joining Israel as the de-facto owners of nearly launch-ready nuclear arsenals. Then, in 2002, Pres. G. W. Bush unilaterally withdrew the U.S. from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which had been a bedrock of the whole arms control regime throughout the Cold War with Russia; and in 2019, Pres. Trump took the U.S. out of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF), which had been a crucial underpinning of the strategic stability of Europe during the Cold War.\nWe have heard a lot recently about the ill-thought-through decisions taken by Pres. Clinton and his successors to expand NATO ever further east toward Russia\u2019s borders, in the two decades after 1991. We need to understand that Pres. Putin and probably many Russians viewed those steps as very threatening. And they have viewed Washington\u2019s dismantling of many of the pillars of Cold War strategic stability with similar alarm \u2014 as Pres. Putin has underlined in all the declarations he has made since last December. It seems clear that for him the present conflict over Ukraine is not only about Ukraine, but about reaching a strategic situation in the whole of Europe that is less threatening to Russia, and more like a reinstatement of some of the negotiated arrangements that existed during the latter half of the Cold War.\nBut in 2022, the strategic stability \u2014 or should I say, the survival \u2014 of the world is no longer determined only by the armaments/strategic situation in Europe. There are now two other big new players in the international game. One is China; and the other is a form of global soft power that is gathered mostly (though not wholly) around the challenge of the climate crisis.\nToday, China\u2019s capabilities and raw power have a huge impact on the Russia-NATO balance in Europe, making this balance very different from anything the world saw during the pre-1989 Cold War. One example: Bankers and fin-tech experts from China and Russia have been hard at work for some years now, trying to devise a way for their countries and others on the U.S. sanctions list to conduct international trade while bypassing the the US-dominated SWIFT system. If Washington\u2019s upcoming sanctions on Russia are as severe as has been promised, then doubtless those counter-SWIFT efforts will be accelerated; and when a non-SWIFT means of payment emerges, that will bring a much broader swing away from the dollar\u2019s current primacy in global finance.\nIt has been widely noted that China is traversing a complex tightrope on the Ukraine crisis. Pres. Xi Jinping has demonstrated effusive public support for Putin, most notably at the opening of the recent Winter Olympics in Beijing. And he must be delighted to see so much U.S. military attention being turned toward Europe these days, rather than to the South China Sea and its shores.\nBut he and other CCP leaders are also wary of Putin\u2019s support for secessionary entities, whether in Ukraine or, earlier, in Georgia or Moldova. (Who was it who described Xi\u2019s China as \u201cthe best support for the Westphalian system\u201d?) And they may well welcome some slowing of the economic/tech decoupling from the U.S. that Washington has been hellbent on since the Trump era.\nIndeed, it is quite possible that Chinese diplomacy might have a distinctive role to play in limiting and then finally de-escalating all the current (extremely harmful) Sturm und Drang over Ukraine. Let us see.\nAs for the other big new player I mentioned above, a form of global soft power gathered mostly (though not wholly) around the issue of climate change, I am not sure I would classify this yet as another \u201cbig global force\u201d on the order of US/NATO, China, or Russia. But it is clearly a significant emerging force. It is enabled by the myriad new forms of global communications that have emerged since 2000, which can be molded or steered by governments or other coercive entities but never today silenced as completely as was possible during the Cold War.\nThis \u201cglobal soft power\u201d might well become highly mobilized by some of the sequelae of the Ukraine crisis. Gas prices in the west will almost certainly continue to rise; but why are Western economies still so dependent on carbon-emitting fossil fuels, anyway? Major military action, in Ukraine as in Iraq, Afghanistan, or Vietnam, will lead to ecological disasters; and the world\u2019s militaries \u2014 with the U.S. military clearly leading the pack! \u2014 are themselves major emitters of CO2.\nBut above all, in a world in which large military blocs are confronting each other yet again, how can the goals of the global climate-change movement ever be successfully pursued?\nSo yes, in 2022, we are entering a new global era. It is one in which many of the arrogant, unilateralist practices that successive U.S. leaders had lazily fallen into in the decades since 1991 \u2014 simply \u201cbecause they could\u201d \u2014 will need to be curbed, or reversed. There is no way the West can \u201cwin\u201d the current conflict over Ukraine. It can minimize the harm suffered by Ukraine\u2019s people(s); and this will best be accomplished through intensive diplomacy that builds on and reinforces some of the strongest of the principles on which the U.N. was founded. But make no mistake: reform of the U.N. itself and the institution of some very real forms of accountability in the conduct of international affairs should also be on the agenda.\nThe banner image above, by Mark Garten for the UN, is a scene from the session the UN Security Council held late at night yesterday (February 23), on Ukraine.

After all, thought Tricia, I\u2019m miles away from the nearest barn. Not that barn owls only lived in barns of course, but they didn\u2019t usually show up in the city of Pittsburgh. Especially not at noon.\nWhen owls two, three, four, and five, quickly followed after number one, surprise turned to astonishment. These were owls she was seeing right? Tricia wasn\u2019t exactly an ornithologist but the birds were flying low giving her a good view. She pulled out her phone and started snapping photos.\nWhen an entire flock passed by overhead in a V-shaped formation as if they were geese headed south for the winter, astonishment turned to apprehension. Tricia looked down at the Long Island Iced Tea in her hand. Maybe day drinking was a bad idea.\nBarn owls are nocturnal. They don\u2019t flock. They don\u2019t fly in formation. They don\u2019t migrate. Could she have been mistaken? Tricia downed the last of her drink and headed inside to find Tony.\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s definitely a barn owl,\u201d Tony said, handing back her phone. \u201cThey are the most common species of owl and are found almost everywhere in the world.\u201d\n\u201cIncluding Pittsburg?\u201d\n\u201cWell theoretically it\u2019s possible,\u201d Tony said scrolling through barn owl facts on his phone. One of Tony\u2019s most endearing and frustrating characteristics was a tendency to immediately dive into internet research at the slightest provocation and continue to feed you information long after you wanted to move on to another topic.\n\u201cThey aren\u2019t usually found in the city, and they\u2019re uncommon in Pennsylvania but they are very widespread. Did you know they mate for life?\u201d Tony looked up at Tricia with a smile.\n\u201cThat\u2019s nice\u201d Tricia replied, \u201cBut do they ever fly together? Do they migrate?\u201d\n\u201cNo, barn owls don\u2019t migrate. Snowy owls do but only sort of. It\u2019s not like geese or ducks or other birds who head south to the same place \u2014 \u201d\nThanks, Tony,\u201d Tricia interrupted, \u201cBut I\u2019m only really interested in barn owls at the moment.\u201d It was no use, once Tony started down a path you simply had to wait until he exhausted himself before you could get another question in.\nEventually Tony took a breath and Tricia pounced, \u201cBack to barn owls a minute. Would they ever fly together in a large flock in a V formation?\u201d\nTony clicked and scrolled for a few minutes. \u201cNo. They generally hunt and fly on their own. They aren\u2019t territorial but they don\u2019t hang out together outside of nesting pairs or young family groups.\u201d\nTricia frowned. What had she seen?\n\u201cHey,\u201d Tony shouted as Tricia started to head outside again. \u201cThere are a bunch of cool names for a group of owls, even though you rarely find them in a group. They\u2019ve been called a parliament, a congress, a hooting, a diss, a looming, and a stare.\u201d\nTricia turned to stare at Tony, \u201cBut what would you call a V-shaped group of twenty barn owls flying low through the city of Pittsburg at noon in the middle of summer?\u201d\n\u201cImpossible,\u201d said Tony. \u201cI would call it impossible.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Tricia sadly. \u201cMe too.\u201d\nAgrona was deeply engrossed in tiresome internet research when he heard a tapping on the window, sort of a gentle rapping, rapping really. It was a barn owl.\n\u201cNow?\u201d Agrona asked the empty chamber, \u201cSeriously, now?\u201d He yanked open the window so fast the bird tumbled in. Agrona ignored the fallen owl and leaned out the window. Sure enough, the sky was full of owls headed his way. And was that? No, surely they couldn\u2019t be that stupid.\nIt was. The owls were coming from all directions in V-shaped formations. Agrona stepped away from the window and moaned as owl after owl streamed into his upstairs BnB apartment.\nDeep breathes, Agrona, he told himself trying to contain his anger until all the birds were safely crowded inside the room, deep breathes. He started counting owls. 97, 98, 99. He looked out the window. Sure enough, there was one last owl flapping its wings frantically.\nAgrona slammed the window behind the straggling owl so fast he nearly pinned its tail feathers. He leaned on the now-closed window his back to the room full of owls taking a moment to compose himself before turning around.\n\u201cWhat the hell were you thinking?\u201d he shouted as he turned to face the parliament. The owls instinctively tried to take a step back in the face of his wrath but there was nowhere to go in the crowded upstairs efficiency apartment.\n\u201cWhich part of \u2018return as soon as possible but under all circumstances keep a low profile\u2019 was too complicated for you?\u201d\nThe biggest owl timidly stepped forward, \u201cI take full responsibility for any error in judgment, Sir. I issued the directions to return immediately as soon as I received your message. As per standard operating procedure, I directed that all troops camouflage their actions. I recommended we follow the familiar bird pattern of flying in a V formation so humans would assume a natural migration event.\u201d\n\u201cLet me point out where you went wrong, shall I?\u201d Agrona said, ticking items off on his fingers as he spoke. \u201cFirst, owls fly at night not in the middle of the day. Second, owls fly alone not in a group. Third, birds fly south for the winter and it is summer. Fourth, barn owls never migrate.\u201d\nAgrona was out of fingers now so he moved back to his thumb for the final point. \u201cFifth, no human would assume a natural event when seeing owls flying in a V formation because NO OWLS EVER FLY IN A V SHAPE!\u201d\nThe big owl wilted a little bit against the force of Agrona\u2019s tirade but quickly fluffed his feathers and stared directly back into Agrona\u2019s eyes.\n\u201cI take full responsibility for the error, sir, but may I state in my defense, I am currently only possessed of a bird brain, sir. Human lore may consider owls wise but only so much processing power can be crammed into a brain this small. I have done my best with limited assets.\u201d\nAll the indignation drained from Agrona. \u201cYou are right, Hedion, old friend.\u201d He looked around at the crowded room with its flimsy desk containing a Chromebook and stacks of scribbled on paper, a twin-sized bed not long enough for his six foot two frame, bits of tacked up paper notes covering all the wall surfaces, and 100 barn owls pressed tightly together and shuffling awkwardly on the carpeted floor. \u201cHard as it has been for me here, I realize it is even harder for all of you in the field.\u201d\n\u201cI apologize,\u201d Agrona said bowing deeply to the assembled owls. \u201cWe are all on the same team with a challenging mission. Time is running out. Owls were a poor choice as reconnaissance vehicles. We will have to try again with another ubiquitous earth animal whose surveillance behavior will raise no suspicions in the humans. Prepare for immediate consciousness transfer, everyone.\u201d\nDid she dare eat lunch outside today, Tricia wondered. There were only so many summer days in Pittsburg when the temperature hit the sweet spot. Work from home was hard enough so why deny yourself the pleasure of the backyard on a beautiful day.\nShe spread the mayo thickly on her BLT and decided to go for it. She had glanced out of her window several times today without seeing a single owl. She must have imagined things yesterday. She grabbed her plate and a tall glass of regular iced tea. No trips to Long Island today. She wasn\u2019t taking any chances.\nTricia moaned with satisfaction as salty bacon, melted butter, whole-grain toast, ripe tomato, and crispy garden lettuce mingled together in her mouth as she slowly chewed her sandwich. So perky, she thought, I love that.\nShe set her BLT down to take a sip of tea. Was that a rabbit on her lawn? she wondered. Sure enough, it was. And not just one, there were four of them looking directly at her.\nTricia shivered. Normally she would have been delighted by the presence of wildlife in her small city rowhouse backyard but after yesterday she was a bit on edge. The bunnies started hopping towards her increasing her alarm.\n\u201cShoo, shoo, go away bunnies.\u201d She waved her blue napkin at the rabbits without effect. They kept coming, finally settling down almost within touching distance sharing directly at her for disconcertingly long stretches of time before breaking off to nibble some grass as if they had just remembered that\u2019s what bunnies do.\nShe didn\u2019t need to ask Tony about this behavior. Normal wild rabbits would never come this close to a person. What the hell was going on? She grabbed her plate and glass and hurried inside.\nAgrona looked at the bevy of rabbits assembled before him.\n\u201cSorry sir,\u201d Hedion reported. \u201cRabbits are a bust too. We can\u2019t get close enough without freaking them out.\u201d\nAgrona nodded disconsolately. \u201cWe have no choice. It is risky but we will have to move into the animals that are closest to the humans. Communication with each other will be especially difficult as you will all be isolated in individual households. I\u2019m giving you one week to gather all the information you can and then break away and report back here to me. Good luck soldiers. Our entire future is dependent on how well you fulfill this mission.\u201d\n\u201cWell, how did you get here little one?\u201d Tricia said to the shivering ginger dog sitting on her doorstep. \u201cTony,\u201d she called over her shoulder as she held out a hand for the dog to sniff. \u201cTony, come see who came to visit.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s probably hungry poor thing,\u201d said Tony joining Tricia in petting their surprise guest. \u201cI wonder what food is best for a dog. We have some leftover bacon. Do you think that\u2019s okay?\u201d He pulled out his phone and began to search.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure bacon is fine,\u201d said Tricia. The dog had now rolled over for some belly rubs. \u201cIsn\u2019t he just the sweetest thing?\u201d\nTony returned with the bacon. \u201cNow Champ, here\u2019s a little treat. The internet says you can\u2019t have this often but a little nibble won\u2019t hurt.\u201d\n\u201cChamp? You\u2019ve already named him? Does this mean we are going to keep him?\u201d\n\u201cOnly if he doesn\u2019t have an owner looking for him. He doesn\u2019t have a collar but it might have fallen off. We\u2019ll take him to the vet to see if he is microchipped or if anyone has reported him missing.\u201d Tony let the dog lick bacon grease off of his fingers. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t have a home I think we should keep him.\u201d\nHedion had never tasted bacon before. It was a revelation. Way, way above the live mice and voles he had chowed down on as an owl or the grass and dandelions nibbled as a rabbit. This was by far the cushiest job of his long career in military intelligence.\nThe week flew by. Hedion tried to keep his mind on the job but there was so much happiness to distract him. Sure he was hoovering up the important details of daily human life necessary for his species eventual take over of the planet, but he was also gobbling up bully rubs, walks, snuggles on the couch, petting sessions, bowls of kibble, and the occasional slice of bacon slipped to him under the table.\nTricia and Tony were quality people. There was no escaping that simple fact. It was a crying shame their lives would be destroyed by the incoming invasion. Helion tried not to think about it and just live in the moment.\nOne afternoon at the dog park, Helion recognized a fellow soldier.\n\u201cReport, Didian,\u201d he commanded, once he had maneuvered them into a far corner where they couldn\u2019t be overheard. \u201cHow goes your mission?\u201d\n\u201cMy people are the best!\u201d Didian replied. \u201cI\u2019d do anything for them. I keep watch out of the front window. Every day this guy comes around and tries to get in but I bark like crazy so he just slips some papers through the door slot and goes away.\u201d Didian looked at Helion\u2019s stern face. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I check out the papers. It\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the point soldier,\u201d Helion growled. \u201cRemember the mission. You are not standing sentry duty, you are intelligence gathering.\u201d\nDidian yipped in surprise. \u201cOf course, sir, of course.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget we report back in three days.\u201d\n\u201cReport back?\u201d Didian\u2019s eyes drooped and her tail stopped wagging. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how easy that\u2019s going to be. My family keeps a pretty tight leash if you know what I mean. I don\u2019t see how I could get away even if I wanted to.\u201d Didian\u2019s eyes light up and her tail began to wag again. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll be forced to stay.\u201d\n\u201cPrincess,\u201d called one of the humans from the other side of the park. \u201cCome here, Princess. It\u2019s time to go home.\u201d She waved a doggie treat in their direction.\n\u201cPrincess, that\u2019s me,\u201d Didian said, \u201cGotta go.\u201d She tore across the park barking in delight.\n\u201cWow, Champ,\u201d Tricia said as they walked home. \u201cThe dog park really wore you out today. I\u2019ve never known you to move so slowly. It\u2019s like you are lost in thought. What are you thinking about Champ? Your plans for world domination? The doggy take over of the globe?\u201d Tricia laughed and ruffled the fur on the top of his head.\nHelion tried to enjoy his last three days with Tricia and Tony.\nCompartmentalize, old boy, he told himself. Remember what they taught you at the academy. Right now your job is to gather the evidence needed for a smooth overthrow of human civilization so our people can move in and take over the planet.\nYour job is also to act like a dog, loving, protecting, and defending your people. You can do both at the same time. For now. Helion lifted a leg high into the air and licked his genitals carefully as he tried not to think about the looming crisis too deeply.\nIt was time. Helion raced around looking for a way out. He was a soldier. He had sworn an oath to protect and defend. He needed to report back to Agrona no matter how great the loss to himself was, but first, he had to find a way out of this backyard.\nHe would have to dig under the fence. He hunted for the softest soil and began to dig. He moved quickly. It wouldn\u2019t be long before someone noticed what he was up to.\n\u201cChamp!\u201d shouted Tricia. \u201cBad dog!\u201d\nHelion looked up. Tricia was hopping on one foot trying to get her shoes on. He had seconds. He looked at the hole. He could almost squeeze through.\n\u201cChamp!\u201d Tricia called again finishing with one shoe and starting on the other. \u201cBe a good boy and come here.\u201d She lost her balance and toppled over, landing in the doorway with a grunt.\nWas she okay? Helion immediately left his digging to check her out.\n\u201cGood boy,\u201d said Tricia, laughing and petting Champ as he licked every bit of her exposed skin. \u201cWhat a good boy! You came to rescue me.\u201d\nI am a good boy, thought Champ. Such a good boy.\n\u201cAre you seriously trying to tell me not a single agent reported back?\u201d Phraxial leaned forward to glare at Agrona.\nAgrona winced. \u201cYes, sir. I\u2019m afraid that is exactly what I am saying.\u201d\n\u201cYou lost one hundred of our best intelligence agents including my nephew Helion?\u201d\nAgrona nodded. His initial relief at finally being back on the mother ship was rapidly draining away as the enormity of his failure continued to sink in. Phraxial coming to meet him at the airlock hadn\u2019t helped.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been frantically researching dogs since the troops ignored my recall message, Sir. They are extremely loyal animals. Perhaps under the influence of close proximity to the enemy, their loyalties switched. I take full responsibility, Sir.\u201d\nPhraxial\u2019s angry posture slumped in defeat. \u201cWe are out of time. We are out of resources. We are out of agents. There is no choice but to leave Earth. The ancients only know if we will ever be able to rebuild our supplies or find such a perfect planet again.\u201d He turned and walked away from Agrona.\nAgrona stood by the airlock door. His career was in ruins. His people in jeopardy. His best friend lost to a foreign land and form.\n\u201cI should have chosen cats,\u201d he mumbled to himself. \u201cCats never would have assimilated.\u201d\nRead all of my best fiction here.

Either way, you have committed to a birthday party and now you\u2019re trying to figure out how to pull it off without bankrupting or exhausting yourself.\nYou\u2019d also like it to be as environmentally friendly as possible because much as you want your kid to have the magical birthday of their dreams, you also want them, their children, and their children\u2019s children to be celebrating birthdays for decades to come on a healthy planet.\nOh, and it\u2019s not like you have time to turn into a full-time party planner. You\u2019ve got to fit this in amongst all the other sixty bajillion obligations in your life.\nThis isn\u2019t mission impossible. It can be done. You\u2019ll have to modify your expectations a bit and think creatively. But if you are willing to step outside the box you can create a magical day that keeps you, your child, and the birthday guests happy.\nAccording to whatitcost.com a child\u2019s birthday party usually costs $500 to $100,000. Those are crazy numbers. Plan your own party and you can bring the total down to just the cost of food and few craft supplies you probably have lying around anyway.\nI have three children in their 20s so I have oodles of parties under my belt. These included space, Star Wars, Magic School Bus, cats, time travel, mystery, mad scientist, Little House on the Praire, tea party, princess, and farm themed among others.\nHaving creative inexpensive parties is part of a frugal lifestyle that let me create childhood magic while saving enough to send all three kids to college debt-free. I\u2019m not claiming a direct cause and effect here but my point is parties don\u2019t need to take away from your greater financial goals to be fun.\nAsking yourself the following questions is the key to a happy day for everyone:\nTo party or not to party? That is the question\nStart right here. Is a party a good idea or not? Just because everyone else seems to be having a party doesn\u2019t mean you should. First question: will your child enjoy a party? Not all kids like being the center of attention. Maybe your child would much prefer a special dinner with family or a trip to the zoo with one or two special friends.\nSecond question: can you handle a party? I\u2019m going to give you lots of tips for keeping a party fun, manageable, and inexpensive but still, sometimes you don\u2019t have the bandwidth for a party. No judgment here. Parenting is hard and so is life in general. Knowing when to let yourself off the hook is important.\nIdeally, you will provide your child with some magical childhood experiences which make them feel loved. There are many ways to pull this off without big birthday bashes.\nMaybe you don\u2019t want to feel like your or your child is a mooch, always attending everyone else\u2019s parties but never offering an invite. First, most kids and parents aren\u2019t keeping track. Second, who cares about the ones who are? These are not the sort of people worth trying to impress or please because it will never be enough.\nYou can reciprocate generosity and hospitality in other ways. Be the first one to lay down your weapons in the great Birthday party arms race. At least half the parents will applaud you secretly.\nIf you do decide to party, remember you don\u2019t need to do it every year and you don\u2019t need to break the bank.\nWho is this party for?\nIf your answer to this question is not \u201cmy child\u201d you are reading the wrong post. I\u2019m a firm believer the most important person at any party is the birthday child. Seems obvious but often isn\u2019t the way we actually plan and run parties.\nSecond, come the guests. Third, comes you as the host. In last place, and hardly worth a mention, comes the opinion of other parents. Pleasing all four groups is awesome but not worth killing yourself or ruining the day for your child.\nI\u2019m not saying let your child act like a spoiled brat. I\u2019m saying design the day around their personality and interests not what you think will impress other parents.\nSurprise?\nDo not throw a surprise party for a child. I once attended a surprise party for a five-year-old. It was a big blowout BBQ with family, friends, and a bouncy castle. There were probably 30\u201340 people there. I enjoyed it but the poor birthday girl was overwhelmed. It was a lot to throw at her when she thought she was just going to eat cake with mom, dad, and baby sister.\nSurprise parties for an adult who likes social gatherings can be a great idea because many adults will approach a party for themselves with a certain level of anxiety. Who will come, will they enjoy themselves, what do I want to do exactly? Throw this kind of person a surprise party and they will be able to enjoy it more than if they knew about it ahead of time.\nMost kids don\u2019t have that kind of pre-party anxiety. If they do they probably also aren\u2019t the sort of kid who is going to be pleased by any party much less a surprise. If you are honest with yourself you know which sort of kid you have.\nAt least half of the fun of a party for a child is anticipation. They spend weeks thinking about how great it will be to have all their friends over and getting lots of presents. They imagine being the center of attention. Why would you deprive your child of all of this fun?\nWho plans the party?\nYou do with tons of input from your child. Figure out what is most important to your child and what kind of party they want. Consider everything negotiable. Start early and brainstorm possible themes. Let your child throw out wild and impractical ideas then ask questions to narrow it down.\nMany kids will suggest whatever happened at the last party they went to. Help them be creative and think outside the box. Reruns are never as exciting as the first time.\nIf you have an awesome idea within your skillset and budget don\u2019t hesitate to sell it to your child. Make sure you are taking their wishes and personality into account but don\u2019t hesitate to make your life easier as well.\nThree things you need to nail down first\nBefore you can dive into the details of party planning you need to decide on the who, what, and where of the party. These choices strongly influence each other so you\u2019ll be verbally juggling all three balls until the perfect combo falls into place.\nWho?\nHow many people are you inviting? Do you want or need to invite the entire class? Is this the kind of party where parents drop off their kids and leave or do they stay? How many of the people you invite are likely to show up? What ages are you working with?\nWhat?\nAnything can be a theme for a party: jellyfish, dinosaurs, a favorite movie or fictional character, bananas, jello. If your child doesn\u2019t have an idea throw out random suggestions. If you start this process early enough you\u2019ll have fun and entertaining dinner and car conversations for months with more and more bizarre ideas until finally one sticks.\nMy youngest wanted a time travel party for her sixth birthday. What the heck do you do with that? We ended up with a dinosaur hunt, samurai swords, and tie-dyed shirts among other activities. It was a blast.\nWhere?\nYour party location will drive a lot of decisions. Cheap options include your house or a park but you may have other choices you haven\u2019t considered without resorting to pricey, pre-planned party venues. Some community centers, churches, and other civic buildings have inexpensive room rental options.\nDon\u2019t be too quick to rule out your house as a party location. Sure, you\u2019ll have to prepare it but that might not be more work than lugging supplies to another location. You know exactly what you are working with.\nFor my youngest daughter\u2019s fifth birthday she was determined to invite all 25 members of her class and she wanted it at our house. We did not have a big house and her birthday is in the winter. I set up activity centers in almost every room of the house for kids to wander between picking and choosing and it ended up being a great party.\nHow do you keep costs down?\nUse what you\u2019ve got\nStart by considering your assets. What do you already have access to which you could use? A huge collection of legos, teenage family members who can be pressed into service, a large box of dress-up clothes? All these are examples of great material to work with.\nThe less you purchase for the party the better for your pocketbook and the environment. You don\u2019t need to walk into a party store and walk out with themed plates, cups, and party bags. Use plain paper plates or even your own regular plates if you have a dishwasher and the numbers to make it feasible.\nThemed paper and plastic tableware are what everyone else is doing. It doesn\u2019t stand out to kids so you can safely skip this one. Put your money and energy elsewhere.\nCreate your own entertainment\nHiring party entertainers is expensive and can be hit or miss with the kids anyway. Plan a few simple but fun group games, have easy open-ended crafts, and have some play centers set up.\nThink outside the box. For my daughter\u2019s Little House on the Praire party I asked her teenaged cousin who played the violin to be Pa Ingalls. He threw on a flannel shirt and jeans and stopped by for ten minutes to play the fiddle while the kids danced. Perfection.\nWhen you shell out serious money for a performer you\u2019ll be tempted to force the kids to sit and interact even if the performer is bombing with them. Go low-key and it matters less.\nThe more you turn the fun over to the children and the less you try to entertain them the better. For example, instead of hiring a face painter, maybe you provide facepaint (or cheap cosmetics) and let them decorate each other\u2019s faces.\nFill the goodie bags as you go along\nInstead of buying cheap crap to throw into goodie bags, send them home with crafts they made during the party. The bag itself can be craft number one.\nYou always need something easy to entertain children as they start arriving. Have a bag decorating station set up with paper lunch bags, crayons, markers, stamps and stickers or whatever else you have around. Kids can decorate their own goodie bag while waiting for everyone to arrive.\nYou may be surprised how much joy there is in cutting up random bits of paper and gluing and taping things. You can save up junk mail for a few weeks and for some guests this will be the highlight of the party.\nNever underestimate the power of the pi\u00f1ata\nPi\u00f1atas are awesome as a near the end of the party activity. Bashing things and getting candy make most kids very happy. However, there are a few important rules to follow to make pi\u00f1atas fun for everyone.\nYou want a strong pi\u00f1ata. Ideally, it lasts long enough that every kid gets at least one hit. You can buy one or make your own. Here\u2019s a link to the traditional method which is easy and fun but time-consuming. Another easy option is paper grocery bags nestled inside each other. This makes a surprisingly difficult to break pi\u00f1ata.\nIf it is too hard to break you can always give adults a go and if that doesn\u2019t work turn it upside down and shake the contents out.\nOne problem with pi\u00f1atas is they can turn into a survival of the fittest free for all. My twist is I encourage the scramble but I set out a big bowl for candy collection. I tell the kids ahead of time that when the pi\u00f1ata breaks they should run forward and grab candy and then come put it in the bowl before finding some more.\nAfter all the candy is gathered I split it up into the goodie bags. This way everyone gets candy and no child has ever complained about this method or seemed to enjoy it any less. We have an activity and contents for the goodie bags all wrapped into one without any silly plastic trash purchased.\nSimple food with themed names\nYou don\u2019t need to purchase elaborately decorated cakes or other treats. Find simple, easy food the birthday child enjoys eating and rename it or give it a twist.\nFor example, if you are having a Star Wars party, serve pretzel rods and call them lightsabers. If you want to get all fancy you can dip them in colored white chocolate, but even if you skip that step the kids will be excited to eat lightsabers.\nAlso, there is no need to provide an extensive spread. The kids will mostly be too excited to eat much anyway.\nDisaster adverting activities\nMusic is your secret weapon. If something isn\u2019t going well yell \u201cFreeze\u201d at the top of your lungs. Once you have everyone\u2019s attention, announce \u201cDance Party\u201d and start playing some awesome, kid and theme-appropriate music. Dance like a crazy person yourself to get them going. Kids love to see adults acting weird.\nIf your group needs more direction or you really need to stretch this activity out to kill some time yell out different animals for the kids to dance like. Take requests for animal ideas if you start running out. Inanimate objects work too. Dance like a toaster? Why not? Kids enjoy the absurd.\nAnother emergency activity is running in circles. Seriously. Don\u2019t make it a race with clear winners and losers. Much better is a race against yourself. \u201cHow many times can you run to that tree and back?\u201d Praise and encourage every kid.\nOn the other end of the spectrum is the classic who can be quiet and still the longest. Have everyone lie down and be completely still. As wiggly kids fail at this have them join you as judges watching for other kids to move. Or play this game as statues. Kids dance around and freeze into position as soon as the music stops.\nRoll with it\nOnce the party is underway, take things as they come and adjust as necessary. Most kids will create their own fun if you provide them the raw materials of space, place, supplies, and permission.\nHave some independent craft or building projects available for those kids who need a little less stimulation. This can be as simple as a box of legos or a coloring station. Make it okay for quiet kids to dip into and out of group activities at their own speed. Not everyone parties the same way. It\u2019s even okay if this is the birthday child. Doing your own thing or simply watching can be exactly what some kids need and want.\nPlan a few fun activities and then let go of your expectations of how exactly the party will unfold. Are the kids safely having fun? Mission accomplished whether they enjoyed your carefully planned craft project or not.\nInteracting with children and keeping a party going is a skill and some of us are more experienced and gifted at it than others. You know your child. Trust yourself, loosen your expectations and you can do this. If you are really uncomfortable interacting with kids recruit a friend or two to help.\nAbove all remember your parameters for success revolve around the birthday child and their guests, not the parents. Did your child have fun with their friends? If yes, you threw a great party. Well done you.\nRead all of my parenting stories here.

It\u2019s too steep to hike. You need to use the switchbacks to the right. This is only a short way up in comparison to some. Photo by author.\n\u201cWhere\u2019s the coastal path?\u201d a red-faced man gasped demandingly between breaths.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re on it.\u201d\n\u201cNo this isn\u2019t it. Coastal path, on the coast. We\u2019re going to walk to Tintagel.\u201d\n\u201cThis is it. It\u2019s not on the beach, it\u2019s here on the cliff.\u201d\n\u201cWell, are there any more hills like that one?\u201d\n\u201cSix or seven? Don\u2019t know. I lost count.\u201d\n\u201cWell, forget that then. We\u2019re going back.\u201d They turned around and stomped away grumbling. \u201cIt should be called a cliff path, not a coast path.\u201d\n \u2014 Raynor Winn, The Salt Path\nI wasn\u2019t even aware the great Southwest Coastal Path existed until I moved to the southwest of England. We ended up staying in an Airbnb right across from the path.\nEvery morning I\u2019d get up, have my tea, then hike a section of the path. This involved crossing the street to the beach on the other side. I\u2019d kick off my sandals and walk the beach. I\u2019d go left first kicking up sand and collecting interesting rocks until I reached the point where the beach ended and the trail made its way upward through the dunes to the dramatic cliffs above.\n\u201cI don\u2019t have proper shoes for this today,\u201d I\u2019d say to myself and turn around to walk to the other end of the beach where I\u2019d reach a similar path rising sharply up to a cliffside walk.\nOne day I wore proper shoes. I kept going up the trail at the end of the beach. After hiking uphill for twenty minutes the trail leveled out for a bit and I found a nice pub. I ordered a pint of local cider and sipped it watching the waves.\nThis is not the way Raynor and Moth Winn hiked the Southwest Coastal Path. Raynor wrote about their insane journey in the bestseller The Salt Path. They did the 630 miles sleeping on the path, no money for pub meals, stealing candy and showers at a campground when funds were running low. They walked it all.\nThe Winns ended up on the path because they didn\u2019t know what else to do. They\u2019d lost their house and with it their small rental livelihood. Moth received a terminal diagnosis. Everything was upended so they walked.\nI have walked many of the same miles the Winns walk in chapters 1\u201310. As I read I\u2019m constantly struck by how different my journey is and yet echoes of the relentless challenge and healing nature of the paths crash in from time to time. We are different and we are the same.\nI arrived in England battered and bruised metaphorically by the stress of several difficult years in a row. Each morning my spouse headed to his new job, while I walked the beach and contemplated what I would do with the rest of my life.\nSpoiler alert: It seems Raynor and I came to the same conclusion after our vastly different walks over some of the same territory. We write.\nOur Airbnb was filled with local guidebooks, pamphlets, and other touristy information. Which was how I discovered the Southwest Coastal Path existed. I told my spouse all about it when he came home from a day of work.\n\u201cI think we should try to walk the entire Cornwall stretch of the path over the three years we live here. Obviously not all in one go. But we can do a section at a time. We\u2019ll drive to a section, walk as far as we can/want to then drive back to pick up where we left off next time.\u201d\n\u201cYou realize that will mean walking the path twice, since we will be covering the same ground going to and from wherever we park the car,\u201d my mathematician spouse pointed out.\n\u201cTrue, but who cares. We only have to please ourselves.\u201d\nOnly pleasing ourselves was a sharp contrast to the last few years when our actions had been almost completely outwardly focused.\n\u201cI\u2019m in,\u201d he replied. \u201cSounds like a great idea.\u201d\nWhen Raynor and Moth hit the path, they were surprised by the extreme elevation changes. Most of us, when we hear coastal path think of pleasant strolls along the beach or maybe delightful dallying along clifftops looking down at the waves. We don\u2019t consider a cliffside path constantly going up and down with the contours of the cliffs and descending and ascending sharply all the way down to the beach every few miles.\nStunningly beautiful? Yes, absolutely. A stroll in the park? No. Still the coastal path is accessible to almost all ability levels if you choose your stretch wisely. Walk any bit of it and you might pass hikers kitted out in full gear with poles and sturdy boots as well as holidaymakers in flip flops and bathing suits.\nNear my home, there is a free car park where the path comes all way to the pavement. There is a level stretch heading out to a point or you can just sit in the car enjoying the waves crashing on the beach below or taking in a gorgeous sunset. Those with limited mobility can take on a bit of the path even if they don\u2019t leave their car.\nMy first venture off the beach portion of the path convinced me my goal of covering the entire Cornwall section over time might be overly ambitious. We live near some of the most challenging stretches of the path. Still, in two and a half years we have done a large chunk of the north stretch and small bits of the south.\nHere is what hiking the trail looks like for the Winns. Walk the entire path, camping illegally wherever near the path is flat enough for a tent. Eat almost nothing except candy because that is what they can both afford and find without going too far off path.\nAnd for us? We head out on a fine weekend day with our mini backpack full of water bottles, nuts, and fruit. We drive to a parking spot, usually a beach then pick a direction. We hike up a steep incline from the beach to the cliffside then walk up and down the contours of the cliff path until we are starting to get worn out or we reach one big descent too far.\nRather than the walk being a time to get our thoughts straight and make a plan, it had become a meditation, a mental void filled only with salt wind, dust and light. Each step had its own resonance, its moment of power or failure. That step, and the next and the next and the next was the reason and the future. Each combe climbed out of was a victory, each day survived a reason to live through the next. Each lungful of salt scouring our memories, smoothing their edges, wearing them down. \u2014 Raynor Winn, The Salt Path\nSometimes you need a bit of mental void in your life. Sometimes you need to put one foot in front of the other without trying to think of anything but the path. Sometimes you need the wind and waves to erode the problems of the past and the fears of the future so you can just be in the present.\nThe ocean calms and centers me. Walking alongside it is always a blessing no matter what pain or joy I hold inside when I arrive. Dipping into and out of the path has been restorative for me and I hope to hike many more miles before we need to move on to the next location and the next challenge in our path.\nA handful of us are reading The Salt Path and reflecting here on how the Winn\u2019s journey shines a light on our own paths past, present, and future.\nI\u2019m collecting all our stories in the following list.\nWriters Reflect on The Salt Path\n marydj03.medium.com\nTagging those taking The Salt Path Journey: Scot Butwell, Evon, Janice Macdonald, Klara Jane Holloway, C.A.

Make me an offer.\nLast week I was in rural Arizona, and in the course of business I met two of the older guys in town. One of them owns and operates the motel, which most likely exists because if you drive a truck from the Port of Los Angeles for a regulation-limit 11 hour day, right around here is where you end up. The other one built the RV park, and per his business card, he is also a real estate agent, dealer of premanufactured homes, general contractor, and notary public. Both of them spotted that I was here with a bunch of California tech money. (The tip-off was that I was driving what they called a \u201cnew Toyota\u201d around the desert. It is a 2007 FJ Cruiser with the paint peeling off.) Both of them asked what I knew about bitcoin and NFTs.\nIf this isn\u2019t the \u201cshoeshine boy\u201d moment for the grab bag of internet schemes called \u201ccrypto,\u201d then it\u2019s close. So I\u2019m writing this thing. It is meant for people that are tech-adjacent, not engineers or mathematicians, that are starting to get FOMO at mainstream news telling stories of overnight millionaires. It\u2019s motivated by my general annoyance at crypto hype that is incredibly stupid, and simultaneously, much criticism that is equally stupid.\nOnce more, though there are already many Explainers, this one is mine.\nFirst of all, here is what bitcoin is: a big ledger, as in a list of transactions, copies of which are kept on random computers around the internet. Anyone can download and read it, and anyone can participate in the convoluted process that updates it. Functionally, it is the same as an append-only Google spreadsheet that everyone can see. The difference is that a Google spreadsheet is controlled by one company (Google), whereas the bitcoin ledger is just kind of\u2026out there, on a \u201cdecentralized\u201d network, in much the same way a file on BitTorrent or Napster used to be. The bitcoin designers used some math tricks that came from cryptography, and a \u201cproof of work\u201d idea that was invented in 1992 and scoffed at because it was \u201cinefficient\u201d (ha ha ha sob), to devise a scheme that forces everyone\u2019s copy of the ledger to stay in sync. None of the details of how this works matter.\nWhat the bitcoin people actually wanted was to invent a new kind of money. The ledger idea is how they did it. If you go out today and \u201cbuy bitcoin,\u201d what happens is that somebody takes your money and writes a line to the ledger that says \u201cI, John Q. Buttcoin, have transferred 3 bitcoins to Marvin J. Mooney.\u201d Later, if you want to give your 3 bitcoins to someone else, such as to buy a burrito, you write a line to the ledger that says \u201cI, Marvin J. Mooney, have transferred 3 bitcoins to Buttcoin Burrito Bros.\u201d\nSince anyone can read the entire ledger, anyone can figure out how many bitcoin are currently owned by you, and Buttcoin Burrito Bros, and everyone else. That\u2019s the scheme.\nFor at least a decade, the only people paying attention to bitcoin were extremist libertarian computer geeks \u2014 people that have always been good for the occasional wild-eyed rant at lunch about how \u201cfiat money\u201d isn\u2019t real, and who spend all their disposable income buying gold krugerrands and burying them in the yard. (Neither this nor the burrito is a made-up example; these are people I knew at Google.)\nThis group was hoping to float a whole new bitcoin economy. Your extremely online tech job would pay you in bitcoin, you would pay your bills in bitcoin, use it at the store, etc. That was the \u201cbitcoin as currency\u201d dream.\nThis, obviously, never happened. It\u2019s hardly worth the trouble to run through all the reasons why, because no one is seriously trying to sell the idea anymore, but you can know with confidence that \u201cbitcoin as currency\u201d will never happen. There are technical reasons, because the protocol is inherently unscalable. There are social reasons, large among them the fact that there\u2019s just no motivation for the whole project. We already have a made-up currency called the U.S. Dollar, and an entire financial system based on electronic records, and the status quo works better than bitcoin for everyone except ransomware gangs.\nSo it goes. With bitcoin-currency a dead end, the technology became a solution wandering around in search of a problem.\nFirst, people renamed the \u201cappend-only ledger\u201d idea into \u201cblockchain\u201d and started trying to sell it to corporations and governments. You could imagine such a scheme being used to maintain something that we all have to agree on, like records of land ownership. But not anywhere in the United States, where there is already very much a centralized authority called a county recorder\u2019s office. Governments who want to do something Innovative have asked me, totally seriously, about a vendor\u2019s \u201cblockchain\u201d pitch at least a dozen times. I have never heard of an application where it makes sense, and struggle to imagine one. And the search for the problem that bitcoin can solve continues.\nThat brings us to NFTs.\nTo invent the \u201cNFT\u201d (\u201cnon fungible token\u201d), you just have to go one more step past bitcoin. People made another blockchain that works more or less the same, but is more complicated, and lets you store more types of ledger entries. It\u2019s called Ethereum. The Ethereum blockchain accepts ledger transactions in various formats, one of which is for unique \u201cassets.\u201d Here is what [the metadata for] one actually looks like:\n{\n \u201cname\u201d: \u201cBuzz\u201d,\n \u201cdescription\u201d: \u201cPaper collage, using salvaged and original watercolour papers\u201d, \n \u201cimage\u201d: \u201chttps://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmWc6YHE815F8kExchG9kd2uSsv7ZF1iQNn23bt5iKC6K3/image\",\n \u201cmeta\u201d: \u201chttps://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmWc6YHE815F8kExchG9kd2uSsv7ZF1iQNn23bt5iKC6K3/other\"\n}\nA block like that gets defined, and assigned a unique ID number, and now, the \u201cownership\u201d of that block can be reassigned by future ledger transactions, same as a bitcoin. That\u2019s an NFT.\nNow things start to get really stupid. Mainstream press began to talk about people \u201cbuying\u201d digital art, and tweets, and any other random stuff. The only concept of \u201cdigital ownership\u201d that has any meaning in real life is copyright, and amazingly, NFTs don\u2019t even address this. All they do is put your name in a ledger as the \u201cowner\u201d of a block of text that contains a URL. There\u2019s not even a mechanism to guarantee that a file exists at that URL, let alone that it contains something you care about.\nThe image at this NFT\u2019s target URL\nIt is already a common experience to buy an NFT and later find that its URL points to nothing, a 404. To an engineer, nothing has changed: You still have the key proving \u201cownership\u201d of the certificate with the URL. (That\u2019s why it\u2019s difficult to even \u201cdebunk\u201d this \u2014 there was no bunk to begin with!) To an ordinary person who thought they \u201cbought\u201d a cartoon picture, or a journalist who has little understanding of technology, it looks like they got robbed.\nIf the file does exist, you have no defined legal rights to it. The copyright owner can still refuse any use you might have had for it, if they choose.\nIt makes no sense to describe what\u2019s happened here as \u201cbuying an image\u201d or any such thing. As many have pointed out, it\u2019s much closer to those companies that you can pay to \u201cregister\u201d a name for a star.\nNFTs are so vacuous that much of the common criticism is also dumb. There are scandals about \u201ccounterfeit\u201d and \u201cfake\u201d NFTs, but the word doesn\u2019t even mean anything. So someone wrote down a URL in a blockchain that, at one time, pointed to an image you created? What are you going to sue them for? Saving a URL? The exchange that shut down over this is putting on a show of pretending to care about the marks\u2019 concerns, because it\u2019s not time for the big blow-off yet. There\u2019s gotta be some colorful con-artist slang for it.\nThen there\u2019s the cackling internet rabble that boasts they are \u201cstealing\u201d your NFTs by \u201cright-clicking.\u201d OK, you saved a copy of a picture that was publicly posted on the internet. So what? Was somebody hoarding procedurally-generated ape cartoons for only their own eyes to enjoy? Does that person have brain damage?\nBy saving a copy, you created zero rights to use or redistribute that file, which is the same number of rights the NFT owner had. \u201cStealing\u201d an NFT image is stealing nothing because there was nothing there to steal.\nTo get back to familiar territory: What we are left with, then, when I own a bitcoin or an NFT, is an \u201casset\u201d with no intrinsic value. I can\u2019t eat it like a hamburger, sit on it like a piece of land, or pay my taxes with it like a dollar. If I owned an actual piece of art, I could at least put it in my house and not let you look at it, which is clearly a kind of value with appeal to rich people, but with an NFT I can\u2019t do that, either. The only thing I can do with it is sell it.\nThere\u2019s nothing novel about a valueless asset being traded for money. They\u2019re called \u201cgreater fool\u201d assets, which, unless this is the first Bitcoin Explainer you have ever read, you already know. Remember the tulip bulbs in Amsterdam? In my lifetime there have been several examples: baseball cards, pogs, Beanie Babies. Each of these things has more intrinsic value than a bitcoin \u2014 I am sure that somewhere, there is a person with a room full of Beanie Babies that takes great joy in looking at them. Each of them was also a fad, and anyone that bought one for thousands of dollars and held onto it ended up with nothing. The greatest fool.\nNevertheless, trading greater-fool assets doesn\u2019t have to be stupid. You can certainly make money. The subprime lenders did, until 2008. So did the banks that \u201csecuritized\u201d those mortgages, blatantly passing the risk on to some greater fools. Most of the money I have came from a greater-fool asset called Google stock. (I don\u2019t know why this isn\u2019t talked about more \u2014 a share that pays no dividends, and confers no voting rights, is a share of exactly nothing. Most tech stocks fit this bill.)\nTwo weeks ago, I saw a friend wake up at 6 a.m. to mint an NFT, which she soon sold for Ether tokens notionally worth $30,000. If she can get that money out \u2014 which is a whole other can of worms \u2014 it will pay for a renovation of her real-life house. That guy who bought the 3-bitcoin burrito had many other bitcoins, luckily, and he seems to have bought a monastery in New England and disappeared. These are things that happened.\nThis is why the bitcoin haters and debunkers have started to sound as crazy as the crypto bros, making equally unsound arguments. Crypto assets might well crash back to zero, but it\u2019s not any more inevitable than with any other greater-fool asset, of which there are many. Perhaps you\u2019ve heard, \u201cthe market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.\u201d\nNet of all that, here are a few things I think a crypto-curious person should think about:\nYou must truly understand that these are valueless, greater-fool assets. Their \u201cfundamental\u201d valuation is zero. Trading them is gambling.\nAre you sure gambling is what you want? Prove it. Go to the nearest casino, which I\u2019m pretty sure can be done over lunch anywhere in the U.S., take a thousand dollars (or any amount similar to a bet you would make on the NFTs you\u2019re looking at) and put it on the roulette table. If you lose and hate it, or if that sounds like something you would never do, then you\u2019re going to hate crypto gambling, too.\nDon\u2019t believe anything you read in the press. Those \u201chundreds of thousands of dollars for a tweet\u201d stories are almost all fake. Crypto shills are selling these items to themselves for massive price tags to manufacture those stories. This is called a \u201cwash sale,\u201d and it\u2019s also done, illegally, to manipulate stock prices. Even stupider are stories with eye-popping numbers for \u201ctransaction volume\u201d or \u201cmarket cap\u201d for crypto assets. These are manipulated so easily that they are meaningless concepts in this world.\nWith anything else you read, look for conflicts of interest. Nearly everyone hyping crypto has already bought in, and they can\u2019t get their money back out unless more people come along and buy in. Or else they aim to make money on the gold rush itself, in the picks-and-shovels way. That\u2019s what\u2019s up with all the TV ads.\nConsider whether you might as well gamble with penny stocks (aka pink sheets, aka OTC issues). Your brokerage account probably has them, the transaction costs will be orders of magnitude lower (increasing your win probability), and you eliminate the chance of getting ripped off by any of the dozens of scams rampant in crypto wildcat banking.\nThe number of people and dollars participating in the crypto market is much smaller than it appears. About 97% of bitcoin transactions are transfers between exchanges, or \u201ctumblers,\u201d which are pointless shuffles among wallets meant to make money untraceable. About 67% of NFTs never have a \u201csecondary sale\u201d after they are created. (This data is old, and it would be interesting to see an update.)\nAre you an artist being pitched NFTs? If your would-be crypto partner is putting up all the fees for opening accounts, funding wallets, and minting costs, then go for it! I can\u2019t see why not; you have literally nothing to lose. As presently implemented, you are transferring none of the rights to your work by selling an NFT. You can sell the same one again tomorrow, or sell the original work in any other forum you might have. On the other hand, if your would-be crypto partner is proposing that you pay all the up-front costs, then be aware that few artists ever make that money back. It\u2019s no different from the vanity-gallery type of scam that you already know.\nSo, at last, that\u2019s my advice for Arthur and Danny in Arizona, and everyone else in my Facebook feed that is accustomed to working for money and wondering if they\u2019re a sucker for it. There\u2019s no reason or justice in our high-finance casino economy, so that\u2019s not what this post is about. Crypto just isn\u2019t a high-expected-value bet.\nMost people gambling on crypto are going to lose money. Not all of them. With a boring old index fund, most people are going to win. Not all of them. I\u2019m not touching crypto stuff myself, not even to short it, since that\u2019s just another gamble. If you know all this and want to play, then have at.

So is poor data security", "content": "Foreign interference is old news. So is poor data security.\n\nThe FBI and DNI called a news conference Wednesday, but unfortunately, they forgot to bring the news. Instead, they told us that foreign countries have obtained voter data for the purpose of interfering with our election.\nOn the topic of foreign interference, the willingness and ability of hostile nations to attack our electoral process is no secret. The US Intelligence Community Assessment attributing the infamous 2016 hacks of the Clinton campaign and DNC was declassified and published while I was still in the Obama administration, which feels like 3,000 years ago. Dozens of outlets before and after the election reported that Russia also attacked state and local governments, making off with assorted bundles of sensitive, non-public information (such as Illinois drivers\u2019 licenses), and modifying voter registration data. Eventually, the Senate Intelligence Committee grudgingly admitted that the Russian effort targeted all 50 states, a systematic attack nothing like the isolated incidents that the US government first tried to portray. If anyone has just found out this week that Russia and Iran are actively attacking the 2020 election, well, they are really going to be upset when they hear about this new virus.\nRegardless of foreign actors, it\u2019s worth thinking about the tradeoff between privacy and transparency that is baked into the election process. Maintaining confidence in the process requires access and accountability, and there is a lot of election data that is, rightfully and by law, in the public domain and useful for many legitimate causes. When it\u2019s obtained through the public process, and exploited by bad actors, there\u2019s not much we in the industry can do. But we can and must protect our own data and derivative products, which are far easier to use. (We would know; we just spent two years compiling and cleaning those public records.) It\u2019s important to us that no one on the Democratic side repeat the sorry episode from 2017, when a trove of personal data on 198 million voters was carelessly left exposed by a Republican data vendor.\nTo that end, Alloy rigorously applies industry best practices to control and audit access to our production systems, and protect our data in transit and at rest. We expect the same care from our customers, and those building applications that use Alloy data. In that spirit, we thought we would share a few specific recommendations that we have found to be the most important:\nA password manager is a must. It turns out that it does not, actually, require a 197 IQ to guess that your twitter password is \u2018maga2020!\u2019.\nA physical \u201csecurity key\u201d token (sometimes called FIDO, U2F, webauthn, or Yubikey) is necessary for high-leverage access points, such as your Facebook ad account or AWS root account. Usability on these has improved since 2016 \u2014 they even work on iOS now. When we heard many state parties couldn\u2019t afford Yubikeys last year, we brought them to one of their annual gatherings, because in this ecosystem, we all have to support each other.\nWe use ChromeOS (Pixelbooks) for all of our employees. Yes, the engineers use them. Yes, the designers use them. No, they don\u2019t love it. You give up some power and access to familiar tools. We made this tradeoff to gain the significant improvement in safety against malware and browser threats.\nOur CISO, Alex Gaynor, co-created an open source component that enables you to use a TOTP key (aka \u201cAuthenticator app\u201d) to obtain short-lived certificates for SSH logins.

The answers are hiding in plain sight.", "content": "How do we stop another Iowa tech nightmare? The answers are hiding in plain sight.\n\nFrom the moment I saw the first headline blaming the Iowa caucus reporting delay on a smartphone app, I knew what was coming: garbled, contradictory bug reports from the field. Social media jammed with toxic false rumors and deliberate spin bordering on disinformation. News stories sourced from anonymous quotes that are more about score settling than anything that happened in Iowa. And by the next day, a mailbox full of questions from journalists with a familiar refrain: from healthcare.gov to the latest debacle, why does this keep happening?\nThere are answers. In fact, they are well known in some circles. Most importantly, the government and political arenas share two harmful cultural attitudes that contribute to repeated, avoidable failures.\nThe greatest cultural problem was on display this week. When things start to go wrong, everyone from the Twittersphere to reporters scramble to find and blame a single cause: one mistake; one vendor; one individual. This is both tactically useless in the moment and strategically self-destructive in the long run.\nIn reality, when a system as complicated as the Iowa caucus breaks down, it is the product of multiple minor failures, incidents, and unexpected behaviors. Fixing it is like assembling a jigsaw puzzle where 300 people each hold one piece. It is impossible to address when everyone knows that whoever is found holding the \u201cworst\u201d piece is going to become a scapegoat for the entire picture. This is why, in government and politics, big failures are almost never followed by big fixes.\nPoor failure management has long-term corrosive effects as well. Simple survivor bias means that leaders at too many of our most important institutions are people that, having experienced failure, have learned only one lesson, which is to dodge accountability. After Iowa, as in past incidents, the individuals who just learned much more meaningful (and expensive) lessons about how to build reliable technology will leave and take their knowledge with them.\nOther, more successful industries hold \u201cblameless problem resolution\u201d as a core value. Aviation did not get safe enough for commercial air travel until regulators and the industry learned to stop writing down \u201cpilot error\u201d as the root cause of every crash. Thomas Watson, former chairman of IBM, once famously said: \u201cI was asked if I was going to fire an employee who made a mistake that cost the company $600,000. No, I replied, I just spent $600,000 training him.\u201d\nA second problem endemic to government and politics is that our large institutions do not understand that their core missions now depend on \u201cnew\u201d technology. If you spend time with the leaders of old, large institutions, you will discover that many of them think of the tech industry in 1980s stereotypes, of nerds that live in the basement and can be paid in pizza and Mountain Dew. Worse, thanks to the overwrought hero stories of 2008 and 2012, progressive politics has an entrenched belief that all we will ever need, tech-wise, is a couple of plucky volunteers to work miracles from their garage for a few weeks. Convenient stereotypes feed leaders\u2019 natural fear of change and desire to maintain control, and the result is that critical decisions about schedule, scope, and budget for large tech projects are often made with no input from technical experts.\nThere is a third factor that is particularly relevant in politics on the Democratic side, which stems from a belief that good technology comes from lone prodigies. Unlike the Republicans, the Democratic establishment has no sustainable, built-to-last technical infrastructure that receives reliable support from donors or party leaders. Instead, we put misplaced faith in \u201cthe market\u201d solving our infrastructure needs, in the form of myriad shoestring operations competing for tiny venture-capital-style \u201cseed grants\u201d and contracts from PACs and campaigns. The money that flows to tech firms is a tiny fraction of political spending, and it dries to nothing in the off-season. The Clinton campaign hired a team of dozens to curate data and build technology. Nearly all of them have left politics, taking their knowledge and expertise with them. The same was true for most of the entrepreneurs who, motivated by Trump\u2019s election, stepped into the ring in 2017.\nThe real priority is in plain sight. Multiple organizations have announced plans to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on ad campaigns to fight Trump in 2020. Contrast that with the $60,000 budget and two-month timeline for an app to execute what may be the most critical primary of the season.\nEventually, the media will likely conclude that the Iowa situation was a \u201cperfect storm\u201d of uniquely incompetent people and unforeseeable, one-off anomalies. The truth is that these storms are a product of the climate we have constructed for ourselves.

Let\u2019s fix this mess.\n\nToday The New Data Project launches a new version of VoteWithMe, our free, easy-to-use mobile app that lets you amplify your impact in the November election by finding and encouraging your like-minded friends to vote. It\u2019s up and running and available now in the Apple and Android app stores.\nHow it works: First we help you check your own registration status and vote history, because voting yourself is the first most important thing to do. Then, with your permission, we look up the voter data for the people you know, using your contact list. When we find someone, we show you relevant information about their local elections, their registration status, and whether they have voted in past elections. We\u2019ll suggest text messages that might be appropriate to send to them. But we never put words in your mouth or send messages without asking. You push the button yourself.\nWe know, asking your friends to do things is awkward. That\u2019s why it is so much more powerful than talking to strangers. We\u2019ve done the science and found that messages from friends are about twenty times more effective at encouraging voter turnout than other common methods.\n\u201cThis is the greatest piece of technology since the horseless carriage,\u201d \u2014 not a real user quote, but I\u2019m pretty sure she was thinking it.\nYou may have seen similar apps before, but you haven\u2019t seen this one. We don\u2019t force you to register with us or with any other group. We don\u2019t put you on an email list, because we don\u2019t have one. The app contains no ads, and we never ask you to donate money. You have to grant us permission to access your contact list, because looking up your contacts in the voter file is what the app does. And that\u2019s the only thing it does. We do not permanently save your contacts, and they are not being sold to or shared with anyone.\nWhy are we doing this differently? When I worked on the 2008 and 2012 campaigns to elect President Obama, data and technology were a critical part of how we won. In those innocent times, advertising to Prius owners on Facebook was edgy and innovative. Since then, Facebook and Cambridge Analytica have pushed the boundaries and forced us to wonder where tailored marketing crosses over to unethical manipulation. You probably have mixed feelings about the data reach and mass surveillance used by political campaigns. So do we.\nVoteWithMe is powered by public records that most people don\u2019t realize are public. Campaigns have used these records for decades, and sometimes have taken steps to prevent you from realizing it. We feel that as long as this data exists, regular people not on a political payroll should be able to see and use it, too. VoteWithMe packages up a campaign back office and puts it in your hand, minus the empty pizza boxes and whiskey bottles. Trust me, VoteWithMe smells better.\nTesting in Pennsylvania in March 2018.\nWe don\u2019t think anyone has done this before. We hope you like using VoteWithMe as much as our hundreds of UX interviews suggest you will. And if so, please, spread the word to your friends.\nBenjamin Franklin famously said to the people gathered on the steps outside Independence Hall that the new government was \u201ca Republic, if you can keep it.\u201d We can keep it a little longer, only if enough of us bother to vote. VoteWithMe can help.\n\n\nIn the current climate, causes and campaigns too often lack the time, expertise, and flexibility to work beyond immediate deadlines.

The kind of drastic ones usually reserved for the post-breakup period. I personally have been seriously considering adopting pets, getting tattoos, and planning a proposal.\nMaybe it\u2019s that it feels like the end of the world. We\u2019re ready to call up old flames and confess our love, drop money on the things we\u2019ve always dreamed of having, quit our barely existent jobs, and move across the country.\nBut what\u2019s the actual explanation behind all of these impulsive decisions?\nI talked to psychologists to find out what\u2019s going on.\nAccording to Viktor Sander, a counselor at SocialPro specializing in human behavior, this kind of behavior might actually be helping us out:\n\u201cThere\u2019s an evolutionary benefit to being more impulsive in times of crisis. History has rewarded individuals who were able to make quick decisions in pressing situations. When things return to normal, we can go back to a slower decision making process.\u201d\nMegan Colleen Johnson, a Life & Confidence Coach has noticed a primary cause for this impulsive behavior in her clients:\n\u201cDue to social distancing and a sudden lack of security, people are being forced to deal with their inner voices. These inner voices include intense waves of emotions (fear, anxiety, frustration), noticing patterns they dislike about their lives currently, and a resurfacing of old coping mechanisms, all of which often result in impulsive action.\nBecause our body's primary goal is survival, these fast and impulsive actions are an easy way to quiet the inner dialogue and to feel some sense of control instead of feeling into the emotions and patterns that are actually being brought into the light. This is not necessarily a bad thing; in our personal life, this can actually be very supportive as we take immediate action to play, lean into our creativity, and cultivate freedom in the confines of our social distancing. It\u2019s a process of fully allowing our emotions, noticing what we feel ready to lean into, and where we can take action in beneficial ways (whatever that may look like for each individual).\u201d\nNancy B. Irwin, a Los Angeles-based psychologist, linked the phenomenon to a classic psychological response and the uncertainty of the whole situation:\n\u201cWe sometimes take drastic measures during a crisis because our fight-flight response is triggered. Some feel \u201cthis is it\u2026.I may as well try that new haircut, or have a dog to help me through this.\u201d Our impulse is to live while we can, because death may be near. There is the death of life as we know it in many ways, at least temporarily.\nThe gift of this crisis is that we get to see just how much we take for granted. We get to see what is truly important. In Chinese, the symbol for chaos is also the symbol for opportunity. What can be born now? The freedom to try a new bold haircut, the freedom to let go of bad habits, unhealthy relationships, or jobs?\nWe are forced to reckon with the unknown right now, and that triggers our primal fears. We have never experienced such a pandemic before in this country. There is really no template; and that in and of itself can spark impulsivity.\u201d\nCarole Lieberman, a Board Certified Psychiatrist with a Masters in Public Health, has a unique connection to the coronavirus pandemic. She has formulated the Coronavirus Stress Test to determine if people have Coronavirus Stress Syndrome, an overreaction that could weaken one\u2019s immune system and make them more vulnerable to the virus.\nCarole believes people are more impulsive during this pandemic for two major reasons, one being that \u201cthe media is making us feel as though we\u2019re all gonna die. Though this isn\u2019t true, it has panicked people and made them wonder about what else is missing from their life \u2014 besides toilet paper. They think of things they had once toyed with doing \u2014 like changing their hair, writing a book, leaving their relationship, rescuing a pet, and so on \u2014 and ask themselves, \u2018If not now, when?\u2019\u201d\nAnother reason for the impulsiveness could be that \u201cwe are being forced to make changes that we don\u2019t really want to make \u2014 like isolating or not coming in to work or not meeting our friends for lunch. This spurs us on to think about making our own changes. Most people don\u2019t like change, but once we are forced to make one or more changes, it puts us into a frame of mind of taking chances on other things, as well.\u201d\nKristen Fescoe, the Clinical Program Manager at Resility Health, believes impulsiveness may be a positive result of our change in routine:\n\u201cIt seems odd that people will often make seemingly impulsive decisions and life changes in the midst of a crisis. Some might look at fear as the reason why, but it\u2019s likely that something else is at work.\nWhen it comes to times of crisis, many people experience the need for change because they have more clarity than during the hustle and bustle of everyday life. When we are caught up in our lives and schedules it\u2019s easy to put things off that we want to do. The \u201cI\u2019ll get to it tomorrow\u201d mentality is easy when we are rushed and overscheduled.\nWhen life forces us to slow down and take a breath, that \u201cI\u2019ll do it tomorrow\u201d quickly becomes a \u201cno better time than the present\u201d mindset.\u201d\nKaren R. Koenig, M.Ed., LCSW a Psychology of eating psychotherapist, author, and blogger, had a few explanations for why we may be prone to making drastic decisions:\n[People] may be extremely frightened, a feeling they shut off until they\u2019re feeling numb or nothing. Doing something exciting breaks through the numbness and paralysis and makes them feel alive.\n[People] may be frustrated (consciously or, more likely, unconsciously) at constantly being told they can\u2019t do this and must do that. By engaging in daring or different behavior, they are asserting their individuality and sense of efficacy. In a way, they\u2019re saying, \u201cYou can\u2019t tell me what I can or can\u2019t do. I\u2019ll do what I want.\u201d\n[People] may be taking action to distract themselves from the panic they\u2019re feeling. Adopting a puppy shifts their focus and mental energy to something positive, as does making other major decisions. Focused on something new and challenging, they can forget (at least temporarily) that they feel imperiled.\nFight or flight response, the need to have some sense of control when our world is in disarray, a rebellious urge to defy the norm in a society that has been turned upside down, and a genuine fear that this could be The End all play a role in our impulsive decisions.\nAnd they aren\u2019t all bad.

Now, of course parents who conceive in a traditional way aren\u2019t governed by these standards, but it still sends a strong message about which lives we value.\nIf someone with ovaries wants to donate their eggs, there\u2019s a long list of attributes that will disqualify them. These standards are set by the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, the FDA and the CDC:\nbeing a weight that is too low or too high (as defined by the medically irrelevant BMI)\nhaving had someone in their immediate family die by suicide\nexperiencing irregular (non-monthly) periods\nbeing over 30 years old (in some cases)\nrelying on Medicaid, food stamps, or other financial assistance\nhaving recent smoking or drug history (including cannabis use)\nbeing \u201cunhealthy\u201d (which is not easy to define without discrimination and stigma)\nAdditionally, the egg donor requirements specify that donors must be \u201cwell-educated,\u201d have a supportive partner, family, or friend, must be able to access to family medical history up until their grandparents, (which is sometimes a privilege in itself) and must possess the maturity and preparedness needed to engage in the process of helping people conceive.\nAnd that\u2019s not for pregnancy \u2014 that\u2019s just for donating an unfertilized egg.\nPhoto by Jordan Bauer on Unsplash\nIt starts to sound a bit like eugenics. Many people who already have biological children would certainly not pass an egg donor screening.\nGatekeeping who gets to give their eggs away with ableist, classist egg donor requirements is a way of defining which children \u201cshould\u201d be born. If we were to require almost all embryos ever created to be carried to term, that would force pregnancy on many people who are technically deemed \u2018unfit\u2019 to reproduce.\nEven if you personally believe every pregnant person who is over/underweight, mentally ill, homeless, undereducated, all alone, facing poverty or struggling with a substance abuse disorder should carry a fetus to term, the reality is that our systems will often fail those people and the children they bring into the world. And implicit biases, judgement, ignorance, and discrimination will keep pro-life advocates from offering the help needed in order to allow those children to survive.\nSo, what about adoption then?\nNever mind that the adoption industry is riddled with questionable ethics, human trafficking, coercion, racism, homophobia, classism, etc.\u2026the bottom line is that adoption is not an alternative to abortion.\nDespite what the media may tell us, adoptions aren\u2019t the beautiful by-products of unwanted teen pregnancies or resentful people who are \u2018unfit\u2019 to parent. Even people who would parent if they could are often coerced into putting their children up for adoption.\nThe people who seek abortions are not would-be parents, they are just people whose reproductive systems functioned.\nPhoto by Austin Lowman on Unsplash\nWanting a baby to be born and then put up for adoption is to wish trauma upon a child. It doesn\u2019t matter how kind or wonderful their adoptive parents turn out to be. Every adopted child, no matter how old, will experience trauma. Maternal separation, which is naturally part of every adoption, is trauma in itself.\nAdoptive parents can never erase or rewrite an adopted child\u2019s history, meaning all the genetic illnesses, generational trauma, and perhaps \u2018undesirable\u2019 aspects of personality from their birth family will remain. The adopted child will always be missing something, whether they experience grief for it or not.\nPlacing a child up for adoption is not \u201cbetter\u201d than never having the child in the first place. Adoptive parents are not inherently better than birth parents.\nAbortion prevention happens long before an embryo ever develops.\nYou may think you want every fetus to be born, but in a country that does not value every parent and child, you can hardly call that stance pro-life.", "comment_count": 2, "like_count": 60, "created_time": 1651607729645, "comment": [{"user_id": "32808b445081", "comment_time": 1651607729645, "comment": "Thank you for sharing!"}, {"user_id": "ad47dcac4487", "comment_time": 1651690458716, "comment": "Provocative article.

The #MeToo movement forced us to start grappling with separating art from artist years ago and proved that many of us couldn\u2019t bring ourselves to condemn the comedians and filmmakers whose work we enjoyed.\nWhen it comes to Depp and Heard, it doesn\u2019t matter who anyone likes better. Despite how things often play out, justice isn\u2019t a popularity contest.

But we struggle to humanize celebrities, especially those we have deified like Depp. Some will always find a way to deny or forgive anything that paints him in a bad light. We often do that with partners too, especially those who manipulate us.\nAs a fan, I can acknowledge the beautiful performance he gave as a lonely outcast with a penchant for designing topiaries and quote Captain Jack Sparrow without equating his talent to morality.\nSometimes even in our personal lives, the truth of who someone is contradicts the curated image of them we have come to know.

It\u2019s devastating, but the worst thing we can do is beat ourselves up for not \u201covercoming\u201d the illness faster or rising above its influence altogether.\nWe compound the pain of depression when we hold ourselves to the same standards of productivity and excellence of neurotypical people with the right balance of brain chemicals.\nWhen we expect ourselves to function in the same way and achieve the same things that we did when we weren\u2019t depressed, we don\u2019t allow ourselves any space for healing.\nDepression is listed as a disability on job applications for a reason.

They were greeted by a small crowd, cheering, clapping, and shouting \u2018we love you.\u2019\nTrump stopped to give the thumbs up, but he looked tired. Melania walked straight into the building, leaving her husband outside to savour his fans.\nOnce inside, the couple went to their separate suites. Melania kicked off her heels, put her sunglasses on the table, and poured herself a vodka. She sat down in the big chair by the window and stared into the room. She drank a sip, and slumped back into the chair, her feet up on the crystal glass coffee table. She exhaled a long, slow breath, as if she was breathing out fully for the first time in four years. She reached for a cigarette from the marble and gold box by her chair, lit it, sucked in the smoke to the very bottom of her lungs, held it there, then slowly let it drift out. Her head spun a little, but her expression did not change.\nMeanwhile, down the corridor, her husband, the now former president, was escorted into his room by a Secret Service detail and the few remaining members of his team. Despite his suddenly diminished status, he required the same treatment he had enjoyed this last 4 years \u2014 those around him remained obsequious, calling him Sir with the same gravitas the title had when attached to the person of the president. He gave his coat and gloves to a valet, paused, and looked out of the window, his chin jutting out slightly in a style reminiscent of Mussolini in mid-flow, on a balcony in Rome.\nSir, his aide said nervously, the inauguration is starting soon. Trump turned and looked at him, silently, and walked into the dressing room, pulling at his tie. He slammed the door, leaving the aides standing awkwardly on the other side. Finally alone, Trump looked at himself in the mirror. He stared. He wanted to see the president, to find and keep that reflection. He wanted to check it wasn\u2019t washing away, that the fa\u00e7ade was not slipping to reveal the tired, sad man he had been hiding from these last weeks. This was already too long \u2014 he needed an audience to play to. He dressed for golf, and strode out into the lounge, past his guards and security detail. Get my clubs, he barked at a boy in uniform.\nDownstairs he was back in his game. People rushed up to shake his hand, punch his arm, and pat his back. He was amongst adoring fans again, feeling loved. He strode out, pausing to wave, to acknowledge the claps, and into his golf buggy. He played a round with gritted teeth. He knew that every television station was covering what should have been his inauguration. At least, he thought, that man won\u2019t have the crowds I had at my inauguration. \u2018That man\u2019 was all he could muster now, just as Putin never refers to Navalny by name, Trump had made it clear the name Biden had no place in his presence, or in his properties. He played golf, trying hard not to think about Joe Biden.\nMeanwhile, Melania was now mellow. She was a tiny bit tipsy, had smoked through a few cigarettes, and was lowering herself into a bath. Everything was slow now. She moved slowly, she breathed slowly. She had been thinking about this day for years, and planning for it, but now it was here, she was unable to do or feel anything, she was so exhausted that she just drifted through it. She no longer had to play the role, either of wife or of First Lady. She could now just be, and so she just was.\nShe lay in the bath and tried to think about what she would do next. Most obvious to her was that she could not continue her life tied to Donald Trump. He was fast becoming a pariah and a laughing-stock. He was surrounded by crackpots and sycophants, and all the \u2018real\u2019 people had gone. She liked the people with power, with money, and sophistication. She liked being at the top table, the Queen of America. But now she was just the wife of a failure. She was angry with him. He had messed up the last weeks so badly. It didn\u2019t have to be this way. They were no longer welcome in New York society, or abroad.\nThey both knew the deal would end soon. She would move on and find her own way in the world: a former First Lady, super-model, and wife of a millionaire, she would be ok. But she was not going down with his ship. As she lay in her bath, her mind floating now it was freed up by the vodka and nicotine, she planned.\nTrump thrashed at the golf balls, nudged them into the hole with his toe, and swore at his caddy. Today, even more than usual, everyone wanted to keep their distance from him. As the inauguration finished, so did the golf. Trump drove his golf buggy back and walked in, still dressed for golf, to have his lunch. He ate alone, a few people looking at him through the window. He went up to his suite, lay on his bed, and stared at the ceiling. Normally he would have the television on and would be scrolling through his phone and Tweeting. Today he could not watch television, and could not post. He fidgeted. He got up again, paced around the room.\nThere was a quiet knock on the door, and one of his aides entered. Mr Trump, Sir,.. he began, before Trump spun around and glared at him. \u2018Mr President!\u2019 he barked, you call me \u2018Mr President!\u2019 Yes Sir, er, Mr President, the aide muttered. \u2018Mr President, your wife wants to speak to you.

Very few of us living in democracies are old enough to have fought for it. We are the inheritors of our grandparents\u2019 victories and we often don\u2019t realise how hard they worked to build the democracies we enjoy. We were born into them, and as with any inheritance that we didn\u2019t work for, we risk taking it for granted and frittering it away.\nI\u2019ve written before that the simplest measure of success for a form of government is life expectancy. At the very basic level, we ask of those who rule us that their rule affords us health and longevity. This has, in many ways, been the basic measure of social systems since early humans first formed societies; those that worked out how to live longer thrived, those that didn\u2019t declined and vanished.\nDemocracies are good for health and longevity. By contrast, dictatorships and autocracies tend to have lower life expectancies, worse health, and less prosperity. In Russia, life expectancy is 71, in Germany it is 81.\nThere is a simple reason for this. In a democracy, where people can vote out their leaders, a form of political natural selection takes place. Those leaders who fail are removed from the political system, and those who succeed are given greater power. In fully enfranchised societies, politicians have to address the needs of those most vulnerable in order to get elected, and this leads to better public health outcomes.\nHowever badly democracies fail, and however rotten their politicians get, the political natural selection of a free vote means they eventually right themselves, replacing the bad politicians with better ones who turn things around again. America survived Trump. The UK will eventually eject Johnson and his corrupt and incompetent government.\nWell-functioning democracies allow people the luxury of forgetting they are in a democracy. Things work, so they don\u2019t require our attention. Democracy works so well, overall, that it is very easy to assume it has emerged as the only logical way forward for humankind. All the other systems have basically failed. They either end, like the great empires, or they come and go in flashes of horror, like the Third Reich. In political systems that do not afford people health, justice, and freedom, those people are miserable, and eventually they rise up and overthrow their monarch, dictator, colonist, invader or whomever is supressing them. Freedom and justice, health and wellbeing, are basic human desires, across all time and cultures.\nDictatorships fail because decision-making is not meritocratic or open to the process whereby a society can remove those making bad decisions. Russia is a prime example of this. One man is making the decisions based on a delusional and misinformed view of the world and influenced by the interests of only a tiny minority of society. Those decisions will exacerbate the misery and decline for most people, and eventually that will lead to the end of his rule. In badly run countries, like Russia, people die in larger numbers, procreate less, and leave when they can. This is why dictatorships never thrive or flourish. These are patterns throughout history that repeat every time. It may not be now, but eventually it will be this way.\nThe mechanics of why dictatorships fail can be seen in Russia\u2019s military failures in Ukraine. Russia\u2019s army is a reflection of the society from which it is formed. Putin created a country riven with corruption, with no rule of law, in which there is no truth. His army has turned out to be corrupt, without discipline, and full of lies. Battles go badly because money intended for equipment was siphoned off through corruption as it passed down the chain. Nobody tells the truth, so the reality of the battlefield doesn\u2019t pass up the chain of command. Soldiers are drunk, looting, and murderous, firing up the Ukrainians to fight harder, giving them a cause behind their fight that the Russians and mercenaries lack. Everyone lies to everyone, so the chain of command continues to pass back down orders that do not take account of the rot on the ground, and so the failure continues. Historically, armies like these lose wars, or mutiny, just as societies like this rebel or collapse.\nDespite a confidence and determination across the West that Russia will, eventually, lose this war, those of us still lucky to live in democracies should take it as a reminder that our democracies cannot be taken for granted. Hungary and Poland have gone from dictatorship to democracy, and back again to authoritarianism. They are not the first democratic societies to vote away their freedoms to populist regimes that that then become authoritarian, and from there evolve into autocracies or dictatorships. Democracy\u2019s greatest strength is also its biggest weakness: that everyone gets a vote. This means that skilful populists, like Viktor Orban, can persuade people to vote away that right to vote, and from there become entrenched enough eventually to avoid votes counting again.\nThis war in Ukraine has also shown us that democracy is not only not permanent, it is far from ubiquitous. The Economist calculated that \u201c32% of the world\u2019s population lives in a country where the government has supported Russia\u2019s actions,\u201d and that two-thirds of the world\u2019s population live in countries that either support Russia, or are neutral. The countries opposing Russia make up only 36% of the world\u2019s population, though they also represent about 70% of global GDP.\nDespite the fact that democracies are rich, powerful, and give people more freedom and longer lives, only 29% of the world\u2019s population currently live in liberal democracies, down from nearly 53% in 2000. Meanwhile, the number of people living in autocratic regimes has risen from 46% to 70% since 2000. Democracy is being attacked on all sides. China and India, rapidly growing economically and in terms of population, are not democracies and do not condemn Russia.\nBy population, the world is already predominantly not democratic. Democracies are declining, both because their populations are aging, and because people in democracies such as Hungary and Poland are voting away their democratic rights. America came close to doing the same thing, and may yet vote in an autocrat with anti-democratic tendencies. This would leave the people living in functioning, liberal democracies a frightening minority in the world.\nThose of us living in democracies, who want our children and grandchildren to enjoy the same freedoms we have \u2014 to live long, live well, and be free \u2014 we are a blip in history, our era is a mere spark of light in a long history of darkness. If we do not cherish, nurture, and defend our way of life, it will end up just as a chapter in a history book.\nRight now, that fight is in Ukraine. It is likely to be a long fight, and one which impacts on every one of us. We will end up paying for this battle, at least in higher energy bills, taxation, and inflation, if not more. It is up to those of us in democracies not to vote out our pro-democracy governments as punishment for the cost to us they may incur by protecting our way of life and opposing Putin. We must not be complacent about our way of life, and like our grandparents we need to be willing to suffer considerable hardships to preserve it. With Ukraine, this may not mean war in our cities, but it may require significant economic pain, migration, and political resolve. Our generation\u2019s version of fighting on the beaches may be that we have to support our liberal politicians while they take very difficult decisions, and not punish them when our food and energy prices soar, or our countries are flooded with refugees.\nDemocracy as we have enjoyed it could easily end, returning us to a life experienced by most people today, and by most people historically, in which we are not free, are poorer, and live shorter and sadder lives.

Either Russia will win, or Ukraine will win. If Russia loses the war it will be driven out of Ukraine. But we need to start thinking about what happens if Russia does not win but also does not lose. The war is at a turning point from where it could turn into a dreadful, protracted conflict that we may not be prepared for. The level of media coverage, political attention, and practical support the West is providing Ukraine will become hard to sustain if this war runs into months or years, rather than weeks.\nI believe that whatever the military outcome, Putin has lost his war in Ukraine. He has strengthened Ukraine, made her president a global hero, and he\u2019s undone all his hard work weakening both the European Union and NATO. Years of supporting the likes of Marine le Pen, Donald Trump, and the Brexiteers, both overtly and through social media campaigns, has been undone by this war. I\u2019m sure that Ukraine will be fast-tracked into the European Union, just as Finland and Sweden will join NATO. He has guaranteed the survival and growth of Ukraine and NATO.\nBut however certain it is that Russia will lose this war in the long term, we may be na\u00efve to think Russia will actually lose and end the war anytime soon. Putin\u2019s initial plan for a short and quick invasion leading to the installation of a puppet government in Kyiv clearly failed. The withdrawal of troops from the north of the country, and from around Kyiv, was a huge relief and clearly a tactical retreat. But it also enabled him to regroup his forces to focus on the East of Ukraine.\nMy concern now is that the Russian army and its collected mercenaries will go in hard in Eastern Ukraine, bombing and shelling it to rubble before troops sweep in to abuse, torture, and murder the few surviving inhabitants. Putin may win a large amount of land at a very great cost; he may gain control of the Black Sea, a land route to Crimea, and access to the mineral wealth of that region. Mineral resources will help him sustain his dysfunctional economy. Land will help him cling onto power in Russia, painting himself as an imperial leader, making Russia great again. He will also succeed in damaging Ukraine, hobbling her future, and slowing her progress. It will cost hundreds of billions to rebuild what he has destroyed.\nBut while the West will have to pay to rebuild the West, if Putin holds onto the East it will cost Russia a fortune to rebuild there, and it will never return to any sort of functional society under Russia. It may exist just as a source of resources and as a war trophy, but Putin will have to maintain it by force. Like Crimea, it will become a huge drain on an economy that will really start to feel sanctions over the coming years.\nMy worry is that any sort of Russian victory in the East of Ukraine will see Ukraine\u2019s army severely damaged and diminished. Potentially, Putin and his generals are banking on a long, slow battle in the East gradually deteriorating Ukraine\u2019s army. From the East, Russia could then drive West, back to Kyiv and beyond but facing much less opposition.\nIf this is the case, we are in for a very long, slow war. Russia has a history of throwing both cannon fodder and explosives at enemies for as long as it takes to defeat them. A dictatorship can force young men to the front in a way that a democracy cannot. It can also maintain horrendous troop casualties and deaths in a way that would just defeat a government in a democracy. Russia has no shortage of men, and no shortage of money with which to pay mercenaries.\nIf Putin decides he will not capitulate, or settle for new land in the East, and insists on taking Kyiv, then the West needs to be ready for a long and brutal struggle that will test us all. It will mean terrible casualties in Ukraine, an ongoing refugee crisis that evolves into a permanent mass migration across Europe, long-term high inflation, and crazy energy prices.\nThis risks creating deep political rifts across Europe. We are united now, but if this war becomes the new normal and the cost hits voters directly there is a danger of more populist and right-wing electoral wins. The politicians supported for years by Putin may come to power, weakening the resolve we\u2019re currently seeing across the EU and NATO.\nThis story reads in the news with all the urgency of a rapidly evolving situation that feels it will race towards a conclusion. But if this war runs into a year or more, how do we keep up our support for Ukraine? How do we keep the story alive, current, and relevant in the news? How do we avoid Ukraine getting pushed onto the back-pages like Syria, Chechnya, and so many other wars? How do we also avoid climate change and populism being side-lined by the war? It will be a complicated balance for politicians and the media.\nThe West, and Ukraine\u2019s many other allies, have a potentially very long and hard road ahead of them if they are to maintain their support for Ukraine. It is hard to know what more we can do to stop Putin now, apart from giving up the blackmail of Russian gas and oil, and continuing to arm Ukraine. The longer the war runs, the more likely it is to spill over into a NATO country, even if just by accident. The more desperate Putin gets, the more he will shut down his country into a worsening state of dictatorship, making him ever more isolated and less answerable to anyone. That in turn opens up greater risks of his crossing a line either with nuclear or chemical weapons.\nObviously, we hope Ukraine drives the Russian army back East to its border, leaving it too badly damaged to be rebuilt by a devastated Russian economy prevented by sanctions from buying the parts it needs to fix its hardware. Or, at least Putin settles for the parts of Eastern Ukraine he already holds. But we need to brace ourselves for Putin taking the East, pausing to regroup, and then moving West across Ukraine to take the whole country. We need long term plans, individually, nationally, and regionally.", "comment_count": 20, "like_count": 433, "created_time": 1650301882711, "comment": [{"user_id": "24a13075d8a4", "comment_time": 1650301882711, "comment": "Thank you for sharing!"}, {"user_id": "df74214abb39", "comment_time": 1650609768692, "comment": "I heard a US military general talking on a Hardcore History podcast a few weeks back - and he talked about poorly defined conditions for victory and the scope of the war.

Today I innocently posted a photo of some daffodils against a blue sky, thinking my social feed could do with a break from war posts. It immediately got liked by someone who viewed it as a pro-Ukraine gesture.\nVladimir Putin has thrust Ukraine into international fame. President Zelensky has gone from being a politician mainly known as a comedian to becoming a world leader who makes cowards like Putin look pathetically last century, and with whom every budding world leader wants to be associated.\nEveryone now knows Ukraine. We know the city names, the history, the culture. Ironically, in Putin\u2019s attempt destroy Ukraine and wipe out its presence on his border he has made Ukraine famous, loved, heroic and a force on his border that is stronger than it ever was before.\nPutin is trying to do what he and his colleagues did in the Soviet Union. There was a science behind how the Soviet invaders tried to eradicate the culture and identity of the countries they occupied after the war. They deported intellectuals and leaders to Siberia, with many dying on the journey or at the destination. They moved Russians into the occupied countries. They banned the culture and language. In every case they failed. Even countries like Estonia, with a tiny ethnic population, survived this attempt at genocide, emerging and flourishing again once the Russians left. Russia has never invaded a country and made it better than it was, or what it was to become afterwards.\nPutin\u2019s failure with Ukraine is on a different scale. The last time he was involved in attempted genocides, when he worked for the KGB, it happened over decades, and the countries recovered over years and decades. With Ukraine it\u2019s been weeks and he has already failed.\nUkraine is now a global superstar, and President Zelensky is world famous. Neither will disappear in the fog of Putin\u2019s war. Putin hoped Zelensky would vanish into obscurity, in exile or in a ditch. Instead, kids will have his face on their t-shirts for decades, long after Putin is consigned to the trash bin of history.\nAnd by contrast, Putin has totally destroyed brand-Russia. Within just a matter of weeks, Russia has become so toxic that no credible Western company can be seen to be doing business with or in Russia. Putin has returned his country to the depths of the Soviet era, when Western visitors would take Biro pens and Western cigarettes to bribe officials or thank hosts.\nWhile national sanctions have been harsh, the popular boycotts have been sweeping and far-reaching. Putin is now evil in the popular consciousness. He is a war criminal who has sent an army in to bomb women and children. Regardless of the military outcome, Putin has lost this war. The more he tries to crush Ukraine, the stronger it will grow. He\u2019s forced the whole world to pick a side, and most of the world has picked Ukraine.\nPutin\u2019s invasion is being heralded as a massive miscalculation militarily and politically, but it goes much further. He has achieved the exact opposite of all his aims; he has united NATO and the EU, boosted Western military spending, and he has strengthened Ukraine more than any Ukrainian politician in recent years, and by the time this war ends, Ukraine will be in the EU, and Finland and Sweden will have joined NATO.\nRarely has a country become a pariah so fast. Russia is arguably now in the same brand space as North Korea and Myanmar. It will take generations for Russia to recover from what it is doing to Ukraine.

I mean, how can we recognize something we\u2019ve never encountered before? How can we recognize sincere, authentic love if we\u2019ve never felt loved before?\nI spent years ignoring some pretty basic red flags because they were everything I knew. I didn\u2019t know what it was like to have someone genuinely interested in my thoughts, emotions, and well-being. I didn\u2019t know what it was like to feel respected and admired.\nBasically, I didn\u2019t know any green flags.\nThe familiar becomes the norm, no matter if it\u2019s positive or negative. Now that I\u2019m in a loving, secure relationship, green flags have become the norm, and I want to share some of them with you.\nHere are 6 clear signs your relationship will last.\n1. You\u2019re both aware of your own patterns.\nRelationships are our biggest mirrors. Unfortunately, most people project their fears and insecurities onto their partners and replicate the relational patterns they\u2019ve learned in their past relationships.\nThis means they let their past dictate their future, and then they wonder why they keep attracting the same kind of people over and over again and having the same kind of relationship over and over again (not judging \u2014 been there, done that).\nOn the other hand, if you and your partner have awareness of your own patterns \u2014 if you know what triggers you, what makes you feel anxious, or why you have certain fears \u2014 then your relationship has one of the greatest foundations it could have.\n2. The communication flows effortlessly.\nEffective communication is a clear green flag.\nEmotionally mature people know how to communicate their needs and wishes. There\u2019s no push-pull, no mind games and no beating around the bush \u2014 which may be something new for you if you\u2019re used to unstable, chaotic relationships with emotionally unavailable people.\nWhen my partner and I started dating, I was amazed at how easy and transparent our communication was. I even told him my adoption story in one of our very first dates \u2014 something that only my closest friends know, but for some reason, it felt natural to open up with him.\nHonesty and vulnerability take place spontaneously when you\u2019re with someone who shows you what real communication feels like.\n3. You respect each other\u2019s boundaries.\nIn the same way that you don\u2019t know what secure love feels like if you\u2019ve never felt truly loved before, you probably also have no idea what boundaries are if you\u2019ve spent years dealing with people that don\u2019t respect yours.\nBoundaries can be a foreign concept for people who grew up in enmeshed families. If you spend years absorbing the message that your individuality doesn\u2019t matter, and that you should always put others\u2019 needs above your own, how could you possibly know how to draw boundaries between you and other people?\nThe good thing is, emotionally mature individuals will naturally respect your boundaries, even when you\u2019re not setting your boundaries consciously. They will do their best to make you feel respected and appreciated.\n4. You don\u2019t put pressure on each other to meet every need.\nHealthy relationships involve knowing that it\u2019s not our responsibility to meet ALL of our partner\u2019s needs. In fact, it\u2019s literally impossible to do so.\nSure, there has to be mutual effort \u2014 but that effort flows effortlessly when two people love each other. This doesn\u2019t mean you have to take care of them all the time, or expect them to read your mind and know what you need.\nYour needs are primarily your responsibility. You\u2019re in charge of caring for yourself, and you need to do what it takes to get your needs met. Ironically, it\u2019s when we don\u2019t take care of ourselves that we expect others to do it for us.\n5. There\u2019s no judgment.\nDeep, authentic relationships stem from our ability to release judgments and accept the fact the each one of us has the right to express our inner realities.\nWhen it comes to feelings and emotions, there\u2019s no right or wrong. There\u2019s no certainty or predictability. All we can do is allow ourselves to feel everything that arises and acknowledge our partner\u2019s right to do the same.\nIt can be incredibly hard to find people that let you be who you are and give you the space to show your true colors \u2014 but it\u2019s possible, and it\u2019s a very good sign that you\u2019ve found a keeper.\n6. You both know how to handle adversity in life.\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve met people that never take responsibility for their words and actions. They blame their boss, their co-workers, their parents, their ex\u2019s, their friends \u2014 everyone but themselves.\nThese people don\u2019t know how to handle adversity in life. They\u2019re deeply unhappy and will drag you down with them every chance they get.\nOn the other hand, there are individuals who know how to stay calm under pressure and will make you feel safe and protected no matter the obstacles you\u2019re facing. It\u2019s not that they\u2019re insensitive or heartless \u2014 quite the contrary, they use their inner realities as a strength and they turn inward for guidance.\nThis is the kind of people you want in your life.\nIf you and your partner are able to push through adversity, recognize your own shortcomings and find reasons to stay when things get tough \u2014 your relationship will definitely last.\nGreen flags can become the norm in your life too if you refuse to settle for anything less.\nAs we\u2019ve heard so many times, we accept the love we think we deserve \u2014 meaning, the love we\u2019re used to receive. This means that if you tell yourself you\u2019re broken and unlovable, the relationships in your life will confirm these beliefs and make you feel broken and unlovable.\nIf, on the other hand, you know you deserve to find someone who loves you and fights for you, that\u2019s exactly what you\u2019ll find.\nYou don\u2019t have to be a victim of your circumstances. The choice is yours.\nThank you for reading!

She said she thought the two were engaged in what she \u201csaw as mutual abuse\u201d initiated by one or the other, in part as a result of their separate experiences with abuse growing up.\nSince Anderson\u2019s testimony, the phrase \u201cmutual abuse\u201d has become a point of contention in discussions online. It it really a possibility? Does mutual abuse even exist?\nLet\u2019s find out.\nMutual Abuse: What Do The Experts Say?\nSome psychologists say mutual abuse doesn\u2019t exist. Dr. Betsy Usher says \u201cabuse is about power and control. In an abusive relationship, only one person has power and control. Both people can\u2019t have equal power and control\u201d.\nMore often than not, what happens is the abuser convinces the victim that they are the only ones actually doing the abuse (gaslighting at its best).\nStephanie Thurrott, a journalist and trained domestic violence advocate, tends to agree, but says mutual abuse does exist \u2014 however, \u201cit is rare\u201d. She also says,\n\u201cWhat might be perceived as mutual violence is often violent resistance \u2014 that\u2019s violence in response to violence, not violence used to control a partner.\u201d\nJanie Lacy, a licensed psychotherapist specializing in relationship trauma, said extremely volatile relationships may be described as \u201cmutual abuse,\u201d and that in many cases, this dynamic stems from trauma. These relationships are called trauma bonds: relationships where both partners reenact each other\u2019s fears and insecurities.\nHaving this in mind, it\u2019s possible to conclude that mutual abuse does exist, but it\u2019s very rare and, most importantly, the term is often used as manipulation a victim-blaming tactic.\nSo What Does That Mean?\nThere are 3 possible scenarios:\nScenario 1: Depp was the abuser, and was victim-blaming and manipulating Heard.\nScenario 2: Heard was the abuser, and was victim-blaming and manipulating Depp.\nScenario 3: Their relationship was one of the rare cases where there was indeed mutual abuse. They were both violent towards each other, either emotionally, verbally, or/and physically. They were replicating the same patterns they absorbed as children (we already know both of them grew up in very chaotic homes. Depp experienced childhood abuse from his mother, and Heard was also beaten up by her father).\nThe way I see it, the third scenario is the most likely. And if there was only one abuser, I\u2019d say it was Heard. Here\u2019s why.\nWhile there is evidence that he was emotionally and physically unstable (there are videos of him clearly intoxicated and/or yelling at her, as well as photographs of Heard with bruises) it\u2019s not clear he was the (only) abuser.\nLaurel Anderson, the couple\u2019s marriage counselor, said that Heard told her she had started fights and physically attacked Depp on some occasions over fears Depp would leave her, \u201cbecause abandonment was her worst nightmare\u201d \u2014 which aligns with her BPD diagnosis. Heard admitted to smashing a door into Johnny Depp\u2019s head and punching him in the jaw, and there are many recordings that clearly show she was violent \u2014 and just as unstable as him, if not more.\nAnderson also said Heard was unsure what to do about the deteriorating marriage \u2014 and even asked if she would have an \u201cadvantage if she leaves him and files with police for abuse first\u201d. This demonstrates how manipulative and calculating she can be.\nIn the #MeToo era, abuse allegations are usually followed by waves of victims coming together and having the courage to talk about their experiences, just like in the Harvey Weinstein trial. However, this is not the case with Depp. None of his past partners followed Heard\u2019s example of \u201cspeaking up against abuse\u201d. He has no history of domestic violence.\nCatherine \u201cKate\u201d James, Heard\u2019s former personal assistant, confirms Heard was a very volatile person and had episodes of \u201cblind rage\u201d.\nMany witnesses have described Depp as the quiet one, including Anderson and James. Anderson said \u201cMs. Heard had a jackhammer style of talking. She was very amped up. He had trouble talking at a similar pace. He was cut off a lot\u2026This is how he didn\u2019t have a voice. He couldn\u2019t keep up with her rapid-fire way of conversation as he was really overwhelmed\u201d. James said Heard was \u201cDepp was the peaceful one\u201d, while Heard was \u201cfrequently intoxicated\u201d and \u201cverbally abusive, including to her own mother\u201d.\nNone of us can actually know what happened between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard \u2014 the truth of their relationship is something only the two of them can truly know.\nHowever, no matter what happens with their public legal battle, we need to be aware of the fact that the term \u201cmutual abuse\u201d is often used by abusers to gaslight, control, and manipulate their victims.\nMore often than not, abuse is not mutual: it\u2019s about a perpetrator who needs control and a victim who is controlled. It\u2019s about a perpetrator who is verbally, emotionally, and/or physically violent, and a victim who is doing their best to survive (and, sometimes, who doesn\u2019t even know they\u2019re a victim).\nThank you for reading!

Psychological Diagnosis of Amber Heard Explained", "content": "BPD And HPD? Psychological Diagnosis of Amber Heard Explained\nWhy is her diagnosis relevant to the trial?\nPhoto of Amber Heard via USA Today.\nThe defamation trial in Virginia between Johnny Depp and his ex-wife Amber Heard has become a battleground over the truth about their relationship.\nIt all started with Heard accusing Depp of domestic violence. However, there\u2019s more to the story \u2014 not only does Depp say he has never struck a woman in his life, but he also claims to be a victim of domestic abuse from his ex-wife.\nForensic psychologist Dr. Shannon Curry, who was hired by Johnny Depp\u2019s legal team, has testified in the defamation trial that Amber Heard suffers from two types of personality disorders: histrionic personality disorder as well as borderline personality disorder.\nA personality disorder is \u201ca type of mental disorder in which you have a rigid and unhealthy pattern of thinking, functioning and behaving\u201d.\nBut what is, exactly, borderline personality disorder? What about histrionic personality disorder? And, more importantly, why is the diagnosis relevant to the trial?\nLet\u2019s dive in.\nBorderline Personality Disorder: Symptoms & Causes\nBPD is marked by an ongoing pattern of extreme moods and emotional reactivity. People who suffer from BPD often struggle with an intense fear of abandonment, which leads to extremely unstable and chaotic relationships.\nThe DSM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) lists nine symptoms of BPD:\nFrantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment: Excessive calling, seeking reassurance, codependent patterns, manipulative or controlling behaviors;\nA pattern of unstable interpersonal relationships that alternate between idealizing and devaluing the relationship: A cycle of love/hate relationships or stormy on/off relationships;\nIdentity disturbance and a markedly and persistently unstable self-image or sense of self: Alternating between pride and shame, or confidence and extreme insecurity;\nImpulsivity in at least two areas that are potentially self-damaging: Spending money, sex, substance abuse, reckless driving, binge eating;\nRecurrent suicidal behavior, gestures, or threats, or self-mutilating behavior: Self-harm behaviors such as cutting, threatening to harm oneself or commit suicide, suicide attempts;\nAffective instability due to a marked reactivity of mood: Intense episodes of sadness, irritability, or anxiety usually lasting a few hours and only rarely more than a few days;\nChronic feelings of emptiness: Feeling empty, numb, or as though they have no true self, worth, or purpose;\nInappropriate, intense anger or difficulty controlling anger: Frequently losing one\u2019s temper, becoming angry or destructive, getting into frequent conflicts or fights with people;\nTransient, stress-related paranoid ideation or severe dissociative symptoms: Thinking others are out to get them, intend to hurt their feelings, plan to abandon or betray them, or having out-of-body experiences or \u201cblacking out\u201d.\nIn order to be diagnosed with BPD, one must have at least 5 of these symptoms.\nThere\u2019s no single cause of borderline personality disorder and it\u2019s likely to be caused by a combination of factors, such as genetics and childhood trauma. (apparently, both Depp and Heard suffered childhood abuse. Depp experienced abuse from his mother growing up, and Heard was also beaten up by her father).\nIn what comes to Heard\u2019s psychological evaluation, Dr. Curry said \u201cThere were a number of characteristics consistent with the eventual diagnosis, but some of the primary characteristics were essentially externalization of blame, tending to have a lot of inner hostility, a tendency to be very self-righteous.\u201d\nDr. Curry also explained that other types of behavior commonly seen in people with similar scores to Heard on the test include being \u201cpassive-aggressive\u201d as well as \u201cneedy of attention\u201d, \u201cfull of rage\u201d, and a tendency to \u201cuse manipulation tactics\u201d \u2014 all of which are traits of BPD.\nHistrionic Personality Disorder: Symptoms & Causes\nJust like BPD, the exact cause of histrionic personality disorder is not known, but many mental health professionals believe that both learned and inherited factors play a role in its development.\nThe word histrionic means \u201ctheatrical\u201d or \u201cdramatic\u201d. HPD involves a tendency to view situations emotionally, which leads to dramatic reactions and behaviors. Symptoms include:\nSeductive behavior;\nAttention seeking behaviors: dressing dramatically, making up or exaggerating stories, competitiveness, making up or exaggerating symptoms of an illness, etc. (according to Dr. Curry, Heard exaggerated symptoms of PTSD);\nSuperficial emotions that fluctuate rapidly;\nFocus on physical appearance;\nVague and showy speech;\nNow, let\u2019s talk about what really matters.\nWhy Is The Diagnosis Relevant To The Trial?\nThe diagnosis is relevant because it points to the possibility that maybe Heard was not just a victim like she says she was \u2014 maybe she was the perpetrator too. Maybe they were both violent towards each other, or maybe she was the abuser.\nIn fact, that\u2019s exactly what Dr. Curry says.\nRelationships with people who are diagnosed with borderline personality disorder can be particularly intense and filled with conflict. Anything can trigger their fear of abandonment, and when that happens, their mood becomes extremely explosive and unpredictable.\nOne thing is certain: until now, there\u2019s much more evidence of violence from her. Although there are some videos where he\u2019s clearly upset, there\u2019s no evidence of him hitting her \u2014 and there\u2019s plenty of evidence of her being violent towards him.\nAmber Heard even admitted to smashing a door into Johnny Depp\u2019s head and punching him in the jaw.\n\u201cA BPD relationship cycle refers to a repeating, continuous series of highs and lows in a relationship with someone with borderline personality disorder. First, everything feels good, uplifting, and safe \u2014 they might think of you as their favorite person. In the blink of an eye, there is anger or extreme rage, chaos, and escalating negative emotions. This kind of cycle can be a shock.\nSilvi Saxena, in Choosing Therapy\nBesides, people with BPD and HPD can be very manipulative. It doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re always consciously trying to manipulate others \u2014 more often than not, they\u2019re just unconsciously trying to get their emotional needs met (attention, validation, \u201clove\u201d).\nMaybe we\u2019ll never really know the truth about Depp and Heard\u2019s marriage.\nOne thing is certain: their relationship was incredibly dysfunctional, and it reminds us of how our childhood experiences affect our adult relationships.\nThank you for reading!

When bars, restaurants, and most other venues shut down, many resorted to catching up with friends and family over video calls or by taking socially distant walks.\nWhile Zoom calls leave much to be desired, it\u2019s worth asking whether the pre-pandemic way of socializing over drinks was much better.\nAsking ourselves some potentially uncomfortable questions about the way we get together could help us make important changes now that the world is entering the new normal.\nThe Sober Test\nWhy do we go to bars?\nOf course, not everyone does, but according to a 2017 report, 51 percent of Americans age 21 to 26 typically go to a bar at least once per week, followed by 42 percent of all millennials, 24 percent of Generation Xers, and 19 percent of baby boomers.\nBefore rushing back to our local hangouts or standing in lines behind velvet ropes, perhaps it\u2019s worth asking what bars are really for.\nFor many people, bars and booze serve as the original Tinder or Grinder, a socially acceptable way to shop for a mate. But not everyone in a bar is on the prowl. Some will tell you they go out for drinks to just unwind and have fun.\nThat\u2019s certainly true, but is there a deeper reason?\nThere\u2019s a simple test to find out.\nTwo years ago, I decided to stop drinking. While giving up booze has had many benefits, one significant downside is that many things I had previously found fun now seem downright boring. Going to a bar or nightclub sober, for example, suddenly became exceptionally dull.\nI call this the sober test: To test if you actually enjoy something, you have to try it sober. If you only find it fun while under the influence, it\u2019s likely the substance more than the experience that you enjoy.\nThe same test can be applied to all kinds of activities \u2014 and even to your relationships. Do you still enjoy your time with that friend or lover when you\u2019re both sober? And while I hate to be a buzzkill, you may find that other things you thought you genuinely enjoyed are mostly just an excuse to drink.\nTake spectator sports. Can you get through nine innings of a baseball game sober? Ever tried watching golf without a drink? Good luck.\nOf course, some sports fans love the intricacies of the game enough to get through it dry \u2014 more power to them! But I sure couldn\u2019t.\nI wasn\u2019t alone. One study found 40 percent of spectators at baseball and football games are on the sauce. Another poll found that 8 out of 10 Americans watch sports on TV at home with a drink in their hand.\nMany people can\u2019t dance unless they\u2019re drunk. Fellow members of the self-conscious club have been having trouble letting loose for thousands of years. The Roman philosopher Cicero said more than 2,000 years ago, \u201cAlmost nobody dances sober unless they happen to be insane.\u201d\nWhat about karaoke? When was the last time you got on stage sober to sing a cringe-worthy rendition of \u201cDon\u2019t Stop Believin\u201d? Hmmm. I wonder why that is.\nOf course, there\u2019s nothing wrong with any of these pastimes. I\u2019m no prohibitionist or killjoy. Sports, dancing, and singing are wonderful, and we should all enjoy them more often, not less.\nBut if these activities are inherently fun, which I believe they can be, why do so many of us need to drink to do them? Something\u2019s amiss.\nToo often, what\u2019s really driving us is a need for escapism promoted by the multibillion-dollar liquor industry that relies on selling an illusion.\nIs It Fun, or Is It Escapism?\nJust because an activity isn\u2019t fun sober doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t serve a purpose. If the sober test revealed that something you thought you liked is not intrinsically fun, maybe you\u2019re drawn to that activity for another reason.\nPerhaps when you combine the activity with alcohol, it becomes a permissible way for you to avoid reality, forget your problems for a while, and act in ways you can\u2019t without booze.\nBars and booze makers are happy to serve you a \u201ccup of cheer.\u201d In fact, bars are designed to be boring if you\u2019re sober, providing all the more incentive to keep drinking.\nThink of all the ways bars are built to get patrons to imbibe:\nThey turn down the lights because studies show doing so gets us to drink more in less time.\nThe music is so loud that it not only impedes any conversation below a shout but also impairs our hearing. If you can\u2019t have a conversation, what else are you going to do? Drink, of course!\nEvery aspect of the bar design, from the counter height to the kind of stools or chairs, helps to draw in people and keep them guzzling.\nDespite all the obvious and not-so-obvious ways bars are built to send as much drink down our throats as possible, the onus is still on us. These businesses are giving patrons what they want: a socially acceptable way to get out of their own heads.\nAnd that\u2019s okay! (To an extent.) People have been changing their states of consciousness for a long time, whether through meditation, ayahuasca ceremonies, prayer, reading books, or watching TV.\nUsing an activity to get out of your headspace and into a different reality for a while is fine. But let\u2019s be honest about why we do it rather than give it a bogus veneer.\nChoose Better Fun\nKnowing that some things we do are more for escapism than for fun, we can ask ourselves two things:\nWhy do I need this escape?\nThe craving for distraction is caused by an internal trigger, or negative feeling, that we wish to escape. By naming the preceding internal trigger, we can identify when we\u2019re feeling something that won\u2019t be solved by escaping reality.\nDid you have a grueling week at work and just want to blow off some steam? Have at it!\nOr, maybe it goes deeper than that. Maybe this bad week at work wasn\u2019t a one-off, and your job hasn\u2019t been bringing you enjoyment or satisfaction recently. In that case, escaping reality in a bar isn\u2019t going to solve the problem.\nIt may be time to take action rather than trying to numb the pain.\n2. Are there better ways?\nAs the pandemic has shown us, there are other things we can do with our time and money. There\u2019s an entire world beyond the bar!\nFor example, the U.S. National Park Service reported that May 2021 saw the highest ever number of recorded visits to Yellowstone National Park for the month of May. Other national parks saw similar spikes in attendance.\nAfter months of being confined to indoor spaces alone, people were rediscovering that the outdoors can also provide an escape, without chemical enhancements.\nPerhaps the next time you reflexively find yourself drifting toward a watering hole, you\u2019ll find something more creative to do than drinking?\nMaybe you\u2019ll ask a friend to go on a walk-n-talk through a local park? How about joining a sports league to meet other singles and play together instead of mindlessly staring at the action on TV? Perhaps you\u2019ll take a dance lesson so you\u2019ll know what you\u2019re doing on the dance floor?\nBy understanding our deeper motivations and understanding why we really do what we do, we can make sure we spend our time, and our lives, the way we want to.\nNir Eyal is a former Lecturer at Stanford and is the bestselling author of Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products and Indistractable: How to Control Your Attention and Choose Your Life.\nIndistractable won numerous honors and was named one of the Best Books of the Year by Amazon.\nBONUS: Nir offers a complimentary Indistractable workbook on his blog, NirAndFar.com.\n", "comment_count": 13, "like_count": 793, "created_time": 1645697567931, "comment": [{"user_id": "295258f6269d", "comment_time": 1645697567931, "comment": "Thank you for sharing!"}, {"user_id": "280736334cce", "comment_time": 1646016756109, "comment": "Good job.

For instance, someone might have an overwhelming fear of dogs because they were bitten as a child.\nThough not nearly as extreme, our trapped priors can shape how we perceive others.\nHave you ever known someone you just couldn\u2019t stand, but didn\u2019t really know why? Maybe it was some slight offense that turned you off to them and now you get uneasy every time they're around.\nThere\u2019s a well-known meme for this phenomenon. It\u2019s known as the \u201cbitch-eating-crackers effect.\u201d No matter what that person does, it can\u2019t be good. \u201cLook at Veronica over there; look at how she\u2019s eating those crackers\u2026 what a bitch!\u201d Of course, Veronica is probably perfectly harmless, but still!\nThe reverse is also true. We oftentimes treat people who make us feel a certain way better than they deserve. Several studies have shown good-looking people get better service, make more money, and are more likely to succeed in their careers.\nWe treat people better or worse because of how they make us feel and our feelings are highly influenced by our priors.\nTrapped priors exist because your perception of the world doesn\u2019t start with a blank slate every time you open your eyes. Rather, perception is a process of organizing and interpreting incoming sensations. This process is heavily rooted in past experiences \u2014 patterns you\u2019ve seen and mapped to what\u2019s happening now.\nThe best way I\u2019ve found to understand this is using an optical illusion. Take a look at the chessboard below, and notice how the square labeled \u201cA\u201d looks darker than \u201cB\u201d:\n\nIn reality, those two shades of gray are identical. Take a look at what happens when I remove the context that\u2019s creating the perception of two different shades:\n\nEveryone sees two shades of gray in that first image. We can\u2019t help it. We see two shades because our brains don\u2019t perceive the shades of gray simply as they are. We perceive instead a combination of patterns that we\u2019ve seen before: the pattern of a chessboard, the pattern of light and shadow.\nOur past experiences with these patterns make us see things not quite as they are, but as we expect them to be.\nNow, back to real life. For some years after I reached adulthood, my trapped prior perceptions of my parents created friction between us. It felt to me like every time I visited my parents, I became a teenager again \u2014 and not in a good way.\nEven though I was now independent, I\u2019d get into dumb arguments with my parents just like I did when I was in high school. Why? There was no reason to argue about small differences of opinion. We were all adults.\nAfter I had a child of my own, I grasped what was happening. My childhood experiences of my parents were coloring my adult reality. Even though I was grown up, whenever I was around my parents, part of me was still thinking about myself as a kid. A pattern or expectation from the past was causing me to see conflicts that weren\u2019t really there.\nIt\u2019s like the optical illusion: my view of the present was trapped by past experiences.\nReleasing Your Trapped Priors\nIn relationships, it\u2019s good to be able to let go of these trapped priors. It would be nice if we could treat our trapped prior perceptions of people the way we treated that optical illusion: wipe away the part of the picture that\u2019s creating bias.\nGetting rid of the \u201cbitch-eating-crackers\u201d variety of trapped priors is a bit less straightforward. However, it is possible to do something about it. If you take action, you can open up the path to forgiveness (or, at least, less bickering).\nThere are two things you can do to refresh trapped perceptions of people:\nSee people differently. When I became a dad, I stopped seeing my parents as authority figures, and I started seeing them as humans. Just like me, they weren\u2019t perfect. Just like me, they were doing their best. And like me, they wanted to let go of trivial disagreements. We often pigeonhole people into the roles they play in our lives, and judge them by the standard of \u201cparent\u201d or \u201cboss.\u201d But people have more dimensions than that, and you can build better relationships by looking at those other, different dimensions, not just the same ones we\u2019re used to seeing.\nGive people the benefit of the doubt. I wrote previously that the benefit of the doubt is the secret to kindness, and I still believe this. Most people mean well most of the time. I try to assume positive intent not just for their sake, but for my own. It\u2019s no fun to get into scuffles when there was never any ill intent in the first place.\nBy the way, the best thing about learning to release trapped priors is that you can also release your harmful perceptions about yourself. Many people miss out on the chance to be truly productive simply because at some point in the past, they decided they were incapable, or learning to be more productive just wouldn\u2019t work for them.\nIn reality, each day is a chance to take ownership of your time and spend it the way you want. By letting go of past perceptions of what you can or can\u2019t do, you\u2019re treating yourself with kindness and giving yourself a better chance to thrive.\nNir Eyal is a former Lecturer at Stanford and is the bestselling author of Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products and Indistractable: How to Control Your Attention and Choose Your Life.

Everything else is what\u2019s called a proximate cause. Those causes factor into the equation, but they\u2019re not at the core.\nConsider the game of pool.\nWhat makes the colored balls go into the pockets? Is it the white cue ball, the stick, or the player\u2019s actions? We understand that while the white cue ball and stick are necessary, the root cause is the player using the tools of the game. The white cue ball and stick aren\u2019t the root causes; they\u2019re only proximate causes.\nIn the game of life, it\u2019s often far harder to see the root cause of things. For example, when we\u2019re passed over for a promotion, we might blame that cunning coworker for taking our job instead of reflecting on our own lack of qualifications and initiative. Or how about when we get into a fight with our spouse over a lifted toilet seat? We might blame the conflict on one tiny incident, instead of acknowledging years of unresolved issues. And when we scapegoat our political and ideological opponents for the world\u2019s troubles, we choose to ignore (or at least, not seek to understand) the deeper systemic reasons behind the problems.\nThese proximate causes have something in common: they help us deflect responsibility onto something or someone else. It\u2019s not that the cue ball and stick don\u2019t factor into the equation (just like the coworker or toilet seat), but they certainly aren\u2019t entirely responsible for the outcome. Without understanding and tackling root causes, we are stuck being the helpless victims in a tragedy of our own creation.\nRoot Causes Of Our Distraction\nWe tend to blame our distraction on things like television, junk food, social media, cigarettes, and video games \u2014 but these are all just proximate causes of distraction. We blame them, while the root causes stay hidden. Solely blaming a smartphone for causing distraction is just as flawed as blaming a pedometer for making someone climb too many stairs.\nDistraction, it turns out, isn\u2019t about the distracting thing itself. It\u2019s about the discomfort we\u2019re trying to escape by distracting ourselves with something else.\nIf you\u2019re trying to escape the pain of something serious, the real problem is not your smartphone, Fitbit steps, or whatever may be keeping you occupied. The real problem is whatever you\u2019re trying to escape by turning to your phone. Without dealing with the discomfort driving the desire for escape, we\u2019ll continue to resort to one distraction or another.\nIf we accept that distraction is just another way our brain deals with pain, then it makes sense that the only way to handle distraction is by learning to handle discomfort. Only by understanding our pain can we begin to control it and find better ways of dealing with the negative urges it occasions.\nTime Management Is Pain Management\nUnless we deal with the root causes of our distraction, we will continue to find ways to distract ourselves. The root cause is the near-constant state of discontentment that exists in our brains due to eons of evolution. Moments of euphoric happiness are designed not to last too long, and satisfaction, in general, is temporary.\nThere are four psychological factors that make satisfaction temporary:\nBoredom: the lengths people will go to avoid boredom is shocking;\nNegativity bias: a \u201cphenomenon in which negative events are more salient and demand attention more powerfully than neutral or positive events\u201d;\nRumination: our tendency to keep thinking about bad experiences;\nHedonic adaptation: the tendency to quickly return to a baseline level of satisfaction no matter what happens to us in life. It\u2019s Mother Nature\u2019s bait-and-switch.\nDissatisfaction and discomfort dominate our brain\u2019s default state, but we can use them to motivate us instead of allowing them to defeat us.\nWithout our species\u2019 perpetual disquietude, we would be much worse off \u2014 possibly extinct. It is our dissatisfaction that propels us to do everything we do, including to hunt, seek, create, and adapt.\nEven selfless acts, like helping someone, are motivated by our need to escape feelings of guilt and injustice. Our insatiable desire to reach for more is what drives us to overturn despots; it\u2019s what pushes the invention of world-changing and life-saving technologies, and it\u2019s the unseen fuel that launches our ambitions to travel beyond our planet and explore the cosmos.\nIt\u2019s good to know that feeling bad isn\u2019t actually bad; it\u2019s instead exactly what survival of the fittest intended. From that place of acceptance, we stand a chance of avoiding the pitfalls of our psyches.\nNow that you are aware of what you are getting wrong about motivation and the causes behind it, you will be able to deal with the discomfort, rise above it, and become indistractable.\nNir Eyal is a former Lecturer at Stanford and is the bestselling author of Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products and Indistractable: How to Control Your Attention and Choose Your Life.\nIndistractable won numerous honors and was named one of the Best Books of the Year by Amazon.\nBONUS: Nir offers a complimentary Indistractable workbook on his blog, NirAndFar.com\n", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 443, "created_time": 1650435493668, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Life Lessons", "Self Improvement", "Writing", "Entrepreneurship", "Social Media"]}, {"author": "Matt Schellhas", "post_id": "68cc3d5a48a6", "user_id": "5a4b847349b3", "title": "The Sustainable Workload Loop", "content": "The Sustainable Workload Loop\nAlmost every manager I have ever had suffered from the same problem. You would look at their calendar and see meeting after meeting after meeting. One of those meetings was invariably \u201clunch\u201d, and was double booked with something else. Not only was that stressful for them, but it led to a situation where they didn\u2019t have much time to just sit and think about how to solve the problems that their team was facing. Some did that strategic thinking at home, robbing themselves of rest and undermining their personal lives. The rest just didn\u2019t do it at all, and their work suffered.\nWhen I became a manager I was wary of this trap. I figured that it would be difficult work to manage my time well with all of the added responsibilities of the role. Oddly, I find managing my time a lot easier as a manager than as a lead. As a lead I had to account for almost everything I do as a manager, plus all of the technical contributions expected of me.\nBut even that experience alone doesn\u2019t seem to explain my success. The biggest reason I think is my mental health problems. Struggling with mental health problems is certainly not uncommon, but mine are primarily around a general lack of motivation. Most folks can always find some small bit of motivation to do little things they don\u2019t really want to do. Take out the trash? Brush your teeth? It\u2019s annoying, but it\u2019s not a big deal. For me, those sort of little things are a bigger deal. If I don\u2019t reserve a stash of motivation, that stuff just doesn\u2019t get done. At a very early age, I had to learn how to manage my time well because the consequences were so ever-present.\nPhoto by nrd on Unsplash\nThere are two core parts to how I manage my workload. The first is a sort of grab bag that represents the stuff to do. It fills up over time: your boss asks you to write up a report, the cabinet door seems broken, you\u2019re getting hungry again, you wish you could give better presentations. As you do things, it empties: you finish the report and make sure your boss understands it, you figure out that hinge was loose on the cabinet and tighten it, you scarf down a burrito, you practice speaking in front of a mirror.\nThe second part of my mental model is a loop. We\u2019re all continuously making decisions on what to do \u2014 what to take out of the bag. Right now I\u2019m writing this article. When I stop, it will go back into the bag and I\u2019ll pick something else to do. That process repeats until we fall asleep only to wake up the next day and do it all over again.\nOur goal today is to optimize that loop across multiple axes. The managers with overfull calendars had problems because their bags were stuffed with things to do. Things got added to the bag faster than they could take them away. And they struggled when they took less valuable things from the bag simply because they were on the calendar. Minimizing any one of those problems in isolation causes the others to increase. There needs to be a balance, and there are multiple \u201cgood enough\u201d approaches to the problem.\nMy approach is akin to a funnel or filter. As work enters the loop, my brain runs it through a series of questions to see how I should handle it \u2014 or more importantly not handle it. Those stages can be summed up as four D\u2019s:\nDecline.\nLook, not all work is worth doing. People are going to show up at your door and want to waste your time. Your brain weasels are going to want you to go down that Internet rabbit hole. If there\u2019s no way that this work will beat out the stuff in your bag anytime soon, just say no. Declining work is the most efficient way of cutting down the flow into your grab bag of stuff to do, so is the first step in the filtering process.\nDon\u2019t be rude about it, but be swift and unambiguous. \u201cSorry Bob, I just have too much on my plate already\u201d. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t seem particularly valuable compared to <three things I\u2019m already committed to>\u201d. No, I will not engage with that troll. Declining work is very efficient, but it still takes time and effort. That cost to declining work is time and effort you\u2019re spending not doing valuable work. Don\u2019t get drawn into debates. Don\u2019t spend a bunch of time deliberating. If it is really important, it\u2019ll show up again later.\nDelegate.\nThe second most efficient way to get stuff done is to have someone else do it. Delegation is vital for managers, but it\u2019s useful for everyone. There\u2019s plenty of work that should get done that you\u2019re ill-equipped to do or you won\u2019t be able to get to soon. It takes more to delegate stuff than to decline it since you need to communicate what needs to be done, answer questions, and usually evaluate the results. And in many cases, the stuff will get done worse. That\u2019s okay. Delegating work means you can focus on the valuable stuff you can\u2019t effectively delegate.\nJust like declining, you don\u2019t want to spend a ton of time and effort delegating. Remember that you\u2019re doing this to save time. Yes, you want the person doing the work to be successful, but many people feel as though they need to micromanage things for them to succeed. That just leads to spending two people\u2019s time to do the work rather than one.\nDefer.\nIf work has made it here, you\u2019ve already decided that a) it might be valuable enough to actually do and b) you\u2019re probably the best person to do it. The defer step evaluates if you should do it right now. Almost always, the answer is no. You\u2019re probably already doing something. Humans are notoriously bad at multitasking. The cost of stopping what you\u2019re currently doing, putting it back in the bag of stuff to do, and then dealing with this new thing is waste.\nUrgency and context switching cost isn\u2019t the only thing to consider here. Many people struggle with time management because they think that time is the only resource they\u2019re optimizing. They pull out their Eisenhower Matrices, identify the most important seven hours of work, toss them in their calendar (with some buffer time to handle unexpected work). By the afternoon, they\u2019re exhausted by all of this high value work. The rest of the work either is done poorly or slips to tomorrow. They are stressed out by the plan failing, which hampers their ability to get things done tomorrow because now they need to deal with this stress too.\nIf you\u2019re not ready to do the work, defer the work. \u201cReady\u201d means a lot of things. Do you have the uninterrupted time to do the work? Do you have the energy and focus and motivation to get it done? Will you have enough reserve time and energy and focus and motivation to deal with the rest of your day? Do you have a good enough understanding of what \u201cgood enough\u201d is for what you\u2019re doing? Is this at least as valuable as other \u201cready\u201d things I could be doing? If not, don\u2019t do it. If it\u2019s borderline, don\u2019t do it. Put it back in the bag and make sure stuff is in there that will eventually get it to ready (like splitting it up or clearing out a block of time or having a good run). And just like declining and delegating, this decision is pure overhead \u2014 making a good decision cheaply is better than making a perfect decision at great cost.\nYes, when you\u2019re exhausted that means that sometimes your only option will be sitting in front of the television or some similar activity to recuperate. That\u2019s okay. Sometimes your guess about how costly something is will be wrong. Sometimes life shows up and you have to deal with it. Keep focused on getting stuff done well, even if that stuff is relaxing now so that you\u2019re more effective later.\nIt\u2019s also important to defer work well. As your bag of stuff to do gets full, it becomes harder to pick out the best stuff to work on because you have so many options. Just keeping track of all that work is a continual cognitive burden. When the stuff in the bag is vague, it\u2019s harder for you to pick up and run through this loop again. Automated reminders are a great tool for deferring things better, since they let you quickly deflect an interruption and mostly forget about it until the reminder starts the loop again. Humans already are conditioned to handle reminders like hunger and sleepiness. Leverage that to your benefit.\nDo.\nAwesome. You have found something that is valuable to do, you\u2019re the right person to do it, and you\u2019re ready to work on it. Now you just need to do it. Since multitasking and context switching are overhead, the goal is to take this one and only one thing out of your bag of stuff to do and hammer on it until it is done. It\u2019s in place. It\u2019s working correctly. It won\u2019t require baby-sitting or calibration. You\u2019ve learned what you can from the experience. Done. Some things are vaguer about their done-ness, like the example above about becoming a better presenter. Mostly, you don\u2019t want half-done things in your bag of stuff to do. They\u2019re costly to restart and hard to prioritize next to other work.\nWhere possible, you should strive to remove things from the bag entirely. This whole process is only sustainable when you can figure out how to empty the bag just as quickly as it fills up. If you\u2019re not deliberate about aggressively declining and delegating and getting work to done you\u2019ll quickly find yourself in the position of the managers with overloaded calendars: too stressed and busy and overwhelmed to catch up. As humans, we\u2019re highly motivated to relieve stress when we feel it, usually in expediently unproductive ways. The bag of stuff to do will reach equilibrium one way or another and by preemptively tossing stuff out, we can maintain some semblance of conscious control over it.\nA slight aside for technical readers.\nSome of you reading this might have noticed some parallels between this model and some technical systems you\u2019re familiar with.\nThe bag of stuff to do plus a loop is very reminiscent of a worker sitting in front of a queue (or a service in front of a database if you\u2019d prefer). When your worker/service can\u2019t keep up with the load, things start to deteriorate very rapidly and the only way to catch up is to drop the load for long enough for the system to recover. Rate limiters and other robustness mechanisms map pretty well to how humans should decline and delegate more work when their bags are full.\nYou\u2019ll also note that optimizing work across a few axes looks suspiciously like a Mathematically Hard problem. That is (in part) why the loop is focused on finding \u201cgood enough\u201d answers to the problem. It\u2019s also why things get so out of hand as the bag fills with items \u2014 the work to keep track of relative priorities and costs grows super-linearly.\nThis article will also look very agile to some of you. The bag of stuff to do is your literal backlog. The emphasis on done and work-in-progress should also be familiar. The sustainable workload loop has very little forward planning, and instead prefers on-demand prioritization. Agile isn\u2019t about managing work though (it\u2019s about culture and collaboration), so the parallels are more dangerous to draw. The best things to focus on are the inherent waste of context switching and the opportunity cost of deciding rather than doing.\nManaging your time isn\u2019t enough because doing stuff takes more than just time. Recurring work and trial periods (first month free! Your credit card will only be charged if you continue using the service!) are particularly dangerous because of it. It takes very little emotional energy and motivation to join. Extracting yourself from a recurring meeting, or even skipping one is more difficult. You worry about the messaging and how people will respond to it. People end up just going to the meeting because it\u2019s less costly, and look up one day to find their calendar bursting with marginally useful work.\nThis model of sustainable workload won\u2019t magically solve that problem. It will push you to decline and delegate the work before it shows up. It will help you understand how the drain of them can prevent you from being really ready to do other valuable work. I hope that it will push you to make time, not just for unexpected work but to make sure you\u2019re actually ready to get things done.", "comment_count": 3, "like_count": 769, "created_time": 1618513253898, "comment": [{"user_id": "5a4b847349b3", "comment_time": 1618513253898, "comment": "Thank you for sharing!"}, {"user_id": "73e36db6468a", "comment_time": 1619496238611, "comment": "Saying no is the most difficult one."}, {"user_id": "ee659212e44f", "comment_time": 1619897499058, "comment": "Really valuable article."}, {"user_id": "9bd74e12bf7e", "comment_time": 1622298692651, "comment": "Great post .\ud83d\udc4f"}], "post_tag": ["Time Management", "Project Management", "Self Improvement", "Leadership", "Delegation"]}, {"author": "Matt Schellhas", "post_id": "3896140e7dd6", "user_id": "5a4b847349b3", "title": "Communication is not Collaboration", "content": "Communication is not Collaboration\nPhoto by Sarah Kilian on Unsplash\nEvery so often, I hear a cry. \u201cThese teams aren\u2019t working well together! People don\u2019t know what the others are doing!\u201d and I groan (usually to myself), because I know what is coming. Some well-meaning person states the obvious solution: \u201cwe need more communication\u201d. Most heads nod, while me and a few others make token objections or simply resign ourselves to the rest of the process. Someone else suggests building a knowledge base, or maybe having a few more status meetings, or recording all of the meetings so that anyone could watch them, or writing more design documents, or maybe even using a wiki. After a little more debate over the implementation details, a few of these become action items for everyone to follow. Management is happy because now these teams will communicate more and everything will be right in the world.\nExcept it never works.\nAt best, you get some more informed teams that still don\u2019t work well together. The common case is that people try it out for a month or so, spending a few hours a week on something that most people hate and nobody really benefits from. Then it slowly dies off as one by one people cease seeing value in it. Don\u2019t worry. It will probably come up again in 3\u20136 months\u2026\nThe reason it never works is because people are solving the wrong problem. If your teams aren\u2019t working well together, then you have a collaboration problem, not a communication problem. Sometimes, the collaboration problems are simply the growing pains of a scaling organization. Instead of reducing the cognitive load, the organization responds by trying to scale their information exchange. I\u2019ve already written about why that doesn\u2019t work. But with the explosion in remote work, lots of teams are struggling to collaborate effectively for reasons other than too much organizational coupling. They don\u2019t work well with others, and \u201cmore communication\u201d doesn\u2019t fix that.\nStatus meetings and wikis and design documents are all broadcast communications. Sure, they convey information to more people, but they do it in a one-way manner; they do it in a sterile, impersonal manner. It\u2019s all talking at people rather than talking with people. Even with comments and feedback loops, they rarely have any sort of negotiation or compromise. It\u2019s hard to know who has read them, and harder to know what was understood. They don\u2019t build relationships. They don\u2019t build trust.\nWhen two teams are working well together, sending information is a very small part of it. Teams that collaborate also listen well. They understand the challenges facing the other team. The two teams usually have to negotiate responsibilities and processes between them based on those shared challenges. The teams have built various relationships so that communication is easy and safe. Teams that work well together, trust each other to take care of business.\nGreat. How to do that?\nThe same way you get a single team collaborating well:\nYou start with a good foundation of psychological safety. If people are scared to fail, they won\u2019t do risky things like trusting other people.\nThen you set expectations. It doesn\u2019t even occur to many people that part of their job is to build professional relationships with their peers. You will need to make it clear that it is not only a part of the job, but that effective collaboration is just as important as shipping widgets or closing deals.\nOnce you\u2019ve said the expectations, then you will need to back it up with action. Words are not enough. Even if someone ships a million widgets, they don\u2019t get promoted if they\u2019re impossible to work with (and vice versa; being good to work with isn\u2019t enough either).\nAnd all the while, you will need to provide feedback to people so that they know how successful they are. Does that style of collaboration not work for you? Let them know. Was that heads up really valuable? Let them know.\nThis is easier for managers to do because it\u2019s what their day to day job entails and because they (usually) can stop someone from getting promoted. But anyone can do this. You can be tolerant of mistakes, open-minded to other people\u2019s ideas, and accommodating to their needs. You can reach out and discuss the importance of a good working relationship. You can be less cooperative with someone who isn\u2019t being a good collaborator. And you can let collaborators know what about their collaboration is great and what is not-so-great.\nYeah, it\u2019s hard. If you haven\u2019t done it much in the past, you\u2019re probably going to be kind of bad at first. That\u2019s okay. This sort of squishy, qualitative people work is also far less visible than wikis and design documents and status meetings. Not everyone will understand why you\u2019re just talking with someone about what exhausts you, or listening to them rant about this new project they\u2019ve been saddled with. That\u2019s fine. People don\u2019t always understand why teams work well together, but they certainly miss it when it\u2019s gone.", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 5, "created_time": 1651599681098, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Communication", "Collaboration", "Management And Leadership", "Leadership", "Teamwork"]}, {"author": "Matt Schellhas", "post_id": "bf3e63cc0f3e", "user_id": "5a4b847349b3", "title": "Software Engineering: Puzzles and Dilemmas", "content": "Software Engineering: Puzzles and Dilemmas\nPhoto by Taras Hrytsak on Unsplash\nI am fond of saying that software engineering is all about tradeoffs. You can\u2019t make one program solve every problem, so much of the work is deciding which problems you are going to solve. But that isn\u2019t entirely true. Software design is all about tradeoffs. The actual implementation is less uniform.\nConsider a basic API that reads and writes to a database.\nWhat the endpoints to make, how to structure your database, and generally what the interface looks like is flexible. Your design will make tradeoffs \u2014 perhaps to improve ease of use at the expense of runtime performance, or perhaps to make maintenance easier even if time to market is slower. And while there are some clearly rubbish designs you could choose, there is no objectively Best Solution to these problems. The dilemma of which tradeoffs to make when none are clearly superior is one that software engineers face regularly.\nBut that\u2019s not all that goes into the API. You still need to write the code to communicate with the database, you still need to do input validation, you probably need to add some authentication, and you will still need to deploy the damned thing. There are far fewer tradeoffs here. Once the schema is designed, the programming language chosen, the API surface area defined, the names and function separation figured out (including the dreaded ORM debate)\u2026 the rest is mostly connecting the dots. This part of software engineering is more like solving a puzzle. Getting data to and from a database has a very unambiguous success criteria. Either the data is right or it is not. Even high level things like authentication and deployment are effectively solved problems these days. Just like any other puzzle, once you know the trick the whole thing becomes a matter of execution.\nWhy does that matter?\nBecause in my experience, this separation is one of the most important \u201cshapes\u201d when it comes to getting the shape of the team to match the shape of the work. I personally despise puzzles. Just executing a known algorithm is boring to me. It is drudgery. The payoff at the end when the puzzle is solved isn\u2019t nearly enough motivation for me to overcome all of the work necessary to get there. Some engineers love that part of the job though! Having a clear path to follow, and an unambiguous measure of success is extremely comforting to them. The process of solving the puzzle is satisfying to them, and the feeling when the work is complete is something they love to chase.\nEvery non-trivial software engineering project has both kinds of problems. It will have dilemmas where there is no single correct answer. Some dilemmas might not have any good solutions! You\u2019ll need people who are comfortable working with that sort of ambiguity. And there\u2019s going to be some problems that have known solutions. Some will be tedious, difficult puzzles to crack. You\u2019ll need people who enjoy that sort of challenge as well. The problem is that very few people are great at both.\nWhat to do about it?\nI hire around it. Yes, part of \u201cmake the shape of the team match the shape of the work\u201d is about experience with different technologies. If I have a bunch of hard UI work, then I\u2019m going to hire mostly experienced frontend people. But it also includes this dilemmas versus puzzles preference and other, less prominent preferences. If I can pair work up with people\u2019s strengths (what really engages them; not necessarily what they are great at), then people are happier and simply more effective because they\u2019re doing what they love.\nHow do I do that? Well, I ask them. In an interview, I will talk about different common motivators (pleasing customers, cracking a puzzle, designing a solution, accomplishing tasks, cleaning up a codebase, contributing to the company\u2019s mission, etc.) and then ask what sort of work gets them out of bed in the morning. Then I ask what sort of work do they dread. It\u2019s not about effectiveness, it\u2019s about how the work makes them feel (as clich\u00e9 as that might sound). Occasionally there is some follow up questions to understand why something like UI work or meetings might fill them with thrills or dread, but most folks can provide insightful answers. And there\u2019s no wrong answer! Sometimes my team needs someone who thrives in ambiguity, and sometimes I need someone who is driven to finish the puzzle.\nWhat not to do about it?\nUnfortunately, there are a few ways that companies make their lives harder when it comes to the different sort of problem solvers that teams need.\nThe first is the current FAANG style hiring process used by most tech companies which has a coding portion, a design portion, and a behavioral portion. The coding portion is often leetcode style problems for candidates to solve. There\u2019s usually only one way to manipulate that list in O(n) time, and if you know the trick, the puzzle is easy. The design portion is usually a nice, ambiguous sort of dilemma that will have multiple potential solutions (if your interviewer is open-minded/competent). I can accept the argument that a top tier software engineer should be good at solving both sorts of problem, even if they don\u2019t enjoy it. But that doesn\u2019t change the fact that this sort of interviewing practically guarantees that candidates will dread some part of the process. And knowing what they\u2019re good at is usually less important than knowing why they love to do some things.\nThen when engineers join they\u2019re often rewarded differently. \u201cSenior\u201d levels often come with leadership or mentorship expectations. Some companies will only hire engineers with leadership ambitions or can interface with customers. All of that work is filled with ambiguity. Even if puzzle loving folks can make good leaders, the entire concept of vague people work with no clear success is a terrifying prospect to overcome. Many will just look at all of the great implementation work they did, and wonder why they have to do all of that other crap to get promoted. More likely, you\u2019ll just end up with a bunch of folks who hate puzzles trying to do a bunch of puzzle work, leading to grumpy engineers and worse team performance. Or worse yet, you get a bunch of people doing as little puzzle work as possible, since that\u2019s not what will get them promoted.\nThe last failure mode comes when companies try to separate the valuable architecture work from all of the tedious puzzle work. Some even go so far as offshoring the puzzles. They think that if it\u2019s just a matter of executing some algorithm, then anyone can do it. Software engineering work is not so easily separated in practice. In the API example, the line between design and implementation is a fuzzy, curving beast that sometimes includes implementation details like function and variable names. In the end, you need the shape of the team to match the shape of the work. Separating architecture from implementation means your now-separate teams don\u2019t match the shape of their cohesive, intertwined work. Just because someone dreads puzzles or dilemmas doesn\u2019t mean they get to be completely free of them. It\u2019s still part of the job.\nYes, dealing with ambiguity tends to be a harder skill to master. The feedback loop for dilemmas is longer and fuzzier, meaning it takes more time and experience to develop those skills. But this isn\u2019t about skill. You\u2019re already interviewing for that. This is about motivation. It\u2019s about finding folks who will get out of their bed in the morning and actually look forward to their work. Because finding people who are capable of doing the job is only part of setting them up for success.", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 21, "created_time": 1650635314898, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Software Engineering", "Management And Leadership", "Motivation", "Hiring", "Ambiguity"]}, {"author": "Matt Schellhas", "post_id": "fbce7a4d330f", "user_id": "5a4b847349b3", "title": "QFR: What do you look for in new programmers?", "content": "QFR: What do you look for in new programmers?\n\nThis question comes from Emily and is one I get once or twice a year:\nHi. I just got my CS degree, but can\u2019t find a job. All of these places want programmers with min 2\u20133 years experience. People online say to apply anyway, but few companies reply. What do you look for when hiring new grads?\nFirst things first, you absolutely should apply anyway.\nThough the trend is changing, privileged folks (cis, hetero, white men here in America) will happily apply to jobs where they don\u2019t have all of the listed qualifications. Less privileged folks don\u2019t apply as much, in part because they think that their faults will be held against them. And unfortunately there is some truth to that. Some people you\u2019ll encounter in your search will let their biases get the better of them. The problem is that you can\u2019t know which opportunities will and which will not, so applying far and wide is more important when some companies will turn you away for no good reason. Using focused sites like Tech Ladies, Diversity Jobs, and POC IT can also be a good filter for companies actively working to mitigate their biases.\nAs for your core question, I personally look for some of the same things as my peers:\nIs your resume/LinkedIn fine? It doesn\u2019t need to be awesome. You don\u2019t have a ton of experience to show, so please don\u2019t try and oversell your experience \u2014 that just makes it clear that you don\u2019t know how much you don\u2019t know. Just avoid typos, unprofessionalism, messiness. No unforced errors.\nWhat languages do you know? A computer science degree is great, but most of your competition has CS degrees. What do you actually know? How did you learn it? What can we ask about in an interview? If it\u2019s unclear what you know, we\u2019re liable to assume that you don\u2019t know anything (since we get some of those candidates too).\nCan you write code? It\u2019s all well and good to show promise and to know your algorithms & data structures. But if you can\u2019t write code, I won\u2019t hire you to write code. Portfolios are okay, though they are so common now that they\u2019re not a good signal. Your github is okay, but unless it\u2019s very clear that you didn\u2019t just follow a tutorial, that isn\u2019t good signal either. Plus github and portfolios push this whole idea that \u201cyou need to code in your spare time to be good\u201d, which favors the privileged folks with ample spare time/energy. So I check for this in the interview. Can you write some loops without StackOverflow? Do you actually know the basics of your best programming language? Nothing complex, but it still excludes a lot of beginners (and non-beginners).\nThere\u2019s also some things that I look for that aren\u2019t very common. I do this because in my experience, these things correlate well with your success as a professional software engineer. Other hiring managers have different experiences, so have different beliefs. All the more reason to apply to a wide variety of roles.\nFirst, some things that I don\u2019t look for that somehow end up on resumes and in interviews anyways:\nI do not care if you are a \u201cfast learner\u201d. Everyone puts this on their resume, regardless of its truthfulness. Remember that you\u2019re no longer competing against the best students in your school. You\u2019re competing against the best students in every school. Depending on the role, you might be competing against the best students from every school over the past forty years. I don\u2019t mean to dissuade you, but to remind you that I get a lot of applicants who learn quickly and even more who say they do. If you really are a fast learner, show me what you\u2019ve learned. Show me how well you\u2019ve learned it.\nI do not hire \u201chard workers\u201d. I get a lot of applicants that focus on how hard they\u2019re willing to work. They talk about the extra hours they put in during their internship or at a summer job. Your ability to tolerate suffering is not the appealing trait you think it is. As a manager, you\u2019re telling me that you will set a bad example for others, probably have poor time management skills, and will maybe burnout when faced with adversity. Don\u2019t do it. Focus on dependability, or reliability, or willingness to adapt. Show me that you\u2019re interested in being a good teammate.\nI do not care how passionate you are about programming or my company or the industry we\u2019re in. Look, a good portion of your job is not going to be writing code. I\u2019ll do my damnedest to make writing code a big portion of the job, but there will be meetings. There will be debugging. There will be testing. There will be a lot of talking to people. There will be bureaucracy and other stuff that isn\u2019t very fun. The code you write as an entry level engineer is probably not going to make a huge impact for our customers or for the world. It is still a job. In my experience, that passion doesn\u2019t last. You need to show me that you can find enough motivation or pride or professionalism to sustainably do all of the job, not just the parts you are passionate about.\nBut there are also two things I look for because they correlate well with software engineers\u2019 success (at all levels):\nSigns of self-awareness. As a software engineer, most of your day is going to be alone \u2014 particularly now that distributed work is more common. Your lead is not going to spend hours a day with you. Your manager is not going to spend hours a day with you. Your peers are probably not going to be great at providing you feedback or coaching. Maybe your lead and your manager will be bad at it too. A little bit of self-awareness and introspection will go a long way in helping you grow as a professional. It makes my job easier because you already know some of the things we\u2019re going to talk about. Self-awareness is a fundamental dependency for building a good, sustainable work ethic since you\u2019re aware enough to know at least a little about what motivates you and what \u201ctoo much\u201d feels like. And it\u2019s something that you don\u2019t need any professional experience to exhibit.\nUnderstanding of implications. This is the big one. More than any other skill or trait or strength I\u2019ve encountered, the ability to follow implications is what best correlates with software engineering success. Does this candidate understand that \u201cif a then b\u201d? It\u2019s even more important for beginners, since it is nigh impossible to teach. And it is an essential skill for software engineering. All of the tradeoffs for program design require programmers to understand the implications of those tradeoffs. What the consequences are will come with experience, but you won\u2019t get that if you can\u2019t see how a tradeoff leads to various effects. Debugging becomes drastically harder when you don\u2019t understand what could lead to the symptoms you\u2019re seeing. Making code changes is far more dangerous when you can\u2019t imagine what sort of implications this change has on the wider system. Writing quality code is unlikely to happen when your brain can\u2019t easily understand how that code impacts customers who will use it and programmers that will maintain it. This is why \u201cshow the impact of your work\u201d is part of the common advice for more experienced engineer resumes. At any level, I look for it in interviews. Do you understand the consequences of a design? Can you accurately understand the implications of a tradeoff? As a new grad, it doesn\u2019t need to be great! I don\u2019t expect that you\u2019ll understand all of the nuances involved. I don\u2019t expect that it\u2019ll be lightning fast, or even that your inferences are accurate. Those will come with time. Those we can teach.\n\u2014 Questions From Readers is powered by folks just like you. If you have a question you\u2019d like me to write about, let me know!

It\u2019s a bit unusual to walk away from a job as a tenured law professor\u2014which is a fantastic gig, by the way\u2014at the age of 52 with no real plans, so I thought I would try to explain myself.\nThe title of this post is something that economist Diane Coyle said on a podcast when asked to describe her background, and I think it roughly describes my career \u201ctrajectory\u201d as well. There have been things that I very much wanted to do, and most of those didn\u2019t work out. Then there were things that I kind of stumbled into, and some of those worked out very well.\nThe summer before ninth grade, I auditioned for the Juilliard Pre-College Program. I didn\u2019t do it because I was particularly serious about music, but because I was one of the better cellists in Westchester County and I was looking for a good orchestra to play in during high school. I had no idea how good the kids at Juilliard were, and had I known I probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered trying. Somehow I was accepted, and I immediately found out that I was one of the worst cellists in the building. But I really fell in love with music, I practiced a lot, and by the end of high school I was one of the better cellists at Juilliard, although by no means one of the best.\nI wanted to be a professional cellist, but knew I wasn\u2019t good enough to have a successful career, so I went to Harvard thinking I would go into math or science. Once there, I wandered through literature and economics before majoring in social studies, an interdisciplinary program for indecisive people. I spent most of my time playing cello, which was not great for my grades but wonderful in itself. I fell in love with opera playing The Marriage of Figaro in a production conducted by Ben Loeb, and my life has been much better for it. In my junior year (as well as my sophomore and freshman years), I played in the Bach Society Orchestra, which was conducted by Alan Gilbert. One night we were wondering who would take over after Alan graduated and we decided that I should audition, which was the first I had ever thought of conducting. With a little coaching by Alan, I won the audition and spent my senior year as the orchestra\u2019s music director. Now, the funny thing about conducting is that because the technical standards are unclear\u2014the conductor never plays a note out of tune\u2014it\u2019s easy to think you are a better conductor than you actually are. So I decided I wanted to be a conductor, auditioned for the Curtis Institute of Music \u2014 and didn\u2019t get in. That\u2019s failure number one.\nInstead, I went to graduate school in history, which was my backup plan, and I went to Berkeley because it was the only school that offered me a fellowship. So moving to California, my favorite place that I have ever lived, was pretty much a complete accident. I spent my first few years mainly playing cello and studying conducting, until I once again failed to get into Curtis and finally gave that up. The plan of record was to become a history professor, but it turned out that I wasn\u2019t so good at original research. I was unable to get a decent academic job \u2014 although I didn\u2019t try that hard because my heart wasn\u2019t really in it \u2014 so that was failure number two.\nInstead, I got a job at McKinsey and Company as a management consultant \u2014 not so much because I wanted to go into the business world, but because it\u2019s one of the few companies that will give you a high-skill, high-pay, high-prestige job if you have a lot of education but no real job experience. In 1999, near the height of the Internet boom, I transferred from New York to the San Francisco office, not because I had any particular interest in the Internet, but because my wife needed to be in Berkeley to finish her Ph.D. More or less by accident, I wound up on a project at Ariba, then perhaps the hottest company in the \u201cbusiness to business e-commerce\u201d sector. The head of product marketing, Jon Corshen, offered me a job, probably because I worked hard and was good at PowerPoint. I took it, even though I had only the vaguest idea of what product marketing was, because Ariba seemed a lot more exciting than McKinsey.\nThen the Internet bubble crashed (twice), and Ariba became a less fun place to work. I remember my friends John Raguin and Marcus Ryu pitching me on the idea of starting a new company at a sushi restaurant in the Bellagio Hotel in Las Vegas, late one night at an Ariba \u201cuser group\u201d conference. (Another memory from that conference is watching Earth, Wind & Fire perform for a nearly empty house \u2014 this is post-bubble, remember.) I eventually agreed, largely because my wife had gotten a job at UMass Amherst and I had no idea what other job I could get in western Massachusetts. That worked out spectacularly well.\nSeveral years into that company, I started getting tired of the business world. I decided to go to law school in order to a public interest lawyer. (This is the blog post I wrote about that career change; you can see I was a better writer back then.) Just as school was beginning in the late summer of 2008, the financial crisis erupted. The day that the Troubled Asset Relief Program was announced, I had an idea for an article that needed to be written. I called Simon Johnson, who had recently left his job as chief economist of the IMF, and suggested that he write it. He cleverly suggested that we write it together. (I recall skipping torts class to do it.) After the Washington Post published the article, we had enough additional material to write something else for the Financial Times. Whenever I tell this story \u2014 which I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve done publicly \u2014 the next thing I say is, \u201cI thought I was done.\u201d But Simon had the idea to start a blog, which is how The Baseline Scenario was born. By January, we were hovering around a few hundred page views per day (I think, maybe a few thousand), and I was close to pulling the plug. But then Paul Krugman started linking to us, and Simon wrote a post about the \u201cAmerican oligarchs\u201d that got him on Bill Moyers, and then he was on This American Life, and we wrote an article for The Atlantic that got a million views back when that meant something, and we were in the big time. That led to 13 Bankers, which got a huge boost when the SEC sued Goldman and Bill Moyers invited both of us for one of his last shows.\nIn the meantime, I was still planning to become a public interest lawyer. I did one summer doing legal services in Springfield, Massachusetts, and another in the capital defender\u2019s office in Arlington, Virginia. But around the beginning of my third year, I decided for a variety of reasons that I would rather be a professor \u2014 so public interest lawyer wound up being another plan that didn\u2019t work out. Luckily for me, UConn \u2014 one of the two law schools within an hour\u2019s drive of my house \u2014 was hiring, and 13 Bankers got me the job (after the hiring committee\u2019s first choice turned it down). And that\u2019s how I became a professor.\nSo \u2026 is there a lesson in all that? As I said at the beginning, the things that I planned to do usually didn\u2019t happen; the most enjoyable and rewarding things I\u2019ve done began at least partly by accident. I ended up spending almost a decade at UConn, which is considerably longer than I lasted in any other job, and it would have been easy to stay there for two more decades. But part of me grew tired of doing the same thing year after year, and part of me \u2026 I don\u2019t know \u2026 longed for the next accident. I\u2019ve had so much fun doing so many different things that I didn\u2019t want to look up from my desk at the age of 70 and realize that I had spent more than half of my adult life doing the same thing. And instead of waiting until I had a brilliant idea about my next career, I decided to make myself available for whatever comes next.\nSo here I am. I\u2019m working on my next book, and I\u2019ve done some volunteer policy work for a political campaign. I\u2019m also playing in two freelancer orchestras, the New England Symphony Orchestra (next concert April 9 in Worcester) and the New England Repertory Orchestra (next concert April 27 in Worcester). If you have any ideas for what I should do next, feel free to suggest them\u2014as long as they aren\u2019t running for office or doing anything requires Senate confirmation. Those are right out.\nI\u2019m sorry this has been so self-indulgent, but I felt like I needed to explain myself, at least to my students. I\u2018m not sure there are any lessons you can take away from my experiences. Everyone\u2019s journey is unique, and I know I\u2019ve been extraordinarily fortunate in many ways. (I\u2019ve also been very unfortunate in some other ways, but, as my son says, we don\u2019t talk about that.) Anyone who promises you that things will work out is either a liar or a fool.

The hearing was also about private equity, but I focused on concentration among large asset management firms\u2014in particular, the economic power accrued by BlackRock, Vanguard, and (to a lesser extent) State Street because of their dominance in U. S. equity index funds. My written statement follows here.\nExecutive Summary\nIn recent decades, a few asset management firms have accumulated major ownership shares of virtually every large corporation in the economy. This development has had significant implications for the distribution of economic power in the United States.\nEconomic power is the power of individuals or organizations to determine how our economy functions. Today, economic power is concentrated in three types of entities: individual technology behemoths such as Amazon and Facebook; large private equity firms, which individually own more than two hundred companies; and giant asset management firms such as BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street (also known as the Big Three), which I focus on here.\nUnder state law, corporations are governed by their shareholders, who elect the board of directors and vote directly on certain issues. The Big Three control more than $20 trillion in assets, largely in mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that they manage on behalf of households and institutions. Many of these funds buy stock in corporations. Because these funds hold legal title to the stock, their managers generally have the power to vote the stock in corporate elections \u2014 even though the true economic owners are the investors in the funds.\nThe Big Three currently cast 25 percent of all votes cast in director elections for large corporations. This gives them significant influence over corporate directors and executives. The Big Three have been criticized for misusing this power in at least four different ways: (1) failing to adequately oversee corporations; (2) forcing a political agenda on companiess; (3) blocking shareholder efforts to make corporations address environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues; and (4) facilitating collusion among large players in the same industry.\nThe fundamental question, however, is not how these companies should use their power, but whether they should have it in the first place. In essence, economic power has been concentrated in the hands of the people who are best at administering and marketing low-cost index funds. Instead of shareholder capitalism, we have financial intermediary capitalism. Is this how we want our economy to be managed?\nWhat Is Economic Power?\nThe economy is the sum total of our productive activities and the mechanisms by which the things that we produce are distributed. Ordinary people primarily interact with the economy as consumers of goods and services and as workers in the labor market. Businesses interact with the economy as buyers and sellers of goods and services. Economic power is simply the power of different people or organizations to determine how things are produced and distributed: what products are made, where they are made, how they are made, how they are sold, and so on.\nThe United States has a largely capitalist economic system, in which economic decision-making is widely distributed. In such a system, economic power is mainly held by big corporations. Of course, the United States has an important small business sector. However, small businesses compete on a playing field that is largely determined by large corporations. For example, it is possible to create an innovative, profitable business selling small electronic accessories \u2014 but only if you can successfully market and sell your products on Amazon.\nHow Are Corporations Controlled?\nCorporations do not think for themselves \u2014 at least not yet. So the question of who holds economic power boils to the question of who controls large corporations. The governance of corporations is primarily a question of state corporate law. Most large corporations are incorporated in Delaware, but the basic rules are common to all states.\nIn principle, American corporations are governed by their shareholders. The primary justification for this system is that it is the shareholders who are directly affected by the economic fortunes of the corporation: shareholders are (indirectly) benefited by higher profits and harmed by lower profits. Lower profits also harm creditors and employees, among other stakeholders. In theory, however, because shareholders are the \u201cresidual\u201d claimants on the corporation \u2014 the ones who get whatever is left over after all the debts are paid \u2014 they have the incentive to maximize the value of the corporation, and therefore they should decide what it does.\nThings do not have to be this way. In a large German corporation, for example, workers have the right to select up to half of the members of the supervisory board. American shareholder primacy has been criticized for leading corporations to focus solely on maximizing profits, without concern for employees, customers, local communities, or the environment. At present, I simply want to note that it is widely believed in the American business community that corporations are and should be governed by their shareholders.\nIf a corporation has a majority shareholder, that person can make all the decisions for the corporation, or can hire a CEO who will follow their instructions. Most large corporations, however, do not have a majority shareholder. For them, shareholder governance works like this:\nShareholders vote directly on a small number of fundamental decisions, such as whether to merge the corporation into another entity, and on advisory resolutions. Shareholders also vote to elect members of the board of directors.\nThe board directly makes certain important decisions, such as whether to pay dividends. The board also hires and oversees the chief executive officer.\nThe CEO makes ordinary operational decisions along with the rest of the management team, which is hired by and responsible to the CEO.\nAs a result, even when there is no majority shareholder, shareholders can influence corporate directors and executives in three ways:\nBy voting out directors or by voting against management on other issues\nBy expressing their views to directors and executives, with the implicit threat of voting against them\nBy selling their stock, which can reduce the stock price\nIt is possible for a single minority shareholder to effectively control a corporation. For example, if one person owns 30 percent of a corporation\u2019s stock and no one else owns more than 2 percent, the person with a 30 percent stake is likely to be able to win any vote, especially given that many investors do not bother to vote their shares.\nEven when there is no controlling shareholder, corporate executives tend to be very attentive to the wishes of significant shareholders. They are concerned that major shareholders will sell their stock, lowering the share price; vote against the current board of directors; or support an activist hedge fund seeking to change the corporation\u2019s strategy or management.\nCongress has recognized the significant influence that minority shareholders can have over a corporation. Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act requires entities or groups holding more than 5 percent of the stock of a corporation to disclose their ownership publicly, in order to alert investors to potential changes in control. Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act classifies as insiders not only directors and officers but also holders of 10 percent of the stock of a corporation. Such insiders must report transactions in the corporation\u2019s stock and are barred from making profits on certain short-term price swings, on the grounds that they may be benefiting from their close relationship with the corporation.\nWho Controls Corporations?\nIf a single person owns a controlling block of stock in a corporation, they control the corporation. A few people wield considerable economic power because of their personal control of important companies, such as Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg, as did John D. Rockefeller in the nineteenth century. However, most large corporations are not controlled by a single person.\nA Little Bit of History\nTo simplify greatly, the United States economy has seen three general models of corporate governance in the past century. From roughly the 1930s to the 1970s, the ownership of large corporations was divided up among many individual shareholders, each with inconsequential ownership shares. In this model, described by scholars Adolf Berle and Gardiner Means, dispersed shareholders with small stakes have little incentive to even try to govern the corporation, leaving economic power in the hands of directors and executives.\nThe second half of the twentieth century saw the consolidation of assets among large institutional investors such as pension funds, mutual funds, hedge funds, and university endowments. Institutional investors amassed significant stakes in specific large corporations and began putting pressure on directors and executives to focus more closely on the stock price as the best measure of shareholder value. Corporate managers largely complied, in part because of a shift to compensation packages based on stock options, and in part because those who failed to increase their stock price were vulnerable to takeover in a merger wave that began in the 1980s. In this model, a corporation\u2019s decision-making is significantly influenced by a small number of institutional investors with large stakes in that corporation.\nThe past decade has seen the development of a new model of corporate control and hence a new allocation of economic power. A few asset management firms \u2014 led by BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street \u2014 have amassed significant ownership stakes in virtually every large corporation, which means that almost all corporations have the same major shareholders. Their influence over these corporations potentially gives them a breadth of economic power probably unrivaled since the age of J. P. Morgan at the beginning of the twentieth century.\nThis is not to say that these asset management firms are the only locus of economic power in today\u2019s economy. Amazon, for example, has tremendous power over the retail sector, shipping, publishing, and web services infrastructure, to name a few. Large private equity firms such as Blackstone, Carlyle, and KKR can each control more than 200 companies directly. Here, however, I want to focus on the specific issues presented by large asset management firms with concentrated stock ownership across the entire corporate sector.\nCorporate Control Today\nBlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street \u2014 sometimes known as the Big Three \u2014 have amassed their ownership positions largely because of a shift from actively-managed funds to index funds. Most individuals and institutions invest in stocks via mutual funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs). In an actively-managed fund, the fund manager attempts to beat the market by betting on individual stocks or industry sectors. In an index fund, the fund manager simply buys every stock in an index (such as the S&P 500), ensuring that the fund will do exactly as well as the market.\nSince index funds were introduced in the early 1970s, their share of total fund investments and of the total stock market has been increasing at an accelerating rate. In 2019, the amount of money in U.S. stock index funds exceeded the amount in actively-managed U.S. stock funds for the first time. The rise of index funds has generally been good for investors because (a) most actively-managed funds do worse than the market in most years, so index funds provide better returns on average, and (b) index funds have much lower costs because they are simple to administer. BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street are by far the three largest managers of stock index funds, with a combined 90 percent market share. This high concentration results from natural economies of scale in asset management and in index funds in particular: the larger the fund, the smaller its operating expenses are as a percentage of fund assets, which means lower fees for investors. From 2009 to 2018, the Big Three captured more than 80 percent of all net asset flows (inflows minus outflows) into all mutual funds and ETFs.\nThe Big Three offer actively-managed funds as well. At the end of 2021, BlackRock was the largest asset manager in the world, with more than $10 trillion in assets, while Vanguard had more than $8 trillion and State Street more than $4 trillion. More to the point, however, is their ownership share in large corporations. Although the money in a mutual fund or ETF is contributed by outside investors, the fund itself has legal title to the shares it holds and therefore the right to vote those shares (absent a side agreement with the investors). As of 2019, BlackRock\u2019s median ownership stake of S&P 500 corporations was 7.4 percent; that is, BlackRock owned more than 7.4 percent of half of the companies in the index and less than 7.4 percent of the other half. Vanguard\u2019s and State Street\u2019s median ownership percentages were 9.5 percent and 4.5 percent, respectively. In 2017, the Big Three together cast more than one-quarter of all votes in director elections for S&P 500 companies. In aggregate, their median ownership stake in S&P 500 companies in 2019 was more than three times as large as in 2000.\nConsequences\nWhat is novel about this situation is that the Big Three own significant shares of not just some corporations, but virtually all large corporations. Traditionally, a large investor would have a major ownership stake in a relatively limited number of companies and would therefore have a vested interest in their success. Because the Big Three own similar proportions of every large corporation, they have different incentives.\nDifferent commentators have made at least four major critiques of how the Big Three use their economic power. All four critiques cannot be valid in the same context at the same time \u2014 at times the Big Three have been criticized for doing one thing and for doing its opposite \u2014 but all four could be valid to differing degrees in different contexts.\n(In addition to these four critiques of the economic power of the Big Three, there is also evidence that excessive concentration in the asset management industry can create risks to financial stability. That is a separate topic that I will not pursue here.)\n1. Failure to Govern\nThe Big Three may pay too little attention to corporate governance issues, allowing corporate managers to ignore the interests of their shareholders. A large proportion of their assets are held in index funds, and index funds do not compete based on returns (because all funds tracking the same index have virtually the same returns), so the fund management companies have little incentive to oversee the companies they invest in. Because index funds compete on cost, there is a disincentive to invest in corporate governance. As of 2016, the Big Three together employed only about fifty people dedicated to governance issues. In addition, asset management firms may defer to corporate managers because they earn revenues from managing the assets in those corporations\u2019 retirement plans. Indeed, the Big Three vote according to the recommendations of the board of directors more than 90 percent of the time; they are even more likely to vote with management against proposals initiated by outside shareholders.\n2. Forcing Political Views on Corporations\nIn recent years, the Big Three have become sensitive to this criticism, and they now insist that they take their corporate governance responsibilities seriously. Vanguard founder John Bogle claimed, \u201cwe are the invisible hand of the marketplace,\u201d and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink regularly exhorts corporate executives to take climate change more seriously. All three companies advertise their oversight efforts loudly, particularly their attention to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues. As a result, some observers argue that the Big Three are using their power to advance the political agendas of their CEOs instead of focusing on maximizing shareholder value.\n3. Blocking Progress on ESG Issues\nAt the same time, other people criticize the Big Three for not using their economic power to improve society, in particular for opposing ESG-related proposals. Of the top 25 asset management firms in 2019, BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street were among the most likely to vote against shareholder proposals addressing climate risks, political and lobbying activities by fossil fuel companies, and governance reforms at fossil fuel companies. All three voted for management-recommended directors of fossil fuel companies at least 99 percent of the time. (BlackRock increased its support for climate-related proposals in 2021, but still rarely votes against directors.) BlackRock and Vanguard also vote overwhelmingly against proposals that require corporations to disclose their political spending activities.\nObviously critiques 2 and 3 cannot both be valid in the same context, but they demonstrate the influence of these asset management companies.\n4. Anti-Competitive Behavior\nThe Big Three may facilitate tacit collusion among large corporations in the same industry. The Big Three own stock in all of the large companies in any industry, and they could use their influence to encourage collusive policies that increase the aggregate profits of those companies but harm customers and employees. Economic studies have found that common ownership of nominal competitors by asset management firms produces higher prices in both the airline and retail banking industries. While there is no smoking-gun evidence of asset management firms encouraging price-fixing, corporate executives are certainly aware of the interests of their major shareholders and could adopt anti-competitive policies to make those shareholders happy.\nThe Special Case of BlackRock\nBlackRock has also accumulated additional power through its interactions with the federal government. BlackRock is so important a player in the securities markets that it has been hired by the Federal Reserve to implement several of its programs. During the 2008 financial crisis, BlackRock was selected to manage mortgage assets previously held by Bear Stearns and AIG. During the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, BlackRock was hired to execute the Federal Reserve\u2019s purchases of mortgage-backed securities and corporate bonds and ETFs, which put BlackRock in the position of buying its own ETFs for the Federal Reserve\u2019s account. BlackRock executives have frequent contacts with senior government officials in both Republican and Democratic administrations. Larry Fink was widely considered a serious contender to become treasury secretary if Hillary Clinton won the 2016 presidential election. The firm\u2019s political influence no doubt contributes to its economic power.\nThe Accidental Oligopoly\nThe best argument for American shareholder capitalism \u2014 in which shareholders govern the corporations that shape our economy \u2014 is that the owners of a company should get to decide what it does. The system may not be ideal, but the underlying justification is that the people whose money is at risk get to call the shots.\nThis is no longer the case. The people increasingly calling the shots in the American economy are a handful of executives of a handful of asset management firms who are playing with enormous amounts of other people\u2019s money that they accumulated by being very good at administering, marketing, and selling index funds. Instead of shareholder governance, we have financial intermediary governance. These intermediaries gained economic power because of a massive swing in investor sentiment away from actively-managed funds and toward index funds. Their executives are highly capable businesspeople, but they are increasingly becoming the unelected stewards of the American economy. (People buy index funds and ETFs from a given asset manager either because they have no other choice in their retirement plan or because of cost \u2014 not because they like how that asset manager votes its shares.) In the words of law professor John Coates, \u201cA small number of unelected agents, operating largely behind closed doors, are increasingly important to the lives of millions who barely know of the existence much less the identity or inclinations of those agents.\u201d\nTake the example of climate change. Some people think that asset managers should not take a position on climate issues. Others think that they should actively push corporations to reduce their carbon footprints. But the more fundamental question is: Why do the CEOs of the Big Three, assisted by a few dozen analysts, have the swing vote on crucial questions that affect our economy and society? Do we want corporate America\u2019s attitude to climate change to depend on whether three people happen to be Republicans or Democrats? This is obviously not a democratic system. But it is not really a capitalist system, either. Corporate control is in the hands not of the people whose money is at stake \u2014 the investors in mutual funds and ETFs \u2014 but of the executives who manage the companies that manage those mutual funds and ETFs.\nWe are not yet at the point where Larry Fink can dictate terms to any corporation in the S&P 500, but the CEO of almost every large corporation has to listen to Larry Fink and take his views seriously. This problem is not going to solve itself. Each year, the Big Three\u2019s aggregate ownership share of the typical S&P 500 company grows by about one percentage point. This trend is unlikely to change anytime soon because the shift to index funds is actually good for investors as individuals. I hope that Republicans and Democrats can agree that this increasing concentration of economic power by a few asset management firms is not good for our economy or our country, even if we may disagree on what to do about it.", "comment_count": 2, "like_count": 133, "created_time": 1645459972238, "comment": [{"user_id": "5a457150d7a6", "comment_time": 1645459972238, "comment": "Thank you for sharing!"}, {"user_id": "46143b2857b6", "comment_time": 1645584240076, "comment": "So, will you honestly and logically address the inevitable and most likely effects of including each human being on the planet equally in a globally standard process of money creation?\n\nFiat money's an option to purchase human labor/produce/property, and we don't get paid our option fees.\n\nFunctionally, there's nothing else to do with it, trade with\u2026"}, {"user_id": "3cc0c4ca25b7", "comment_time": 1645543027214, "comment": "Not so \"accidental\" perhaps."}], "post_tag": ["Blackrock", "Asset Management", "Corporate Governance", "Economics", "Oligopoly"]}, {"author": "James Kwak", "post_id": "34465bd39348", "user_id": "5a457150d7a6", "title": "Why Democracy Is Dying", "content": "Why Democracy Is Dying\nPhoto by Ka\u010dka a Ondra (CC BY 2.0)\nNot enough people care.\nIn The New York Times this week, David Leonhardt suggested that the only hope for democracy may be a \u201cconservative-liberal alliance.\u201d Specifically, he quotes political scientist Steven Levitsky\u2019s proposal for a 2024 \u201cfusion ticket\u201d combining the Democratic Party with anti-Trump Republicans; think Joe Biden running with Liz Cheney as his vice-presidential nominee.\nOn its face, this is not a crazy idea. I have argued for years that progressive Democrats should not compromise with moderates, let alone conservative Republicans\u2014that the path to political victory and to a better society begins with an undiluted focus on the economic welfare of ordinary people. Today, however, our top priority has to be protecting democracy from Donald Trump and his followers. (If you don\u2019t believe me, please read Barton Gellman\u2019s analysis.) Unchecked economic inequality certainly helped make Trumpism possible. But even the most enlightened economic policies, enacted today, would be unable to reverse the tide of inequality in time for the 2024 election.\nThis means we need to look for political solutions to the threat of authoritarianism, and a fusion ticket is a plausible one. But I fear that rallying people around \u201cdemocracy\u201d will be a losing cause.\nTo begin with, it\u2019s important to realize that the most likely scenario is not that American democracy is overthrown by a mob assault on the Capitol. Neither the Pentagon nor even this Supreme Court would uphold that outcome. Instead, the coup will occur under cover of procedural legality. Republican state legislatures\u2014operating under the well-established principles that states have primary responsibility for elections and that the legislature determines how presidential electors are chosen\u2014are already passing laws giving them the power to intervene at key points in the voting process. In Georgia, for example, Barton Gellman explains:\na GOP-dominated state board, beholden to the legislature, may overrule and take control of voting tallies in any jurisdiction \u2026 The State Election Board can suspend a county board if it deems the board to be \u201cunderperforming\u201d and replace it with a handpicked administrator. The administrator, in turn, will have final say on disqualifying voters and declaring ballots null and void.\nWe know that plenty of Trump-dominated state legislatures wanted to overturn the 2020 election results; consider the subsequent embarrassing behavior of the Arizona legislature, for example. Now they have the tools. The Trump social media machine will generate unsubstantiated allegations of voting irregularities; local election boards will, correctly, dismiss those allegations; state legislatures or their proxies will overrule those local election boards and either count the votes the way they want to or throw the outcome to the legislature, which will select Trump\u2019s slate for the Electoral College.\nThe key question is \u2026 who cares?\nObviously people care about the outcome of any particular election. But the number of Democrats who fear that Republican election legislation will help Donald Trump win the 2024 election is not enough to stop it from happening. The future of our political system depends on whether enough people care about democracy as a political system in itself. I care, and, if you are still reading this, you probably care, too. But I would suggest that there are not very many of us.\nOf course, if you ask Americans if they are in favor of \u201cdemocracy,\u201d well over 90 percent will say \u201cyes.\u201d The important question, however, is whether they value the proper functioning of democracy more than their preferred set of political outcomes: whether, for example, a liberal would give up progress on climate change, or a conservative would agree to abortion rights, in exchange for fair elections. Many people would probably say they would take that deal. In practice, I doubt it.\nFirst of all, a significant proportion of Americans\u2014perhaps about one-third\u2014already think that democracy is broken. If, as they believe, the 2020 election was fraudulent, Republican measures to lock up the next election are actually a good thing.\nMore generally, public confidence in our governmental institutions is\u2014justifiably\u2014at historic lows. The legitimacy of a political system is based on its ability to protect and enhance the basic welfare of its members. By any objective measure, ours is not doing the job. The economic struggles of ordinary Americans in our age of extreme inequality are well documented. We fought two disastrous wars that killed hundreds of thousands of people while undermining our position in the world. Our action on climate change amounts to, in the words of Greta Thunberg, \u201cBlah, blah, blah.\u201d Eight hundred thousand Americans have died of COVID-19. In this context, people still have political preferences, but their allegiance to the political system\u2014which many on the right and the left see as broken\u2014is far weaker.\nLarge blocks of the population probably don\u2019t think that authoritarianism would be significantly worse for them and their families. The stereotypical white working-class family has gotten the short end of the economic stick for decades; it\u2019s unfair to expect them to cherish the electoral mechanisms that select politicians who ignore their interests. The stereotypical white, suburban middle-class family doesn\u2019t expect to be a target of Trumpist mobs. The corporate elite and the very rich assume\u2014probably rightly\u2014that any future political system will protect the prerogatives of big business and wealth.\nWho stands to lose most from right-wing, Gospel-thumping, white authoritarianism? Jews. Muslims. Other non-Christians. Ethnic minorities. Gay and transgender people. Journalists. University professors who value academic freedom. Over-educated intellectuals. Even within those groups, the number of people for whom democracy outweighs their other priorities as a voting issue is small. As we\u2019ve seen in many ages of history and in other parts of the globe today, this isn\u2019t much of a coalition.\nCertainly there are many people who don\u2019t want Donald Trump to be president again. As things currently stand, however, they aren\u2019t going to be enough to stop him\u2014because of the Republican thumb on the scales in many swing states. My point is that there also aren\u2019t very many people willing to make a stand for democracy itself.\nAnd, let\u2019s face it, most of them are already Democrats. An alliance with Liz Cheney and Mitt Romney would require a deal to do essentially nothing on any substantive issue of consequence\u2014climate change, abortion rights, health care, gun control, universal preschool, free college, judicial nominations, you name it\u2014in order to beat back Trumpism for four years. I personally might take that deal, but I think sacrificing every other issue that Democratic voters care about would be a net loser at the ballot box. (This also leaves aside the uncomfortable fact that both Cheney and Romney actually oppose meaningful voting rights; they seem to have a problem with Trump the man, not with their party\u2019s efforts to undermine democracy.)\nTo sum up: Our country suffers from deep problems, chief among them inequality, racism, and climate change. We cannot solve any of them unless we preserve our democratic institutions. But democracy itself is under assault. The last presidential election whose outcome reflected the will of the voters may already have happened. People who spend a lot of time on Twitter think that the threat to democracy is self-evident and that Americans will rally to its defense because \u2026 democracy.

Photo: Jim Watson/Getty Images\nBy Janani Mohan\nAs a child of the 2000s, I can\u2019t remember a time when America was not at war. I grew up thinking that conflict in Iraq and Afghanistan was the norm. I\u2019d see photos of the war heroes from my hometown who died in the Middle East. And while I\u2019m too young to remember 9/11, many people around me still felt it deeply. That may help explain why in 2004, during the first election I can remember, a president who was tanking the economy and violating human rights still won.\nAmerica has always had a certain recipe for winning elections: Start a war. Blame the adversary. Throw in some \u201cdecisive strikes.\u201d James Madison won reelection during the War of 1812, and since then, presidents have never lost their reelection campaigns during wartime (Lyndon Johnson did decline to run for a second term because of the unpopularity of Vietnam). And despite a failing economy and his approval rating on a downward trend, President George W. Bush won a second term in 2004 at the height of the Iraq and Afghanistan Wars.\nOf course, President Donald Trump himself is aware of this recipe. In the lead-up to the 2012 elections, he tweeted:\n\nNow, here we are in 2020, it\u2019s Trump\u2019s year to vie for reelection, and guess which country he\u2019s starting a war with? Iran.\nQuick review: Just before the start of the new decade, Iranian militiamen laid siege to the U.S. embassy in Baghdad to protest U.S. airstrikes that killed 25 of their fighters earlier in the week. The U.S. Army responded by firing tear gas to disburse the crowd. And then on Thursday, Trump ordered a drone strike on the Baghdad airport targeting and killing Iranian military leader Qassem Soleimani and eight others. Iran has naturally vowed revenge, and the surrounding Middle East is on high alert.\nI am no longer that child brought up during the height of war. I\u2019ve since worked for several federal agencies and spent years extensively researching international law and politics. And I have seen firsthand the administrative state fall apart during the Trump regime.\nBased on this experience, I know how key populated areas in the U.S. are taking extra precautions to avert potential terrorist attacks. And because Iran is a state-actor far more well-funded than ISIS or Al Qaeda, it raises concerns that our leaders may be targeted or that biological and chemical weapons will be used. Israel is vigilant of potential threats. And as a nuclear policy expert, I am particularly terrified of Iran escalating the nuclear arms race, increasing volatility in an already volatile Middle East.\nThis entire situation is a huge mistake. There\u2019s a reason why previous administrations did not take out Soleimani, monster that he was. When Gen. Stanley McChrystal had the chance to attack Soleimani\u2019s convoy in 2007, he didn\u2019t, explaining that restraint is a strength of the U.S. political system. Soleimani wasn\u2019t currently attacking the U.S. or American interests, and the U.S. has tried to broker a hesitant peace in the Middle East for years. As one Iraqi official said, this is \u201cthe mother of all escalations.\u201d So it was shocking to see not only that America claimed such quick credit for the attacks, but that Trump released his official statement from Mar-a-Lago, where he spends taxpayer money to stay at his own resorts.\nBut while the war recipe has worked for presidents before Trump, it won\u2019t work this time. War won\u2019t propel Trump to victory in 2020.\nThe circumstances are far more unique this time around. After major wars end, presidents aren\u2019t as likely to receive a boost from starting new ones. Following the American Civil War, Andrew Johnson was impeached, and subsequent smaller-scale wars, including ones with Native Americans and Japan, did not help him reach a second term. This holds true for a majority of the presidents who did not win reelection. They were running during more peaceful times between wars, similar in some ways to the current period.\nTrump\u2019s warmongering is going to backfire. It\u2019s not going to benefit his campaign.\nWhile wars have historically galvanized conservatives to turn out and vote, Trump would also likely face outsized opposition from young people. Youth turnout jumped during the Vietnam War, for example, because young people notoriously vote to protest against controversial conflict. And though millennials failed to turn out at high rates in 2016, a potential war with Iran may be enough to motivate them to the polls. After all, young voters tend to heavily favor Democratic candidates; in 2016, 55% of us voted for Hillary Clinton as opposed to only 37% for Trump.\nIt\u2019s not just youth. The vast majority of Americans prefer diplomatically negotiating with Iran over taking military action, even among Republicans. And, of course, there\u2019s the simple truth that we are sick and tired of being at war. A survey of Americans last year found that 86% of Americans believe that military action should be a last resort; 71% want Congress to constrain military actions. Meanwhile, the majority believe that military action should be limited. This is notable considering that Trump didn\u2019t even consult Congress before this strike.\nTrump\u2019s warmongering is going to backfire. It\u2019s not going to benefit his campaign. All the old war recipe is going to do is destabilize the world.\nToday, as I sit here shocked, I remember that this is my first presidential election since turning 18. I\u2019m ready to try a new election recipe that isn\u2019t just about conflict. I\u2019m ready to live in an America that isn\u2019t permanently deployed. It\u2019s time for us to stand up for a leader who will maintain global stability instead of one who warmongers to win elections.", "comment_count": 4, "like_count": 581, "created_time": 1578069332492, "comment": [{"user_id": "b550367cdd3b", "comment_time": 1578069332492, "comment": "Thank you for sharing!"}, {"user_id": "6f6a58372b2b", "comment_time": 1578392756013, "comment": "There was a draft in the 1960s."}, {"user_id": "24c60eee41aa", "comment_time": 1578328370520, "comment": "No, this will not save him.

But after tonight\u2019s horrifying news that the Supreme Court is about to overturn Roe vs. Wade, I am publishing it again. Although this story is behind the paywall, consider this permission to copy the text and spread it around as much as you want. (Do credit me, please.)\nI am standing in abject horror in the shards of our democracy tonight.\nThe majority of the country supports abortion rights. There is no science to show that fetuses at the time of early-term abortion feel meaningful pain or are sentient. (Certainly not as sentient as cows, pigs, or chickens we slaughter in the fucking billions \u2014 and though I shy away from writing about this, for the record, Republicans are at fault for the fact many of them are gutted or bled out alive.) Texas today has fewer abortion rights than the Taliban and the Supreme Court is cool with that. We are regressing decades of women\u2019s rights among cries from the right-wing that women shouldn\u2019t vote, rape babies are a gift from God, and it\u2019s okay to grab us by the pussy (no cite needed for common knowledge).\nThe Supreme Court is so Republican that even if the Republican Chief Justice Roberts dissents, the 5\u20134 decision will cripple the rights of millions of women. Meanwhile, Republican Congressmen will continue to get their mistresses abortions and celebrate rapists like Brett Kavanaugh and Clarence Thomas.\nWe have such a flawed democracy that Mitch McConnell \u2014 a contender for the worst human being alive \u2014 refused to confirm Democratic nominee Merrick Garland in March of 2016 because it was too close to the election and then confirmed Republican joke Amy Coney Barrett in October of 2020. We had a fucking insurrection by the right where they flew the fucking Confederate flag over our Capitol building and locked down the city I lived in for months.\n(And don\u2019t tell me to stop using the word \u201cfucking\u201d when this is very much what tonight is about.)\nThis decision showcases what is wrong with this country today:\nIt is racist. Minority women are disproportionately likely to need an abortion, have a lack of access to contraceptives, and are not able to afford to just leave the state and get an abortion.\nIt is sexist. This is fucking obvious. If you really care about unwanted pregnancy, require all men to get reversible vasectomies. If you really care about children, support child rights and increase support to low-income families. If you really care about preventing abortion, support contraception. But let\u2019s be clear, it was never about any of that. It has always been \u2014 and will always be \u2014 about controlling women.\nIt is involuntary servitude. If you want a woman to keep a child she doesn\u2019t want, pay her for carrying it and see if she agrees.\nIt is undemocratic. The majority of Americans support abortion rights. (Most importantly, the majority of people with uteruses do.) The Supreme Court should look like America, but it doesn\u2019t. It should have more Democrat-nominated justices, but Mitch McConnell doesn\u2019t believe in democracy. The Senate is undemocratic, which is how he came to be an all-powerful jerk. The Constitution was supposed to protect minorities from majoritarian states imposing their dictatorial views on a disenfranchised minority. Heck, that was the specific point of the Supreme Court. But here we are.\nMost of all, it is forcing the views of white Christian men on the rest of us. As a Hindu, I was taught young by my hyper-religious aunt that a human baby does not have a soul until it is born. My family never said there was anything immoral or wrong about having an abortion \u2014 not once. Not because they aren\u2019t conservative in other ways, but because all religions do not believe the bullshit Christians do. What right do Christian people have to ignore science and impose their stupid fundamentalist views on my Hindu atheist body? Abortion bans are frankly a ruthless violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment that states the government cannot support one religion over others. I\u2019d argue the bans are violations of a lot of other amendments too \u2014 the Fourteenth, the Eighth, the Third (ask me about it, it\u2019s a funny theory), three other parts of the First \u2014 but hey, I\u2019m not as morally bankrupt as Justice Alito.\nThis is unfair. This is a disaster. This is a crying shame for all Americans.\nWe do not have required paid parental leave in this country. Why do we have required pregnancy?\nTonight, if you\u2019re one of the bloody assholes who is celebrating, consider this. You are lucky. You are lucky to have never needed an abortion.\nAnd here, once again, are ten reasons why you may have never needed one, none of which you get to take credit for:\n1. You do not have a uterus.\nEnough said. No uterus, no right to ban abortion. Sometimes my female friends and I joke about force-sterilizing men and then we remember that we\u2019d never be able to control their bodies. And you don\u2019t get to control ours.\n2. You can afford birth control that is effective.\nBirth control is expensive, whether it\u2019s pills, implants, or IUDs, and it\u2019s far more expensive for women than men. Because of blatant sexism, male birth control is rarely researched or approved and many men don\u2019t want to take pills with side effects. (Female contraceptives have side effects too, but people care less about women.) And then most men don\u2019t split the costs for their female partner\u2019s birth control.\n3. You have had sex \u2014 maybe even a lot of sex \u2014 and the condom hasn\u2019t broken.\nCondoms break. Sometimes people get pregnant without even having penetrative sex. Evolution had one job, so it\u2019s a lot easier than we\u2019d like to get pregnant.\n4. You are not allergic to birth control.\nMany of my friends are. What do you want them to do? Right, use condoms (assuming you don\u2019t have a latex allergy). But they can break and men can refuse to put them on correctly. Yippee.\n5. The morning-after pill worked.\nIt sometimes doesn\u2019t.\n6. You had unsafe sex and got lucky.\n65.5% of Americans have had unprotected sex. Pulling out as a method of (ineffective) birth control is on the rise for women who don\u2019t like birth control and men who don\u2019t like condoms. Yet 65.5% of Americans have not had an abortion. Y\u2019all are just lucky.\n7. You haven\u2019t been raped.\nI\u2019m not even touching this one. If you\u2019re pro-life even in the event a woman gets raped, you are an indefensible moron. (I\u2019ve upgraded my rage since last year.)\n8. You got pregnant and could afford to keep the child \u2014 or give it to someone else.\nHere\u2019s your daily reminder that there are millions of Americans living paycheck to paycheck, millions of children who never get adopted out of foster care, and millions of people who can barely afford the lives they have right now.\nAlso, pregnancy is expensive. Tons of women can\u2019t afford pre-and post-natal care, diapers, or even the time off work. We do not have required paid parental leave in this country. Why do we have required pregnancy?\n9. You got pregnant and had a family structure and job that allowed you to keep the child.\nIt\u2019s not only about the money. Raising a child on one\u2019s own is hard. It\u2019s nearly impossible. There are plenty of jobs that make it very difficult for women to have children. Having a child too young could cripple our careers, job prospects, and dating life. That\u2019s not your decision to make for us.\n10. You got pregnant and were healthy enough to keep the child.\nPregnancy is a huge risk. It is still very unsafe, very painful, and could go horribly wrong. We don\u2019t research into women\u2019s health anywhere close to as much as we should and I know several women whose bodies never recovered from having a baby. It shouldn\u2019t be up to incompetent doctors who take an average of seven years to diagnose serious gynecological issues like endometriosis to decide whether we think our bodies are able to produce human beings.\nToday, I dream of a world where not only all people with uteruses can get an abortion, but there isn\u2019t any stigma either. No judgment from friends and family. No judgment online.\nFor those of you who don\u2019t understand why so many women make the choice to get an abortion, I challenge you to look within yourself and confront your worldview. Or because I think you\u2019re a shitty person, maybe I should pass some laws to have other people force your body to do things. No more cancer treatment for people who Hindu atheist women think are immoral. That would be fun.\nPenalizing women for wanting to have sex is crazy. Abortion isn\u2019t the first choice for anyone. People do try to have safe sex. Sometimes things happen anyway.\nAnd for a country that wants to keep the government out of homes, guns, schools, and even international companies, for God\u2019s sake, why are we letting them into our bodies?\nLet us live how we want. Enough is fucking enough.\n\u2014 x \u2014\n*Note: I apologize for saying \u201cwomen\u201d or \u201cfemale\u201d when I mean \u201cpeople with uteruses.\u201d It got really difficult to say \u201cpeople with uteruses\u201d every single time in this piece and a lot of abortion rights is tied into feminism. But to be clear, men and nonbinary people can get pregnant too and their rights matter exactly as much as cis women\u2019s rights do. I hope we settle on a term for \u201cpeople with uteruses\u201d soon and then I\u2019ll use that. If you know a better way to have handled this, please tell me in the comments.

I swore I was never going to write an article like this. But if something genuinely succeeds on the mystery that is social media and if I learn something valuable, I am going to share the heck out of it. (As an aside, an influencer friend told me not to share. Apparently, we can\u2019t afford more competition on LinkedIn. But I say as long as you\u2019re using social media for good, compete away. Outdo me. I\u2019m rooting for you.)\nAnyway, here\u2019s the story.\nLast Wednesday, after much waffling and graphic design, I launched the Do Good, Be Happy newsletter on LinkedIn. It was automatically shared with my three hundred thousand followers on the platform \u2014 or, at least, those who haven\u2019t toggled off newsletter pings. I think the phrasing on LinkedIn\u2019s automatic notification is something like \u201cIsvari Maranwe invites you to join her newsletter,\u201d which is a very nice and personal touch.\nWithin twenty-four hours, about eleven thousand people had voluntarily signed up (or accidentally clicked subscribe, I don\u2019t know). Several people messaged me and seemed genuinely excited for my weekly content. And hundreds of people liked my first article, a summary of my raison d\u2019\u00eatre that I wrote in a few hours by combining bits and pieces of my best Medium works.\nThis turned out to be the easiest 11K subscribers in the history of my haphazard social media presence. A part of it is that I have an offbeat brand and publish counterculture content, and about one in thirty of my followers liked me enough to hit subscribe in a single day. But even if you\u2019re in a competitive field and don\u2019t have the 300K followers to start with, you can absolutely copy the elements that led to my success.\nHere are the six basic things I learned during this crazy experience, beyond the value of a newsletter on LinkedIn. (Of course, you can stop here if you just want to know how I did it and go create your own newsletter.)\nThe bigger point is that you need to be unashamed of taking the opportunities that work for you on social media and be creative in how you push your stuff out there.\n1. Don\u2019t be evil and don\u2019t be an asshole.\nA lot of people with a lot of subscribers are either evil, an asshole, or both. But if you fall into those categories, I don\u2019t give you permission to use any of these tips. Go away. Don\u2019t make social media any worse than it already is.\nAs long as you have something positive to share with the world, you aren\u2019t promoting toxicity, and you have a brand or product that increases happiness or productivity, then you\u2019re fine. Think of social media as a necessary evil of doing that good thing. If you keep your final (good) goal in mind, then you won\u2019t fall prey to tempting ways to increase followers that actually cause harm in the long term. All publicity is not good publicity.\n2. Figure out what people want you to say on which platforms and write only that.\nI don\u2019t post about cops on LinkedIn because those posts do not change anyone\u2019s minds and I do not like receiving rape and death threats. If I want to support Black Lives Matter on LinkedIn, I\u2019m better off elevating Black content creators, commenting on their posts, and talking about diversity and inclusion in the workplace. Congratulating Justice Jackson? Yes. Arguing for defunding the police force? Not unless you want your account flagged. (I\u2019m not a fan of LinkedIn\u2019s content control team.)\nLearning those boundaries on each platform is extremely helpful. LinkedIn likes story text posts and regular Instagram-like photos, but only if you\u2019re a woman. TikTok creators use specific \u201cvoices\u201d for specific types of content. The YouTube algorithm likes 15-minute vlogs with a catchphrase in your outro. The more you watch and read the type of content you want to create, the better you\u2019ll do.\n3. Follow people who are successful, whether you like them or not.\nRelated to the last point, find people who are insanely successful in a similar niche to your content market and follow them. You do not need to like or support their content if you don\u2019t agree with them or secretly think they\u2019re horrible people. But even horrible people can share a gem or two sometimes, and these people are at the top for a reason, even if it\u2019s a bad one.\n4. Strike while the iron is hot \u2014 do what the platforms want you to do.\nThis is the single most important tip that I have. The reason my newsletter did so well on LinkedIn and the reason I set it up in the first place is because it was the only way to ping all of my 300K followers. I used to be an influencer on the platform about seven years ago. And then I stopped. I hated it and I hated social media. Now, because I\u2019m the President of an international nonprofit, I\u2019m forced to go back and stay on top of it. But my engagement on the platform is dismal because I haven\u2019t posted in years.\nWhen I learned how much LinkedIn wants their newsletters to succeed, I realized they\u2019d be promoting the heck out of them. So I created one. The same was once true of their stories (now dead), their articles ten years ago, and LinkedIn Live (still there, haven\u2019t tried it yet).\nKeep up with the blogs written by platforms and if an opportunity arises to be an early adopter of a new feature, jump on it.\n5. Keep it as easy as possible.\nI am not ashamed to admit I\u2019m going to be repurposing Medium content for my newsletter. There is no way I have time to stay on top of multiple IG and TikTok accounts, YouTube, two Medium articles, a LinkedIn newsletter, etc. etc. every week. It\u2019s just too much, especially for someone who doesn\u2019t like it and works sixty hours a week on other things.\nSo I plan to repost my TikTok content to Instagram. I repurpose Medium content for LinkedIn. I write posts on my phone in two minutes and just hit post.\nThe only thing I take anywhere close to seriously is this platform, even though I have way fewer followers here. That\u2019s because I genuinely love writing and would have been a full-time writer in another life. It\u2019s also why if I\u2019m not promoting Dweebs Global, I\u2019m linking people to subscribe here. It\u2019s okay to prioritize.\n6. Meet the gods of social media.\nThis, the last step, happens when you\u2019re really lucky and you catch the eye of a platform deity \u2014 basically, a LinkedIn or YouTube or Medium (in the old days when they had editors) or Clubhouse employee. They\u2019ll have titles with the words \u201cContent\u201d or \u201cManager\u201d or \u201cEditor\u201d in them. They\u2019re the people who are watching trends, discovering new talent to help promote, and finding creators to give financial bonuses to. They know what the algorithms are.\nBack in the day, one of the reasons I succeeded on LinkedIn is because I was a \u201cLinkedIn Campus Editor\u201d and I\u2019d been active on the platform since I was a young teenager. Many of their senior content folks knew who I was. One of the reasons I stopped succeeding is because I ended up pissing one of them off when I refused to edit an article the way they wanted.\nWhen you find the gods, don\u2019t piss them off.\nAfter the initial success of my newsletter, I\u2019m excited to see where things go next. Is there a way to successfully convince some of those subscribers to check me out on Medium? Is there a way to convert a high newsletter following into more engagement with my posts? Are people going to meaningfully interact with what I write?\nAnd, of course: am I ever going to be satisfied? You\u2019d think with 11K subscribers in a day, I\u2019d be jumping for joy. It turns out that if you\u2019re the sort of person who jumps for joy, you appreciate the small things. If you\u2019re the sort of person who is used to self-deprecating and making everything seem like a small deal (perks of being bullied your whole life), then 11K is a box to check and you feel sad you didn\u2019t hit 15 or 30 or 100K.\nSo make sure to appreciate the small things \u2014 every one of the new followers and subscribers and successes you get. Make sure you\u2019re using your social media presence to spread happiness and joy, instead of toxic hustle culture or just promoting your brand. And make sure to have time off from the likes and comments to breathe deeply and remember what matters.\nCheck out some of my other articles on social media:\nTikTok Challenges Can Destroy Relationships\nPSA: Be careful with which ones you trymedium.com\nDon\u2019t Be An Influencer.

I can\u2019t imagine myself without my husband, darling, light of my life, etc. because I love talking to him, I feel completely safe with him, and we have built an interwoven tapestry of a life together.\nBut also, if I\u2019m being honest, it\u2019s because I don\u2019t want to handle my own taxes.\nWhile I did get married for love, I didn\u2019t stay married for love. This is not because my husband and I have been through a torrid season of separation, but because while we have stayed in love, we would not have been able to stay together if we weren\u2019t also similar people possessing similar sensibilities and desires in life and having the strength and smarts to work out some thorny situations we were both thrust in. Basically, we wouldn\u2019t have stayed married if we hadn\u2019t gotten married and been the sort of people who did.\nPracticality. Bureaucratic necessity. The real world. These are three things that will rear their ugly unromantic heads into even the most beautiful of relationships.\nAnd historically speaking, marriage was about these things. What\u2019s wrong with that? Finding someone you can live with is far more important than finding someone you don\u2019t want to live without. I think the world would be a much better place if more people realized that and coupled up accordingly.\nHere are ten of my strongest reasons on why I think people should get married that have nothing to do with falling in love:\n1. Households are difficult to manage with one person.\nI do not know how people cook, clean, manage all their finances, and wait for an hour on hold with Comcast all on their own. It\u2019s just too much. Do you never take a break? Are you one of those people with an actual nine-to-five job? I may never know, but I do know that I could never. When I lived alone, there was spoiled rice in my fridge for three months and my dad handled everything from my car to my bank account.\nAnd that\u2019s even without having kids. Which brings me to:\n2. Children are difficult to raise alone.\nIt\u2019s old-fashioned and trite \u2014 and I mean absolutely no insult to the wizards who are single parents \u2014 but children were meant to be raised by a village. Even two parents aren\u2019t enough. Mothers and fathers need breaks. Nights off. Someone to rely on. I know a lot of people who got married because they wanted kids and needed the support to do so. Most of them are happy.\n3. Life is cheaper when you share it with someone.\nMy husband\u2019s and my costs went way down when we moved in together. We share a bed and a kitchen table and bookshelves. We only need one grinder, one set of pots, and one replica of Aragorn\u2019s sword (and they were all wedding gifts). If we are ever able to afford a home, it will be because there are two of us who earn money, have savings, and can take care of it. Marriage is straight-up privilege in today\u2019s world.\n4. Everyone needs a financial, healthcare, and social safety net.\nRelated to the previous point, only one of us has to work to have healthcare now, which is how I\u2019m able to continue running Dweebs Global without being paid. I have someone to lean on financially without worrying about making rent on my own. If my husband withdraws from society for a while, he has my friends and family to lean on as much as his. Marriage basically takes your available financial and social capital and doubles it.\n5. Everyone needs an emotional safety net and a family.\nI know that when my friends say I\u2019m family, they actually mean \u201cafter my \u2018real family.\u2019\u201d My literal best friend of many years \u2014 who predates my husband\u2014 told me that although I\u2019m like his sister, I obviously have a weaker inherent tie than the blood bonds that come from his actual siblings. It\u2019s not that he loves me less, it\u2019s that it\u2019s different.\nThere is no realer family that society will recognize than spouses, stupid as it is. This is especially true for straight men, who are often told they can only open up emotionally with their wives.\n6. Married people are healthier.\nMarried people are happier, get treated better by doctors, have the time and ability to cook more regularly, have more sex, and live longer. Even having someone to notice you have a weird new mole on your neck can be life-saving. (But also, read my other article before you take statistics too seriously.)\n7. It can be lonely to be single.\nI wouldn\u2019t have written this two years ago, but one of the biggest things I\u2019ve noticed post-pandemic is that the vast majority of my single friends are lonely. Most of them couldn\u2019t find someone to be locked down with and spent a year stuck with only their own company. Humans are not meant to live like that. I don\u2019t think you should get married only because you\u2019re lonely \u2014 that\u2019s a recipe for disaster \u2014 but there\u2019s no shame in wanting someone to live with and in realizing that one of the ways to find someone long-lasting is to promise them it\u2019s for life.\n8. Board games are infinitely better with two people.\nThis is something I really appreciate about being married. (Actually being married and having a sister \u2014 three people is even better.) But insert any other fun activity you want a built-in partner for: video gaming, traveling, sports, art, even sex. Marriage is good for that.\n9. The government incentivizes you to.\nMarriage can be good for your taxes. It can be good for your healthcare status, your ability to adopt a child, or your credit rating. It can get you citizenship. These are all decent reasons to get married. (But don\u2019t quote me on the last one to the State Department.)\n10. It\u2019s fun, looks fun, or you want to try it.\nThere\u2019s a Hollywood obsession with butterfly-stomach love that has frankly ruined the dating scene and our lives. Now marriage is all about intense feelings and love sickness. But it can also be a lot of fun and it doesn\u2019t have to be a big deal. Get a prenup. Don\u2019t throw a huge wedding. There\u2019s no shame in divorce, but there is a lot of money in it, so I wouldn\u2019t say to be too hasty, but don\u2019t be too cautious either.\nToday, there are a lot of complaints that people have become too picky with dating and I largely think that\u2019s true. Everyone says you have to strive for perfection, feel a magical spark, and never settle or compromise your heart. That\u2019s\u2026rubbish. My husband and I were friends for years before we had a crush on each other or fell in love, and I suspect our marriage would have turned out fine even if we had ended up together as friends. We are the same people, after all, and most of what we do isn\u2019t limited to spousal behavior.\nThere\u2019s an old Myspace or Tumblr saying that a girl can survive without a boyfriend, but not without a best friend (an imperfect best friend who comes with no sparkly feelings). Sisters before misters. And if the most important relationships are friendships, it\u2019s that we should be immortalizing in movies and sealing for life in \u201cmarriage,\u201d not romance.\nIn conclusion, get married. Not because I\u2019m a big believer in the frankly absurd institution \u2014 I\u2019m not \u2014 but because there are a thousand reasons why the institution exists in the first place and why it\u2019s beneficial in a society that has designed itself to support it. Marriage was historically intended for stability from a well-thought out, mutually beneficial partnership, and not whatever magic illusion falling in love is.\nIf you need more sexual excitement, consider finding it in threesomes or an open relationship (with your partner\u2019s consent of course \u2014 honesty is key). If you need more romantic excitement, same thing. Maybe even get married to a friend and eternally find the romance and the sex elsewhere. Queer platonic relationships are on the rise in the LGBTQ+ community and out of it.\nTo this extremely progressive suggestion, you may say, \u201cWhat? Are you crazy? Don\u2019t you just mean \u2018friends\u2019 or \u2018extended family,\u2019 then? Why marriage?\u201d\nAnd I would say, \u201cYes, you are absolutely right. The fact you can only get a long-term life partnership out of marriage is dumb as rocks.\u201d\nBut it is how society works today and it is only heading more in that bleak direction. Gone are houses of worship (possibly a good thing), community centers (probably a bad thing), and even offices (definitely a mixed thing). People are getting physically and emotionally lonelier. Friends are expected to drift apart. And modern American culture is about forcing your kids out of the house at eighteen, shaming adult children for close relationships with their parents and siblings, and assuming everyone has to take care of their nuclear family first.\nForget society. The law will uphold the same rights. You don\u2019t even get out of incriminating your children, but you can claim spousal privilege in court.\nSo what do you do? You could fight it. I know I am. But I also have more important fights to pick and having a husband is gosh darn useful, in addition to frankly being a ton of fun. And coming from a broken family outside of my immediate relations, I get it. It\u2019s how the world is.\nToday, I think that marriages would be less scary and last longer if they were more about a strong, healthy, mutually beneficial partnership between similar people who love each other than a crazy whirlwind of jealous romance and passionate sex appeal.\nI am, of course, grateful to my husband for the unconditional love he gives me, for our deep kisses, and for the poetry we once wrote each other. But I am even more grateful for him cooking food because I was tired, buying shower caps from Target, and checking this article for typos. There is nothing bigger than the little things.\nAnd I suspect that\u2019s what marriage was always supposed to be about anyway.\n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014\nMore of my stories about modern love:\nOne of My Married Friends Is Still In Love With Me\nThere is no drama, here.

The city had annexed my neighborhood in 1958 but the street in front of my home was red clay dirt and sometimes impassable\u2026\nPhoto by Michael Herren on Unsplash\nReturn to the daze of my youth.\nIt was the summer of 1963. A time of innocence. My brothers and I were playing in the front yard. As is common for summer afternoons here in North Carolina the winds were picking up, and dust devils swirled on the unpaved road in front of our house. A storm was on its way.\nIn those days there were far fewer houses near my home than there are today. The city annexed my neighborhood in 1958 but the street in front of my home remained red clay dirt, and sometimes impassable to the west, where drivers had to ford what remains to this day an unnamed stream we called the creek. I remember seeing cars stuck in the creek for days on end because it was too muddy to drive in and pull them out, and wreckers couldn\u2019t get close enough to winch them out.\nWe played in and around the creek almost every day, but on that day it remained in the distance. While the area next to the creek was heavily wooded, there was a quarter mile or so of barren red clay in-between the woods and our house. Just a few years before most of our neighbors were cows, but a new housing development was on the way, hence the barren land that had only been recently graded causing the creek to sometimes run red as it continued to the north.\nIt was while we were playing that one of my brothers first noticed what appeared to be a blue flying saucer haphazardly wobbling its way eastward across the sky to the south of our house before finally landing in another wooded area to the south. The four of us stared in amazement, certain that someone was inside.\nWe were expecting it to contain little green men as President Kennedy\u2019s proclamation that Americans would travel to the Moon in just a few short years had children everywhere dreaming about space\u2026 And dream we did.\nOff we went running as fast as we could in an effort to find the UFO, and greet the little green men who would surely be inside. We searched and searched until suddenly we came upon a couple of little girls we had never before seen. \u201cCan you help us?\u201d the younger girl asked.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d the older of the two chimed in, \u201ca whirlwind picked up our swimming pool and made it fly away.\u201d\nWe searched until the rains drove us home, but we couldn\u2019t find the flying pool that day. A few months later, come Autumn, as the leaves fell from the trees, we spotted the tiny UFO tangled and torn in the branches of a very tall oak tree.\nToday, just a few feet from where the UFO landed there is an old pick-up truck with a giant tree growing through it as if to mark the spot.\nThe daze of my youth continue with No One Listens Until it\u2019s Too Late.", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 12, "created_time": 1650406914162, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["UFO", "Ufo Sightings", "Daze Of My Youth", "Short Story", "Billy Jones"]}, {"author": "Billy Jones", "post_id": "1f138ae441eb", "user_id": "cea404ca44d9", "title": "Lemon Gets a Job", "content": "Lemon Gets a Job\nPhoto by Ernie Journeys on Unsplash\nOrange said, \u201cThe time has come, it\u2019s time I paid my way.\u201d\nBut nobody would hire him.

The rest of this post will be in Norwegian.\nVisste du at Norge er den dyreste land til \u00e5 kj\u00f8pe alkohol og tobakk i hele Europa, Til og med h\u00f8yere en Sweits og Island. Norge ligger 136 prosent over snittet i forhold til resten av Europa. Alkohol er en fargel\u00f8s v\u00e6ske vanlighis drukket i alle former fra brennevin med h\u00f8yest konsentrasjon av alkohol, til \u00f8l og vin med lavere konsentrasjoner.

De gjorde dette ved \u00e5 \u00f8ke avgiftene p\u00e5 alkohol. Avgiftene kan bidra til velferdsstaten og forbedre livskvaliteten til mange ved bruk av disse pengene.

But Who Did It?", "content": "Two Were Arrested in Connection to Billions in Hacked Bitcoin. But Who Did It?\nOn Tuesday, the federal government seized more than 94,000 Bitcoin ($3.6 billion) directly connected to the 2016 hack of a crypto exchange called Bitfinex and arrested two individuals for allegedly conspiring to launder those funds.\n(At the time of the original hack, the amount stolen was about $60 million, and the value has appreciated along with the price of bitcoin.)\nThe couple arrested, Ilya Lichtenstein and Heather Morgan, appeared in court Tuesday afternoon and were originally sentenced to home detention with a wearable GPS and released on a $5 million bond and a $3 million bond, respectively. However, late on Tuesday night, that was stayed, meaning they\u2019ll only be able to leave if a court in Washington, D. C., allows it.\nIlya Lichtensten and Heather Morgan\nCrypto Twitter delighted in the many delicious details of the couple\u2019s history and online presence \u2014 from the fact that he was an alum of Y Combinator and that she was previously a Forbes contributor to the plethora of cringe-y rap videos that she had posted online.\n\nBut one aspect of what was revealed today is confusing. The government said that the couple were in possession of the wallet that directly received the proceeds from the hack, as seen below. (VCE stands for \u201cvirtual currency exchange.\u201d)\n\nHowever, it did not allege that they had hacked the exchange. The complaint only detailed how they tried to launder the 119,754 bitcoin. The press release says, \u201cAccording to court documents, Lichtenstein and Morgan allegedly conspired to launder the proceeds of 119,754 bitcoin that were stolen from Bitfinex\u2019s platform after a hacker breached Bitfinex\u2019s systems and initiated more than 2,000 unauthorized transactions. Those unauthorized transactions sent the stolen bitcoin to a digital wallet under Lichtenstein\u2019s control.\u201d\nThis makes it seem as though the hacker was a different entity. However, the complaint itself, after detailing all the various exchange accounts were laundered and how they were connected to the couple, also noted, \u201cLICHTENSTEIN\u2019s cloud storage account also contained a folder named \u2018personas.\u2019 The \u2018personas\u2019 folder contained biographical information and identification documents for numerous individuals. The account also included a text file named \u2018passport_ideas\u2019 that included links to different darknet vendor accounts that appeared to be offering passports or identification cards for sale.\u201d\nAlso, as Inner City Press reported, \u201cThey had 50 electronic devices, in a bag labeled \u2018burner phones.\u2019\u201d\nAll of that seems like some sort of indication of guilt \u2014 or, at the very least, an awareness that they might someday need to run.\nThose details would go toward the argument that they could also have been the hackers. Plus, it seems that if someone went to the trouble to pull off a big heist. they likely would not just hand over the proceeds to someone else. (Though, it\u2019s possible they sold the ill-gotten goods to the couple)\nBut a number of facts in the case also confound the theory that they were the hackers. First, the couple stayed right in the US, easily within the reach of law enforcement.\n\nIn fact, they were living in New York City, under the jurisdiction in the Southern District of New York, which is considered the premier federal prosecutor\u2019s office in the country, and is especially known for its pursuit of financial crimes. (Although the complaint filed today was by a criminal investigator for the Internal Revenue Service, it seems like if they had committed a crime, they wouldn\u2019t want to be right under the nose of SDNY, due to its reputation.)\nThen, there were the videos. My personal hypothesis is that if you had committed a crime, you\u2019d try to keep a somewhat low profile, but that may be unrelated.\nThe last and most important confounding bit is that, if they were the hackers, their operations security (opsec) was lacking. Oftentimes, when the government catches crypto criminals, it\u2019s not a given that they can actually obtain the ill-gotten digital goods. If the hacker has secured their funds well, the only way the government could actually obtain control over the crypto would be if the hacker gave them the ability to do so. It\u2019s entirely plausible that someone could be jailed for a crypto crime but not actually give up the private keys to the stolen goods, and keep their secret while incarcerated.\nHowever, in the case of Lichtenstein and Morgan, the government, with a search warrant, decrypted a file they had stored in the cloud, which contained 2,000 crypto addresses along with their private keys.\nIf they were smart enough to hack the exchange, it seems they would have been smart enough to keep their private keys offline. This could lend more credence to the idea that they aren\u2019t also the hackers.\nAt the moment, we only know that the complaint only alleged that they committed money laundering and not the hack. With facts giving some credence to the notion that they could be the hackers, and other facts making it seem plausible that they are not, I guess we\u2019ll have to wait to see what further facts emerge in this case.\nThanks for reading!

FTX cofounder and CEO Sam Bankman-Fried donated a quarter million dollars in Tether, and Chain.com CEO Deepak Thapliyal made a donation of ETH worth slightly more in dollar terms.\n\nOther pro-Ukrainian accounts such as Come Back Alive and Support Ukrainian Sovereignty, have also received crypto donations. And UkraineDAO, organized by the band Pussy Riot, quickly amassed more than $3 million in donations.\nBut also, within days, President Joe Biden\u2019s administration was considering sanctions on Russia\u2019s crypto markets. There was also concern that crypto could be used to evade sanctions. Certainly that\u2019s an issue that Senator Elizabeth Warren raised. She tweeted:\n\nBloomberg pointed out the reason for this belief that crypto could undermine sanctions is that that system requires intermediaries. However, with crypto, this could happen via decentralized exchanges or peer-to-peer trades that don\u2019t involve an intermediary.\nA number of crypto companies and players asserted that large-scale money laundering would be unlikely because of the public nature of most blockchains \u2014 the transactions are easily recognized since the most widely used blockchains are transparent, making the movements of the money visible, as was pointed out by blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis.\n\nJerry Brito, executive director of Coin Center, also tweeted that The New York Times was light on specifics on how Russia would actually use crypto to make up for lost revenue from sanctions. He mentioned that the idea of a digital ruble was mentioned in the NYT article as a way to circumvent sanctions, but it doesn\u2019t currently exist, which would make it hard to offset revenue losses.\nThe crypto community, likely due to its libertarian origins, seemed even more concerned about a request made by Ukrainian vice prime minister Mykhailo Fedorov to have crypto exchanges freeze the accounts of not just Russian and Belarusian politicians but also ordinary citizens.\n\nMultiple crypto exchanges made it clear that without a legal request to do so, they could not acquiesce to such a request, despite their sympathies for the Ukrainian people.\nJesse Powell, CEO of exchange Kraken (disclosure: a former sponsor of my shows), tweeted, \u201cI understand the rationale for this request but, despite my deep respect for the Ukrainian people, @krakenfx cannot freeze the accounts of our Russian clients without a legal requirement to do so. Russians should be aware that such a requirement could be imminent. #NYKNYC\u201d (The hashtag refers to the saying \u201cnot your keys, not your coins.\u201d)\nBinance, the largest crypto exchange in the world, told CNBC, \u201cCrypto is meant to provide greater financial freedom for people across the globe. To unilaterally decide to ban people\u2019s access to their crypto would fly in the face of the reason why crypto exists.\u201d\nThe stance comes right out of Bitcoin and crypto\u2019s overall early origins, in which bitcoin appealed to libertarians early on.

Here\u2019s How We Jumped Past One Critical Step", "content": "Who Hacked the DAO on Ethereum? Here\u2019s How We Jumped Past One Critical Step\nEthereum, the second-largest crypto network, has achieved success well beyond what its creator, Vitalik Buterin, could have imagined when he initially thought up the smart contract platform as a teenager in the fall of 2013.\nIt has a market cap of over $300 billion, it\u2019s become popular with the likes of Mark Cuban, and it\u2019s the leading force in many of the new trends in crypto, such as initial coin offerings back in the first big crypto mania in 2017 and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) today.\nToday, in Forbes and on my podcast, I announced that, in the course of writing my book, The Cryptopians: Idealism, Greed, Lies, and the Making of the First Big Cryptocurrency Craze, my sources and I believe we figured out who was behind the biggest theft ever of ether (ETH), the asset native to Ethereum, back in 2016.\nWith the price of ETH hovering at around $3,000 recently, the amount taken \u2014 then 5% of all ETH \u2014 would be worth about $11 billion today.\n\n(Read the Forbes article, listen to my podcast and buy my book to find out the identity of this suspect and learn more about the theft.)\nThe Backstory\nHere\u2019s how Ethereum\u2019s first and only existential crisis unfolded. In the spring of 2016, the fledgling blockchain had little activity, but people were really into one application on it: the DAO, a decentralized venture fund that would receive proposals for funding, which the DAO members would vet and vote on. The DAO became so popular, that by the end of its crowdfunding period, which finished near the end of May, it had become the highest crowdfunded project of all time, raising about $139 million by the ETH price that day.\nIn short order, 31% of all the ETH in the DAO was drained \u2014 moved to a so-called \u201cchild DAO\u201d in small amounts over the course of hours \u2014 by a hacker who had control of that child DAO. However, by the rules of the DAO, the funds were trapped there for about a month.\nDuring that time, Ethereum decided to conduct a \u201chard fork\u201d (non-backwards compatible change) that would enable all the people who lost money in the DAO to get ETH back. That resulted in a new, competing blockchain called Ethereum Classic, where the more than 3 million hacked ether classic (ETC) are worth more than $100 million.\nSo, what does this finding say about the development of crypto?\nA Break in Cracking the Case\nOne of the keys to unlocking what, until now, has been the biggest whodunnit in crypto is a previously undisclosed tool by blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis that enabled us to follow the trail past what previously was a point of obfuscation impossible to follow.\nBasically, the stolen ETC was not very liquid \u2014 first, because ETC was a new coin, but second, because the loot was visible on the Ethereum Classic blockchain, and so if the hacker ever tried to use that money, people would know where it came from.\nFor this reason, they converted some of it to bitcoin, which was then and still is the most liquid cryptocurrency. They used an exchange called ShapeShift, which did not require an account or take any personally identifying information.\nOnce they had about 282 bitcoins, they gave up cashing out and never touched the ETC again. However, those bitcoins were now associated with the hack.\nAt this point, the attacker used a Wasabi wallet, which mixes many transactions together in order to obscure the funds flow in a process called a CoinJoin. It was thought that the bitcoins spit out on the other side of a CoinJoin were impossible to trace back.\nWhile at that time, it may have been sufficient to turn the trail cold, with this news, Chainalysis is disclosing for the first time that it is able to de-mix such transactions.\nWhen the attacker used Wasabi, they must have felt that their bitcoins had been sufficiently laundered. However, that was no longer true once Chainalysis\u2019s technology improved over time.\nWhat This Means for Privacy Technologies\nWhile there are many legitimate reasons for wanting to have privacy around financial transactions, this development may curb the use of mixers for illicit purposes.\nNow that it\u2019s known that Chainalysis has this capability, anyone who has used a Wasabi CoinJoin for nefarious purposes is likely looking over their shoulder. While this is a win for the victims of any similar crypto thefts or hacks, it isn\u2019t for people with benign reasons for wanting privacy.\nIt remains to be seen how this affects the behavior of those who are using crypto for unlawful reasons. Already, illicit transactions in crypto account for a mere 0.15% of all financial activity, according to Chainalysis. But seeing how it only took time for forensics to catch up, this news could further dampen the appetite for nefarious activity in crypto.\nThanks for reading!

She decided to go into public policy in order to address that, becoming a lawyer and ending up at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau after the financial crisis. There, she learned about Bitcoin.\nIn the latest episode of my podcast, Unchained, she says she became interested in it, because \u201cThe economy has not met places like Ohio with \u2026 opportunity. There\u2019s been a lot of capital accumulation on the coasts, and a lot of places in the Midwest are not faring as well, and people don\u2019t feel like they have access to the traditional financial system as well to be able to build wealth. In conversations with people about crypto/blockchain technology/web3, [I\u2019ve been] hearing that this might be something that gets us closer to level the playing field and from people in Ohio who are excited about it.\u201d\n\nAnother Democratic candidate for Congress, Shrina Kurani, says that her experience working in financial technology showed her that \u201cmost American people don\u2019t have access to capital\u201d and \u201cwe\u2019re seeing increased disparities across the board.\u201d She feels that crypto and web3 give people \u201cthe opportunity to own our assets. And rather than the centralization of power that we\u2019ve traditionally seen with technology, we now have the opportunity to decentralize is that power and actually bring profit back to the people.\u201d\nAlthough some of the most vocal anti-crypto lawmakers, such as Rep. Brad Sherman and Senator Elizabeth Warren, and regulators, such as Gary Gensler, are Democrats, Harper and Kurani represent a new wave of Democratic candidates who are embracing crypto and Web3. Among the Congressional candidates who are running on pro-crypto or pro-Bitcoin platforms, the majority (at least as far as I could tell from an article I wrote earlier this week) are Democrats.\nHarper\u2019s opinion on people with a staunchly anti-crypto stance is, \u201cThere are very few things that we could just be a hard \u2018no\u2019 on. Especially when they\u2019re somewhat newer, we need to be in a posture of gathering information and doing what\u2019s best for the people that we represent.\u201d\nBecause she\u2019s finding constituents in Ohio who are interested in crypto and who say it created new avenues to wealth for them, she says, \u201cI need to be representing them in a good way and getting more information and supporting them.\u201d\nOn top of that, her time with the CFPB made her aware of \u201creal issues with the existing financial system.\u201d She criticized how \u201cpredatory\u201d banks charge people overdraft fees even when it would be possible for them to warn the customers when they were close to overdrafing their accounts.\nKurani agreed, noting that, compared to crime in the traditional financial system, \u201cthe percentage of crypto that actually has some of this activity is incredibly small.\u201d\nFor her part, Kurani turned to crypto because she felt that the traditional methods for campaign fundraising, for instance, require \u201c30+ hours of fundraising on the phone talking to donors.\u201d She said this was part of the reason that female candidates lag behind their male counterparts by a half million dollars on average. \u201cEspecially as a woman of color, you\u2019re really trying to make do with a lot less compared to your competitors and to the other people that are in the field. And so you have to get creative.\u201d\nThis caused her to turn to non-fungible tokens or NFTs. She became the first congressional candidate to sell NFTs, which she says helped save her quite a few hours on the phone talking up potential donors.\nLike Harper, she feels that since the constituents she hopes to represent are interested in it, this isn\u2019t something she can ignore. \u201cWe need to make sure that we\u2019re actually representing the interest of American people and a good chunk of Americans own crypto,\u201d she says.\nTune into the full episode to hear:\nhow they square their interest in crypto with their environmental concerns\nhow it\u2019s brought them unexpected supporters\nhow they think the Democratic party should approach crypto\nhow they think crypto should be regulated\nwhy they don\u2019t think crypto supporters should be single-issue voters\nThanks for reading!

I have published two articles before February, 24 claiming that Ukraine will resist, however, even I could not imagine the scale of Ukrainian bravery \u2014 the bravery that is now recognized all over the world. In this article, I will present some updates on the situation in Ukraine and will also remind you that we stay strong.\nTimes Square now.\nI published my previous article on Medium more than a month ago. For all this time, I\u2019ve been in Kyiv contributing to the victory of Ukraine. Of course, sometimes it was difficult because I live near the north-western border of Kyiv which is really close to the suburbs of Kyiv which were occupied by Russian forces (I mean, Bucha, Irpin, and Hostomel). I\u2019ve heard artillery shellings almost every evening and some bombs even damaged buildings in my neighborhood.\nMy sister\u2019s residential complex before Russian aggression in Kyiv. Located less than 2km from my home.\nMy sister\u2019s residential complex after Russian shellings.\nShopping mall \u2018Retroville\u2019 destroyed by a Russian missile. Located 2km from my home (my house actually shook because of this shelling).\nNevertheless, Russian forces have left Kyiv suburbs as well as the Chernihiv and Sumy regions. The consequences of their \u2018activity\u2019 near Kyiv are shocking and sickening. You have probably already seen the pictures of murdered civilian Ukrainians in Bucha, Irpin, Motyzhyn, and other locations. Although this tragedy is known as the Bucha massacre, in reality, Bucha is not the only city whose residents suffered from Russian atrocities. Those people were murdered with their hands tied behind their backs, raped, burnt alive, and tortured. As for the cities, they are heavily damaged. Once prosperous suburbs of Kyiv are in ruins now.\nResidential district in the city of Irpin.\nHowever, shortly after these cities (or at least some of their streets) were demined, thousands of Ukrainians volunteered to clean up and rebuild them. My sister and I joined these volunteers and went to Irpin, Bucha, and Hostomel to help revive these cities. We cleaned up shattered glass, bricks, window frames that fell out of the buildings due to explosions, parts of vehicles that exploded on the streets, cartridge cases from different weapons, etc.\nMe and my sister Mariana cleaning up the ruins in Hostomel.\nThe ruins themselves and volunteers who clean them up.

Before and after Russian aggression (picture 2 taken by my sister on April, 16).\nThe residents of these cities welcomed us and joined volunteers in cleaning. They also treated us with homemade fruit drinks (called compote) and told us about the weeks under bombings. Despite the fact that their cities are heavily damaged, people still try to keep them clean. One of the residents of Irpin showed us the hall of the residential building he lives in. The walls in this hall are decorated with embroidered paintings created by artists all over Ukraine, like in a museum. It amazed me how these people love their native city and take care of their houses.\n\nThe pictures of me in the hall of the residential building in Irpin. The building is partly damaged by shellings, however, the embroidered paintings are preserved.\nThe retreat of the Russian forces from the Kyiv region also allowed me to help Ukrainian Army more actively. All this time I worked as one of the coordinators of the Charitable Fund \u201cVzaemodopomoha\u201d (Mutual Aid) which provides one of the divisions \u2014 named \u201cUVO\u201d \u2014 with military equipment. The Fund was established in 2014 as a part of the human rights organization \u201cSyndykat\u201d in which I work as a human rights activist. Here\u2019s the short video about the division \u201cUVO\u201d on Swedish TV4 (many thanks to brave journalists that come to Ukraine to document the war). Many \u201cUVO\u201d fighters are my close friends, some of whom I met years ago when I started my military training. We have provided the \u201cUVO\u201d division with a variety of necessary equipment and medicine (including bulletproof vests and helmets, drones, thermal vision gadgets, etc.). It is nearly impossible to buy military equipment in Ukraine nowadays, so we are in a constant search of equipment abroad (in Europe, Canada, and the US). We also need to deliver everything we buy abroad to Ukraine and then to the location of the \u201cUVO\u201d division. Basically, we work full-time to contribute to the victory of our country. If you want to support our work \u2014 you can do it here.\n\nFighters of the \u201cUVO\u201d division. Credit for Photo 2: J.B. Russell.\nIndeed, with the beginning of the Russian full-scale invasion, Ukrainian forces still lack some equipment because hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians joined Armed Forces in order to protect their homeland. So, Ukrainian volunteers still have a lot of work to do. Another thing that amazes me about Ukrainian resistance is a phenomenal global network of volunteers that are united to help Ukraine in its struggle against Russian aggression. This network includes volunteers here in Ukraine, Ukrainians that live abroad, and people from other countries that support us. I\u2019m not sure whether there is a more powerful network of volunteers in the world.\nMe and some \u201cUVO\u201d fighters that protected Kyiv and will fight against Russian forces at the eastern borders of Ukraine soon.\nAs for Ukrainian fighters, their fighting spirit remains high. The number of casualties on the part of Russia is currently more than 20,000. Ukraine still controls the sky (by the way, air defense in Ukraine is much better now, after we received some weapons from friendly countries). Although we don\u2019t have as powerful navy forces as Russia yet, Ukraine damaged two Russian warships \u2014 \u201cOrsk\u201d in the Azov Sea and \u201cMoskva\u201d in the Black Sea. The last one was shot by two Ukrainian anti-ship cruise missiles \u201cNeptun\u201d. Also, I want to share two videos that demonstrate Ukrainian bravery. One from Mariupol with legendary Azov fighters and their fighting spirit and another one with a brave Ukrainian woman that drives an artillery vehicle singing \u201cHolding Out For A Hero\u201d by Bonnie Tyler.\nRussian warship \u201cOrsk\u201d is burning near Berdiansk, the Azov Sea.\nFan-art for Ukrainian anti-ship cruise missiles \u201cNeptun\u201d created by Andrii Dankovych.\nOf course, we have losses and it is difficult to face such a scale of destruction and deaths that was brought to our homeland by Russia. Difficult battles lie ahead. Nevertheless, we stand united and strong. The victory is closer with every day of hard work of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, volunteers who provide them with equipment, take care of refugees, provide humanitarian aid and food for soldiers and civilians, doctors, firefighters, businesses, patrons, blood donors, journalists, our friends from abroad and friendly countries, and many of those who support Ukraine around the globe.

Accordingly, it seems that after the failure in a fight against the Ukrainian Army, Russia decided to fight against civilians.

On the north, there are three large cities Russia is trying to conquer \u2014 Sumy, Chernihiv, and Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine. Taking into account the bombings of Zhytomyr, Russia may be also interested in this city since blocking it may also block some routes to Kyiv from the western part of Ukraine. In the eastern direction, Russian troops attempt to conquer Kharkiv as well as the rest of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Finally, the southern direction is currently the most successful for Russia (hopefully, not for a long time): Russian forces temporarily occupied Kherson, a range of smaller cities on the Azov Sea (e.g. Melitopol and Berdiansk), Enerhodar and attempt to occupy Mykolaiv.\nThe map of the Russian invasion. Russian forces cannot control the whole regions and regional centers of Ukraine, so they gradually move to their objects of interest: Chernihiv, Sumy, and Kyiv on the North; Kharkiv on the East; and Kherson, Mariupol, Mykolaiv on the South. Note that the whole regions marked with red are Crimea and a part of Donbas occupied by Russia in 2014, not in 2022. This map is created by Nathan Ruser, however, I edited it to demonstrate the cities of interest for Russia (yellow points), as well as the cities that are currently under Russian control (marked with red points).\nKyiv\nFirst, the situation in Kyiv is in total control of Ukrainian authorities. During the two weeks, Russia did not succeed in surrounding the city. Russian troops came close to Kyiv only in the north-western direction by passing the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant Zone of Alienation. In other words, since it was too dangerous to fight near the Chornobyl power plant, Ukrainians were forced to retreat, and Russian troops used it to move forward.\nThe map of the Kyiv region. The city of Kyiv is located at the center. Territories partly controlled by Russian troops are marked with red. As you see, Kyiv is far from being besieged.\nAs noted above, Kyiv is guarded as a fortress. There are numerous checkpoints and barricades around the city, as well as inside it. The city is guarded by Army, police, and territorial defense forces. Moreover, as I mentioned in my previous article, civilians that live in Kyiv also help to prepare Kyiv for possible attacks on the part of Russians. In particular, numerous Molotov cocktails are already prepared for Russian troops, and every civilian that has a weapon is allowed to use it against Russian soldiers. It should be noted that Ukrainians are experienced in building barricades and preparing Molotov cocktails due to the revolution that took place 8 years ago.\nBarricades in the city center of Kyiv now. Photo credit: Kateryna Hatsenko.\nBarricades built by protesters in the city center of Kyiv in 2014.\nWhile Kyiv is relatively safe (except for everyday rocket and aircraft bombings that are blocked by our air defense forces), Kyiv suburbs suffer from Russian troops. Russian soldiers commit military crimes in several small towns and villages near Kyiv. At the beginning of the war, the world was shocked by the photographs from Borodianka \u2014 a small town located nearly 50km from Kyiv that was bombed by Russia with the use of missiles.\nBuildings in Borodianka ruined by a Russian missile. Nearly, there is a monument of the foremost Ukrainian poet Taras Shevchenko whose poetry inspires Ukrainians to fight for our freedom.\nHowever, the military crimes of Russian troops did not end in Borodianka. The most fierce battles in the Kyiv region took place in three cities \u2014 Hostomel, Bucha, and Irpin. Currently, two of them (along with some small villages located nearby) are controlled by Russians. Irpin is partly under Russian control. Two weeks ago, these cities were typical suburbs with townhouses, parks, and everything for comfortable life. However, the war has changed everything, leaving the citizens without their homes, Internet or cell phone connection, food, and electricity. Russian troops prevent the evacuation of civilians and shoot them when they attempt to flee from the city. For example, Russian troops killed a Ukrainian family on the road that was reported to be within a humanitarian corridor to allow civilians to safely leave the city. Another Ukrainian family was shot by Russians from an infantry combat vehicle right in their car, for no reason. You can see the video of this cruelty here (warning, not for sensitive people).\nThe city of Irpin long before the war. It was considered the best place to live near Kyiv.\nResidential buildings destroyed in Irpin due to the war.\nA woman and her two children killed by Russian troops during the attempt to leave the city through the humanitarian corridor in Irpin.\nUkrainian Armed Forces help civilians to evacuate from Irpin.\nChernihiv and Sumy\nTwo regional centers in the north of Ukraine \u2014 Chernihiv, and Sumy \u2014 are bombed by Russian aircraft. Numerous civilians were killed due to these randomly targeted bombings. Although, maybe they are not actually targeted randomly and their purpose is to spread terror among civilian Ukrainians? The commonly accepted definition of terrorism is \u201cpolitical violence designed to induce terror and psychic fear through the violent victimization and destruction of noncombatant targets\u201d. Heavy bombing of civilians in the cities without the objects of military infrastructure may be considered nothing other than terrorism.\nResidential building in Chernihiv destroyed by Russian aircraft.\nAt the same time, these two cities, as well as other smaller cities in the region, do not give up. Territorial defense and Ukrainian Army, being supported by the local population still resist Russian troops. Chernihiv is among the cities recognized as \u2018hero city\u2019 by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\nKharkiv and the Region\nKharkiv is another regional center that suffered from the Russian invasion to the largest extent. I have already mentioned the destruction of Kharkiv city center by Russian missiles in my previous story. Currently, Russian troops still attempt to bomb this once beautiful city that was also awarded as \u2018hero city\u2019 for its stoic resistance to Russia. I also want to mention the city of Izium located in the Kharkiv region. This city was almost destroyed by the Russian army despite the fact that there is no military objects in it. According to local authorities, Russian artillery destroyed the central hospital, railway station, bus station, court building, medical college, police station, many residential buildings, and shops of this small town. Again, I cannot find any explanation of these actions other than terrorism.\nDestroyed streets of Izium, a small town in the Kharkiv region.\nMariupol\nMariupol is the only city that prevents Russia from creating a corridor from its territory to occupied Crimea. For this reason, the city is sieged by Russian forces and suffers from constant bombing on the part of Russians. In 2014, Ukrainian Armed Forces managed to protect Mariupol from Russia. This year, the situation in the city is far worse. The city that was a home for 446,000 Ukrainians is almost ruined. There is no electricity, water, or food. A 6-year-old girl Tanya Moroz died (warning, the link is not for sensitive people) because of dehydration in besieged Mariupol being trapped under the ruins of her home. Furthermore, Russian troops do not allow civilians to leave the city. For example, according to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the evacuation route out of the besieged city of Mariupol was mined by Russians.\nThe city of Mariupol is located on the coast of the Azov Sea, between the occupied Crimea and the occupied part of the Donetsk region. It is marked with the only small yellow spot on this map. Credit: Viewsridge.\nMykolaiv\nAnother large city that fights heroically against Russian aggression in Mykolaiv. Led by charismatic Head of Regional State Administration Vitalii Kim, Mykolaiv with its successful defense is currently one of the most popular cities among foreign journalists. Kim posts updates on the situation in the city in his Telegram blog. Mykolaiv was attacked and bombed by artillery many times, however, Vitalii Kim\u2019s fighting spirit inspires the whole of Ukraine. He explains that he just does not worry about the things he cannot change and, thus keeps calm and does the right things.\nVitalii Kim, the Head of Regional State Administration in Mykolaiv, in his office.\nNuclear Power Plants\nAside from Russia\u2019s military crimes against Ukrainian civilians, the whole world follows the situation with Russian troops near Ukrainian nuclear power plants. For Ukrainians, it is not a joke. Thirty-six years ago, in 1986, our country faced the disaster of Chornobyl that also impacted the rest of the world. Therefore, we take nuclear power safety very seriously. Obviously, Russia does not. After the beginning of the war with Ukraine, everyone wonders whether Putin may destroy the world with a nuclear weapon. In 2018, he said that he does not need the world without Russia. In particular, his words were \u201cIf someone decides to destroy Russia, we have the right to respond. Yes, it will be a global disaster for humanity, however, as a citizen of Russia and the Russian president, I want to ask: why do we need the world without Russia?\u201d This is insane, especially taking into account that Putin sees threats to Russia in everything. For example, according to his propaganda, Russia just had to attack Ukraine to protect itself.\nNaturally, the dangers of nuclear power along with Putin\u2019s attitude to the safety of the world are worrying. Considering that Russian troops already control two large nuclear power plants in Ukraine, one may assume that Putin wants to issue ultimatums to Ukraine by intimidating to blow up (or cause any other harm) nuclear power plants in our country. Currently, the Chornobyl nuclear power plant controlled by Russians is de-energized, in two days the cooling system of the storage of spent nuclear fuel will be turned off, which will threaten the leakage of radiation. This week Russians also started a battle near Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, thus putting Ukraine and Europe in danger. Indeed, when in 1986, in Chornobyl, only one reactor exploded causing harm for many generations, imagine the possible harm that may be caused by Russians in Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant that has 6 reactors. As noted by the Ukrainian Minister of Foreign Affairs, \u201cThe barbaric war of the Russian Federation threatens the whole of Europe. Putin must stop it immediately!\u201d\nResistance of the Local Population\nNumerous murders of civilians committed by Russian troops (including aircraft and artillery) result in even fiercer resistance on the part of Ukrainians. As noted by one of the Ukrainian soldiers that fled from territories occupied by Russians in the Kyiv region, Russian troops evoke pure hatred among the population in temporarily occupied cities and villages. I have already mentioned the protests organized by Ukrainians against Russian troops in Melitopol, Berdiansk, and Kherson. After two weeks of the war, the resistance continues. For example, in a wide range of cities in the Kherson region civilians have gathered to protest against Russian occupation. These cities include Kherson itself, Oleshky, Novooleksiivka, Chaplynka, Nova Kakhovka, Henichesk, Kalanchak, and others. Kherson citizens also refused to take humanitarian help from Russian troops. Let me remind you how dangerous it is to protest in temporarily occupied cities: in some of the aforementioned cities, armed Russian troops opened fire against civilian protesters.\nProtest against Russian occupation in Kherson. A Ukrainian man holds a sign \u2018Kherson is Ukraine\u2019.\nThe protests were also organized in other regions of Ukraine, for example, Chernihiv and Zaporizhzhia regions. In particular, in Melitopol, Berdiansk and Enerhodar Ukrainians repeatedly protested against Russian troops. Yesterday, the citizens of Horodnia, Chernihiv region, went to the streets to celebrate the birthday of the foremost Ukrainian poet Taras Shevchenko whose poetry inspires Ukrainians to fight for our freedom.\nCitizens of Melitopol burn the scarecrow of Putin in response to the temporary occupation of their city.\nCitizens of Enerhodar block the road for Russian troops to prevent the occupation of their city.\nCitizens of Horodnia celebrate the birthday of the foremost Ukrainian poet Taras Shevchenko on the temporarily occupied streets of their city.\nYes, we fight against one of the largest armies in the world. Yes, it is difficult and we have lost some territories. We have lost numerous brothers and sisters. The war killed tens of children. Nevertheless, our spirit is indomitable. Putin wanted to terrorize us? He only got us even angrier and determined to resist till the end.\nOh bury me, then rise ye up\nAnd break your heavy chains\nAnd water with the tyrants\u2019 blood\nThe freedom you have gained.\nTaras Shevchenko, Ukrainian poet", "comment_count": 1, "like_count": 279, "created_time": 1646860883357, "comment": [{"user_id": "31f216d1b6be", "comment_time": 1646860883357, "comment": "Thank you for sharing!"}, {"user_id": "c8de2870b298", "comment_time": 1647051816655, "comment": "Still standing STRONG"}], "post_tag": ["Ukraine", "Russia", "Russo Ukrainian War", "Ukrainian"]}, {"author": "Nataliia Buchkovych", "post_id": "34f9348925a9", "user_id": "31f216d1b6be", "title": "Voice of Ukrainian: What Is Going on in Ukraine? Ukrainians Resist Russian Aggression", "content": "Voice of Ukrainian: What Is Going on in Ukraine? Ukrainians Resist Russian Aggression\nI think I will never forget the night of the first bombing of Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine, by Russia. I did not sleep that night and at 5 a.m. I\u2019ve heard the sounds of explosions. I watched the video of Putin declaring war against Ukraine with goosebumps on my skin. To be honest, I did not believe that it would happen until it actually did. Now, after almost a week of the constant bombing of my city, I stay here in Kyiv in relative safety (can I say that I am safe if twelve hours ago a Russian missile was sent to the location 2km from my home and killed 5 civilians?). So, I decided to write an update on the situation in Ukraine as I see it.\nCivilians killed by a Russian missile, Kyiv. I blurred the image since it looks too terrible but it can be found on the Internet.\nFirst, I\u2019d like to attract your attention to the military crimes of Russia in this war. During the days of the war, more than 350 civilians were killed by Russia, including 16 children. Russia sends bombs and missiles targeting hospitals, children\u2019s hospitals (namely, the National Children\u2019s Specialized Hospital \u201cOhmatdit\u201d in which children are treated for cancer), kindergartens, residential houses, streets with civilians, etc. Currently, the city of Kharkiv is heavily bombed by Russians with the use of missiles and aircraft. Kharkiv is one of the main targets of Russia since it is located not far from the Russian border. Numerous civilians were killed, others were heavily injured due to the bombings. For example, one elderly woman died because her legs were torn off by an explosion (this video is age-restricted, do not watch it if you can\u2019t watch the scenes of serious injuries and deaths). Russian forces also bombed the central square of Kharkiv leaving it in ruins.\nThe Square of Freedom in Kharkiv, one of the largest cities in Ukraine.\nLet me remind you that bombing civilian objects (as well as civilians themselves) is a war crime. Accordingly, the prosecutor of the international criminal court (ICC) in The Hague has announced that he will launch an investigation into possible war crimes or crimes against humanity in Ukraine. We, Ukrainians, hope that soon we will see Putin and all Russian military officers responsible for bombing civilian Ukrainians in The Hague. Currently, Ukraine collects the evidence of Russian military crimes, and civilians that witnessed such crimes also actively share them with the government by using relevant social media channels.\nThe bravery of the Ukrainian Army\nDespite the despicable actions of Russia and its president Vladimir Putin, Ukraine fights decently and courageously. As I said in the previous article, Ukrainian Armed Forces are strong. Armed and equipped with modern weapons and supported by the Ukrainian population, our Army protects Ukraine on all fronts. Yes, it is difficult since Russia has sent its troops from the Northern, Eastern, and Southern directions. However, we stand our ground. Despite the expectations of Russia to conquer Ukraine in 2\u20133 days, Ukraine still stands and no regional centers are currently occupied by Russian forces. Of course, Russian troops entered some small cities, however, the local population resists them (I will write about this further in this article).\nThe map of the Russian invasion. Russian forces cannot control the whole regions and regional centers of Ukraine, so they gradually move to their objects of interest. Remember that the situation is fluid. Note that the whole regions marked with red are Crimea and a part of Donbas occupied by Russia in 2014, not in 2022.\nThere are numerous examples of the exceptional bravery of the Ukrainian Armed Forces that have already become legendary. In particular, 13 Ukrainian warriors that represented the entirety of the Ukrainian military presence on the Snake Island (a small island located in the Black Sea) were attacked by Russian naval warships. The warships offered Ukrainian soldiers to surrender, however, Ukrainians responded \u201cRussian warship, go fuck yourself\u201d. The response gained worldwide attention and became a symbol of Ukrainian resistance.\nAnother Ukrainian hero is the so-called \u2018ghost of Kyiv\u2019. It is a disputed and unconfirmed MiG-29 Fulcrum flying ace credited with shooting down six Russian planes in the Kyiv offensive on 24 February 2022. According to the Security Service of Ukraine, he has shot down 21 Russian jets as of 1 March. Although not confirmed to be real, the Ghost of Kyiv has been credited as a morale booster for Ukrainians. As a Kyiv citizen, I am very grateful to the mysterious \u2018ghost of Kyiv\u2019 whether he really exists or this symbol represents a number of pilots that defend our capital.\nFan art of the Ghost of Kyiv created by the artist Andrii Dankovych.\nAlso, Ukrainians are very impressed by the fights of the Ukrainian Army captured on numerous videos. Our soldiers shoot Russian military equipment accurately with NLAWs, Javelins, and Bayraktars. For example, I personally was really impressed by the video of the general in a battle. I don\u2019t know whether this warrior is really the general but his confidence and determination in destroying Russian military equipment are inspiring. I\u2019d say he is a Ukrainian Rembo.\nThe war also included numerous cases of self-sacrifice on the part of Ukrainian soldiers. For example, Ukrainian hero Vitalii Skakun volunteered to place mines on the Henichesk bridge in order to slow the advance of Russian troops advancing northward from Crimea during the Kherson offensive. After placing the explosives, Skakun lacked time to withdraw from the bridge and, after texting his intentions to his fellow soldiers, detonated the mines killing himself and destroying the bridge. Skakun was posthumously awarded the Order of the Gold Star, the military version of the title of Hero of Ukraine.\nVitalii Skakun, a 25-years-old marine combat engineer that sacrificed himself to protect his homeland.\nAs for territorial defense in Ukraine, currently, the number of volunteers willing to join territorial defense exceeds the demand. Numerous Ukrainians want to fight for their homeland and stand in lines near military recruitment centers. Territorial defense in Ukraine involves more than 37,000 people. In addition, more than 80,000 Ukrainians came back to Ukraine from abroad to fight for their country. Some of them already have combat experience.\nVolunteers willing to join territorial defense in Ternopil.\nIt is evident that we, Ukrainians, are highly motivated to protect our homeland and our freedom from Russian aggression. In contrast, Russians are demotivated. Even if they enter Ukrainian cities \u2014 everything they see is hatred in the eyes of civilians. The number of casualties on the part of Russia is nearly 5300. Russian soldiers also surrender as captivities and give up their military equipment. You can find numerous videos of Russian soldiers being in captivity or dead in Ukraine on the Internet. Ukrainian Ministry of Internal Affairs has launched a website on which Russians can find their sons, brothers, fathers, and other relatives sent to Ukraine as soldiers and being killed or held in captivity. It should be noted that soldiers in captivity are treated in accordance with the Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War \u2014 they are provided with medical aid and food.\nHatred on the part of the locals\nAs mentioned above, Russian troops see only hatred in the eyes of the local population. Furthermore, the population also actively resists the Russians. Aside from joining territorial defense forces, civilian Ukrainians burn Russian vehicles and equipment with the use of Molotov cocktails, they attempt to stop Russian troops and push out Russian soldiers from Ukrainian cities.\nThe Myhalky village in the Kyiv region. The sign says \u201cBitches, get the fuck out of Ukraine and our village!\u201d.\nFor example, there are numerous videos of Ukrainians that successfully burn Russian vehicles with the use of Molotov cocktails. In this video, locals in the Sumy region burn a Russian fuel truck. In the cities where there are no Russian troops, Ukrainian civilians get ready to resist them by making Molotov cocktails on a vast scale. In particular, in Odesa that is a city located on the shores of the Black Sea, the local population gets ready to resist Russian invasion from the sea by preparing hundreds of Molotovs. The preparation of Molotov cocktails in Ukrainian cities already looks like an assembly line production. In addition to Molotovs, Ukrainians also assemble anti-tank obstacles and build barricades on the streets. In order to misinform the Russian troops, civilians also change the road signs.\nCivilians assemble anti-tank obstacles to prevent Russian invasion in their cities.\nThe road sign in Ukraine sends the Russian troops to \u2018go fuck themselves\u2019, to \u2018go fuck themselves again\u2019, and to \u2018go fuck themselves in Russia\u2019.\nIn Kharkiv, after the bombing of the central square I mentioned above, the local civilians still remain enthusiastic. Some of them even had the courage to gather at the central square to demonstrate the ruins of the city caused by the Russian Army to the Russians. These civilians, inspired by the heroic deed of the Ukrainian soldiers at the Snake Island, responded to the Russian Army with the words \u201cRussian missile, go fuck yourself!\u201d.\nBrave citizens of Kharkiv that stand in their city center ruined by a Russian missile.\nAs for the cities temporarily occupied by Russian troops, the locals gather to protest against them with Ukrainian national flags and anthem. For example, in Kupyansk and Berdyansk \u2014 Ukrainian cities located in the East of Ukraine \u2014 unarmed civilians attempted to kick out Russian soldiers. In Kupyansk, the locals raised the Ukrainian national flag near the city administration building. In Berdyansk, the locals sang the national anthem of Ukraine and chanted \u201cGet out!\u201d, \u201cRussian warship, go fuck yourself\u201d, etc. Even the kids attempted to stop the vehicle of the Russian Army in Kupyansk (Russian military vehicles in Ukraine are marked with such signs as \u2018Z\u2019, \u2018V\u2019, \u2018O\u2019, etc., so you can see that the vehicle on the video belongs to Russian Army).\nWe are united: Ukrainians help each other\nThe grief of the war unified Ukrainians. Indeed, we were never as united as now. Ukrainians organized blood donation in order to save injured people and currently, blood donation centers have a sufficient amount of blood. Ukrainians donate food to those in need, deliver food to the cities and villages that need it and even organize in groups to cook for those who at this point cannot cook by themselves (for example, soldiers, firefighters, elderly people, disabled people, etc.).\nUkrainians stand in line to donate blood.\nSince the war caused numerous people to leave their homes, Ukrainians help the refugees along with other Europeans. Those who live in relatively safe cities provide others with accommodation. Others, who live near the border with the EU, provide refugees with transport to European cities. Also, people around the world (in particular, the Ukrainian diaspora) actively donate money to buy medicine, food, and clothes for refugees. Aside from rescuing humans, Ukrainians also rescue animals that were left without their families in the cities attacked by Russia. Naturally, as in any non-stable situation, there are people that are willing to benefit from it. In this regard, Ukrainians cut down any looting and severely punish those who attempt to loot. In the case when shops are closed and food and water are urgently needed, Ukrainians take provision and leave money in these shops in return.\nA shop in Kyiv. The locals took water bottles leaving money in return.\nUkrainians also saved 25 paintings by the celebrated Ukrainian artist Maria Primachenko from being burned due to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. The works had been housed inside a historical museum in the town of Ivankiv, about 50 miles northwest of Kyiv. This city became a battlefield and, consequently, the historical museum was ruined. However, the paintings by Primachenko that were thought to be burnt were actually saved by the citizens of Ivankiv.\nNaturally, the biggest support of Ukrainians is sent to the Armed Forces. In January 2022, the charity fund \u201cCome Back Alive\u201d that supports our Army received more than 6 million hryvnias (approximately $207,381) donations. On February 22, after we found out about the intentions of Putin, this fund was overflowing with donations that reached 20 million hryvnias ($680,000). Currently, it is difficult to estimate the sums sent from Ukrainians that live all over the world to support the army. Ukrainian territorial defense also receives large donations.\nUkrainian free spirit\nAs I mentioned above, the response of 13 Ukrainian warriors to the Russian warship on the Snake Island became a symbol of Ukrainian resistance to Russian aggression. \u201cRussian warship, go fuck yourself!\u201d quickly transformed into \u201cRussian soldier, go fuck yourself!\u201d, \u201cRussian aircraft, go fuck yourself!\u201d, etc. The signs and billboards with this phrase are currently all around Ukraine and even in other countries.\nThe billboard in the Ukrainian city. It says \u201cRussian warship, go fuck yourself!\u201d. The picture is created by the artist Nikita Titov.\nThe billboard in Kyiv. It says \u201cRussian soldier, go fuck yourself!\u201d. It is located on my street.\nMotherland Monument in Kyiv surrounded by drones that say \u201cRussian warship, go fuck yourself!\u201d\nUkrainians are a peaceful nation, we don\u2019t want war. However, we definitely will not let Russia subjugate us. We will resist with all our hearts. As I already said in the previous articles, Ukraine will never ever be conquered by Russia. We are an independent nation. Referring to Yuval Noah Harrari, I\u2019d say that this national war \u201cis the stuff nations are built from\u201d.

I was enthusiastic to finally mingle and meet new people. (I couldn\u2019t remember the last time I had done that). One of the guests approached me and introduced themselves. Upon learning I am Egyptian American, they fondly shared their experience spending time in the Middle East. They didn\u2019t want to be a typical \u201cAmerican,\u201d so they spent much of their time getting to know the locals in Cairo. They were even more excited when I shared that I lead the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) portfolio at a prominent think tank in Washington, D.C. It was affirming to have a conversation with another professional that vehemently agreed that more must be done to prioritize DEI \u2014 and act upon it \u2014 in U.S. institutions. They criticized D.C. institutions specifically for being predominantly white and male despite the rich culture and diversity of the nation\u2019s capital. Everything seemed to be going great until they asked me for my name.\nI said: \u201cHadeil.\u201d\nThey responded bluntly: \u201cSorry, I cannot say that name.\u201d\nShock. Humiliation. Anger. They seemed \u201cwoke.\u201d They seemed to \u201cget it.\u201d Yet, they couldn\u2019t take a brief moment to learn how to pronounce my name.\nThis was not the first \u2014 and will not be the last \u2014 time I experienced this type of microaggression. For most of my life in the United States, I resented having such a \u201cdifficult\u201d name. I began to ask myself, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t my parents think through this?\u201d I wondered if things would have been easier if my name had been anglicized. I felt I couldn\u2019t make lasting professional connections because of my name. I felt alienated and othered. A student I mentored confessed to me that she changed her name to something more \u201cAmerican\u201d at a young age to avoid the same struggles I was facing. She now regrets masking her Latinx background. Who knew names could be such a source of joy for some but also a source of anguish and rage for others?\nIn his book How to Win and Influence People, Dale Carnegie shares: \u201cRemember that a person\u2019s name is, to that person, the sweetest and most important sound in any language.\u201d Using names has a positive psychological effect on people. Researchers found that hearing your own name shows greater brain activation, and people are typically more alert and attentive when they hear their name. Given this data, combined with my continuous frustration, I decided to take steps to make my life \u201ceasier.\u201d I edited my Zoom information to include my name and the phonetic pronunciation so that colleagues that join calls have the opportunity to see how my name is pronounced. I also added a feature to my email signature and LinkedIn profile so that colleagues can hear my name. These steps helped me unlearn my previous resentment, stop perceiving my name as a burden, and reconnect with my name and my heritage.\nNames are important because they comprise so much of our identity. In time, I came to remember that my name is a beautiful reminder of my story. I take pride in my name because it defines my own identity as an Arab American Muslim woman. It connects me to the love I have for my Egyptian heritage. My parents were intentional about picking unique names for my brother and me. I am grateful for that now.\nTaking these extra steps to help others say my name helped some. Even still, I continue to hear things such as: \u201cI just can\u2019t get it right, sorry.\u201d And even, \u201cYour name is not easy. I am not sure I will be able to call on you during the session.\u201d\nUnfortunately, it did not solve the issue at its core: carelessness and lack of sensitivity.\nCultivating and fostering a truly inclusive workplace means meeting each other at least halfway. In my case, I went out of my way to make my name easier for my colleagues. However, I cannot be the only one working to make things easier for others. And unfortunately, challenges with names tend to fall predominately on individuals from diverse, underrepresented, or marginalized identities. I know this from my own experiences as one of the few Arab American Muslim women within my own organization, and through the conversations I have with other colleagues of color and culture.\nAsking colleagues to disproportionately shoulder the burden of emotional labor does not make for a healthy, inclusive work environment. The good news is that there are easy steps everyone can take to appreciate and celebrate the diversity of their coworkers in a way that makes them feel seen and heard.\nHere is what you should avoid or ask your colleagues to avoid:\nAvoiding the person\u2019s name in a meeting/call. I have been in countless meetings where people decide to circumvent my name entirely to prevent making a mistake. The worst part is that they say everyone\u2019s name except mine. Your intention is not to get my name wrong, but the impact makes me feel unseen.\nMaking a point that my name is different. You don\u2019t need to state that you haven\u2019t heard this name before or how difficult it will be to get it right. This makes me feel \u201cothered,\u201d and that because my name is different, I too am different and thus don\u2019t belong.\nPublicly stating your opinion on my name in a group. \u201cInteresting name. I am not sure I will be able to get this one right.\u201d Some things do not need to be said publicly. You\u2019re doing so in a group setting makes me feel alienated.\nContinuously misspelling someone\u2019s name in email exchanges. Simply put \u2014 pay attention. Before sending any email, whether the person is a senior executive, a manager, or an intern, take the 10 seconds to make sure the spelling is correct. When you don\u2019t, it makes me feel dismissed.\nHow to be part of the solution:\nPay attention to how the individual pronounces their name. If it puzzles you, write down the phonetic pronunciation in your notes. If you mispronounce it, own up to it and do better.\nFollow up. If you forget how it is pronounced, say: \u201cI am sorry, could you please pronounce your name for me again. I want to make sure I get it right.\u201d Apologies and questions are always welcomed, but lack of effort or empathy are not.\nBe an ally. An old colleague and dear friend of mine would step in every time someone would ignore me in meetings. Her strategy was so tactful: \u201cThis question is within Hadeil\u2019s expertise,\u201d or \u201cI will let Hadeil step in here to share her thoughts.\u201d She made a point to emphasize the correct pronunciation of my name.\nBe self-aware. There is a time and place for everything. Limit any repetitive questions or comments about a colleague\u2019s name in group settings.\nMake an effort. It always goes back to doing the work. Regularly making mistakes demonstrates a lack of effort and care. It communicates an unwillingness to prioritize your colleagues and an inclusive work environment. It says a lot to me when some of my colleagues get it right after one or two times, while others continuously make pronunciation mistakes or completely ignore me in meetings. You are the problem, not my name.\nThe first step to creating an inclusive work culture is learning your colleagues\u2019 names. People respond more positively when they feel acknowledged and respected. It is proven time and time again that people are a lot more receptive in discussions when they are recognized. This is your responsibility as a peer, colleague, and \u2014 especially \u2014 as a manager.\nTo again quote Dale Carnegie, \u201cRemember my name and you add to my feeling of importance.\u201d We must see the value in using our colleagues\u2019 names. We must create a culture of belonging and not exclusion. I finally love and appreciate my name.

All Rights Reserved. via Visura\nWednesday, January 6, 2021, will forever be ingrained in many Americans\u2019 minds as a moment of societal failure, political divide, and domestic terrorism. For many, that same day also happened to represent a historical victory. It was the first time a Black man and a Jewish man were elected as Georgia\u2019s Senators. President Barack Obama stated on his Twitter account, \u201cMy friend John Lewis is surely smiling down on his beloved Georgia this morning, as people across the state carried forward the baton that he and so many others passed down to them.\u201d The fearless leader, Stacy Abrams, spent a decade organizing to increase the voter turnout among Blacks, Latinos, and Asians in the state of Georgia. Two different Americas clashed on January 6th. One America was eager to reckon with its racist history and uphold a true vision for social justice and equity. The other America was an alarming reminder of the country\u2019s well-alive racist, xenophobic, violent, and white supremacist history.\nAs I remain glued to the news, I watched Brian Stelter, on his show \u201cReliable Sources,\u201d state the following to a CNN correspondent: \u201cI mean you covered the Arab Spring, how did it feel to cover the events at the Capitol on Wednesday?\u201d These words come in the wake of many problematic statements journalists and politicians have asserted since the January 6 terrorist attack. CNN commentator, Van Jones, stated, \u201cwhere we\u2019re headed looks more like Syria than the United States of America.\u201d Senator Marco Rubio tweeted, \u201cthis is 3rd world style anti-American anarchy.\u201d As an American, I am well-aware of America\u2019s obsession with its role as the savior of democracy across the world. As an Egyptian American, I have also seen how that has played out in many countries around the Middle East.\nMr. Stelter, your words are insensitive to those who took part in the Arab Spring. These words are offensive and hurtful to the millions of Egyptians, Tunisians, and Syrians who took to the streets in 2011 to fight for bread, freedom, and social justice. They fought autocratic regimes that prevented them from voicing their opinion or even thinking about voicing their opinions for decades. Egyptians were fighting against a military dictatorship that silenced its people and stripped them from their basic dignity for 30 years. They were fighting for a better future for their kids and to end a legacy of severe government repression. These words go beyond the Arab Spring to the millions of Egyptians and Syrians who continue to be imprisoned, tortured, and killed by senseless regimes. These protesters are the true definition of \u201cpatriots,\u201d and the true fighters for democracy.\nAmerica should take the time to reckon with its own violent, white supremacist history. Eric Foner, an American historian, depicts America\u2019s long history with white supremacist violence at the heart of the Reconstruction Era in his book \u201cReconstruction: America\u2019s Unfinished Revolution, 1863\u20131877.\u201d We need to call out our own history: North Carolina in 1898, Oklahoma City Bombing in 1995, Dylan Roof in 2015, and the \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally in 2017 \u2014 just to name a few. What I ask of journalists, politicians, and political experts is to stop comparing Arabs and Muslims fighting for basic rights to the thugs that invaded the U.S. Capitol last week.\nWe must end US media coverage of \u201cthird world countries\u201d as barbaric and chaotic. These comments dehumanize the men and women who lost their lives fighting for a better Egypt, Syria, or Iraq. Labels, symbols, and words do matter \u2014 so let\u2019s get the facts straight. A group of white Americans waged a domestic terrorist attack on the U.S. Capitol. If you need to make historical analogies, use the many case studies in the U.S.\u2019s own history. America \u2014 we will move forward as a nation when we acknowledge our wins and our failures.", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 15, "created_time": 1610321970492, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Capitol Riot", "Media Criticism", "Middle East", "White Supremacy", "Cnn"]}, {"author": "Hadeil Ali", "post_id": "475149a00151", "user_id": "1c27a1287b8a", "title": "Is George Floyd America\u2019s Bouazizi?

Lafayette Park: D.C.\u2019s Tahrir Square\n\u201cBread, Freedom, and Social Justice.\u201d This is the Arab Spring\u2019s most memorable slogan. In 2011, Mohamed Bouazizi, a Tunisian street vendor, set himself on fire after being harassed by a municipal officer. His death ignited frustration, anger, and rage across the Middle East. Millions of Egyptians, Syrians, Libyans, and Tunisians chanted this slogan for weeks, demanding dignity from regimes that never afforded them any basic human rights. At the time, I thought it was a turning point in the history of the Middle East. With 2020 marking the 9th anniversary of these uprisings, I am forced to reflect on the millions in the Middle East who have yet to gain the rights their compatriots sacrificed their lives for.\nToday, though, I am also reflecting on the ongoing events that have taken over every state in the United States. George Floyd\u2019s death sparked rage similar to that in the Middle East in 2011, after he was murdered at the hands of a white police officer in Minnesota. \u201cSilence is Violence,\u201d \u201cHands up. Don\u2019t Shoot,\u201d and \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d are slogans Americans are chanting from Los Angeles, to Chicago, to Atlanta and D.C. I have been protesting at the White House for the past week to call out the systemic violence, that is perpetuated on a daily basis, and the murder of innocent black bodies.\nWhile anger in the Middle East stemmed from political failures, the rage in the U.S is rooted in anti-blackness and racism. There are well-defined similarities between both movements, despite differences in the social, economic, and political contexts of each region. Social media networks were a catalyst in mobilizing millions in the Middle East. Similarly, they have allowed millions of Americans to witness the double standards Black Americans continue to live with. Like in Egypt, the American people mobilized and spoke up, but social media platforms amplified this reach. In the case of Ahmaud Arbery, white officers buried the case until the video circulated online.\nPhoto by Hadeil Ali. Edits by Emily Tiemeyer: Lafayette Park, May 31st 2020\nIn D.C., Lafayette Park has become Tahrir Square. Both spaces have been used to share grievances, feel heard, and seek justice. American police and military forces have used tear gas and rubber bullets against their own citizens, like the military did in Egypt. Americans have taken over Lafayette Park to call out the injustices our government has been responsible for the past decades. Major cities in the U.S. have imposed curfew, like military regimes did in the Middle East. Police have arrested over 11,000 protesters across the U.S. in order to suppress the recent momentum. In 2011, the Egyptian regime imprisoned thousands of innocent people and many of them still have yet to face a trial. But there are positive comparisons too. For example, it is admirable how acts of solidarity occur during such adverse moments. Protesters have been distributing water, food, hand sanitizer, and face masks in Lafayette Park. It reminds me of when I saw protesters in Tahrir Square with garbage bags cleaning the streets and distributing food for those in need.\nIt is critical to realize that the U.S. is not immune to the issues of economic inequality and social injustice that plague other countries. The U.S. prides itself in its role as the savior of the Middle East and the protector of democracy. Leaders in the U.S. published statements expressing their pride in protesters in the Middle East for their acts of bravery and fearlessness. Whether these statements were genuine or not, these revolutions seemed distant to many Americans as they belonged to a region plagued by war, conflict, and strife. Today, the U.S. is reminded that it must reflect on its own history \u2014 to reflect on the culmination of years of humiliation, lack of trust in institutions, and lack of accountability for the police. Black men and women are harassed, dehumanized, and murdered with no repercussions. This is the story of Sandra Bland, Travyon Martin, Eric Garner, Breonna Taylor, and many others whose lives matter but their government showed them otherwise.\nPhoto by Hadeil Ali. Edits by Emily Tiemeyer: Lafayette Park, May 31st 2020\nThe U.S. needs to reeducate itself on its own history because it has failed millions of Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC). I hope this is a pivotal point in America\u2019s history like millions in the Middle East thought Bouazizi\u2019s death was going to be. The images and social media posts circulating give me some hope that the U.S. might change its ways. Everyone is watching, America. As you watched men, women, and children fight for basic human rights in the Middle East, everyone around the world is turning their attention to you now. Will you let George Floyd\u2019s death become a statistic? Will you resort to the same police and military tactics regimes in Tunisia and Egypt abused? Will you choose to embrace all communities in the U.S.? Will you domestically enforce what you preach abroad? Will Floyd become America\u2019s Bouazizi?

Her husband, the Liverpool soccer player Mohammed Salah, is a more common household name. Soccer is part of a collective identity in the Middle East, and Salah\u2019s exquisite soccer skills and applaudable devout Muslim background have captured the media\u2019s attention.\nYet it is his wife that calls for the spotlight. Magi, known to most as Salah\u2019s wife, holds many identities. She is a mother. She is Egyptian. She is a biotechnologist. She is involved in charities in her community. Yet for many audiences, she is first and foremost a modest, veiled woman. No matter how \u201cprogressive\u201d you are, you are intrigued. As argued by Robin DiAngelo, a renowned American author and educator, we have been socialized to hold implicit biases related to race, gender, religion, and other social issues. Due to the veil, you may be wondering about her level of conservatism. You are probably comparing her to other athletes\u2019 significant others. A famous video has been circulating after Liverpool\u2019s Champions league win with Magi and her husband on the field with Mecca, their daughter. Magi is seen next to Salah hugging him and expressing affection in a public space. More importantly, she is the one initiating this genuine affection at Anfield Stadium. For a Western audience, a Muslim woman with physical signs of religiosity through her veil may not be expected to express emotions in such public spaces.\nSports outlets such as US-based Soccer Stories published a video to unravel hidden secrets about Salah\u2019s \u201cmysterious\u201d wife. Although probably attempting to be inclusive, the reporter states that, \u201cMagi is not the typical footballer\u2019s wife\u201d showing footage of \u201cnormal\u201d celebrities\u2019 wives like Shakira, Georgina, and Antonella. Magi defies society\u2019s image of the \u201ctrophy wife.\u201d She also defies society\u2019s stereotypical expectations of a Muslim woman. She is modest yet powerful. She is private but visible. She is conservative yet present. Magi is an educated, powerful, loving, compassionate, and publicly present companion to her husband. Although Magi was briefly under the spotlight, she proved to observers that an athlete\u2019s wife does not need to adhere to certain physical requirements imposed by society. Through her Muslim identity, Magi has constructed a more sophisticated image of herself, which goes beyond the mere visual appreciation of soccer players\u2019 wives.\nLiverpool, a team that has been historically followed by British middle-class, has had a long-troubled history with racism and discrimination. Howard Gayle, Liverpool\u2019s first black player\u2019s career was defined by systematic racism in an all-white industry. Despite that, Gayle was seen as a vital member of Liverpool\u2019s 1981 European Cup-winning side. Similarly, Salah has also been adopted as Liverpuldians\u2019 Muslim brother and hero. By default, Magi has been accepted in the family as well. Therefore, Magi\u2019s veil has not sparked debate among British audiences. Many have argued Salah has been a positive ambassador for Islam, as the Liverpool chant goes \u201cif he scores another few, then I\u2019ll be a Muslim too.\u201d Brits\u2019 acceptance of Salah and his family is linked to his professional service to the team.\nBut Muslim exceptionalism is a dangerous trap for Western observers. That is, Westerners should not embody Magi and Mo\u2019s Muslim identity solely because they are \u201cserving\u201d a Western love for soccer. So, while I wish to recognize the beautiful warmth Salah has received from millions of fans, I hope this will not be short lived. I fear that, unconsciously, Salah and Magi\u2019s story is a story of exception rather than a genuine effort to revisit Western views of the Muslim community. Western audiences may accept Magi and Salah but also need to commit to accepting millions of other Muslims\u2019 narratives who may not benefit them but are also openly devout, open-minded, worldly, and complex human beings.\nI urge us to think of Magi\u2019s story as a story of empowerment and liberation. Her story is a counter-narrative to the Western construct of women\u2019s empowerment in the Middle East. The only stories heard and embraced in the West are those of Muslim women letting go of religious values and symbols. A woman who is highly educated, religious, and devout does not need to be saved. While I do not believe Magi\u2019s intention is to openly present herself as such, she naturally offers a counter-narrative that we are not used to seeing in Western spaces such as sports celebrities. Magi\u2019s story thus deconstructs a narrow image of agency for Muslim women.\nI urge soccer fans and others living in the West to learn from their own genuine humanization of Magi and Salah. Guide your minds to utilize this humanistic approach beyond famous figures. Don\u2019t make Gayle, Salah, or Magi\u2019s stories mere exceptions. Most importantly, use Magi to broaden your preconceived notions of Muslim women. Women\u2019s narratives in the Middle East are highly diverse and relate to many layered issues like social, cultural, and economic capital. I invite you to use Magi\u2019s story and the wide support her family has received as a counter-narrative to perceptions and expectations the West has of Muslim women.\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/hadeilali", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 15, "created_time": 1576769660162, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Muslim", "Soccer", "Identity", "Liverpool", "Women"]}, {"author": "Charlie Brown", "post_id": "345f89b5c871", "user_id": "cf67a9c9c8f0", "title": "Our Obsession With On-Demand Delivery Services Is Destroying Lives, Livelihoods, and Human\u2026", "content": "Our Obsession With On-Demand Delivery Services Is Destroying Lives, Livelihoods, and Human Interactions\nAll for groceries delivered in 30 minutes or less\nPhoto by Sofia Sideridou on Unsplash\nThere\u2019s something about sending a delivery driver to pick up groceries from a store 100 feet from my apartment that makes me feel\u2026icky.\nBut that\u2019s exactly what I saw the other day. Three separate Glovo deliveries arrived at my friend\u2019s apartment within the hour.\nSomeone had ordered a couple of bottles of beer from the shop across the street. Another, a dessert from a store a block away. A present was required so a bottle of wine turned up from the wine store 200 meters down the road.\nThis is how it is in this city, my friend told me. We need something, we Glovo it. Normally it arrives within 30 minutes or less. There\u2019s hardly a need to set foot in a shop ever again.\nThe pandemic made this sort of uber-fast delivery service the norm and people pounced on it, grateful to reduce their presence in stores and takeout restaurants (the fact that some poor bastard still has to work in the stores to fulfill our orders because they can\u2019t afford not to, is apparently by-the-by).\nThe pandemic issue aside, my ickiness may be well judged. These companies feed on our desire for convenience, actively destroy workers\u2019 rights, and are making billions in the process.\nAnd as always with late-stage capitalism, this is all at the detriment of many. Including you.\nBig profits = tiny wages, tinier access to rights\nLet\u2019s take Instacart as our example here. In 2020, they made $1.5 billion in profits.\nAnd yet Instacart shoppers \u2014 the people who will shop for your groceries and deliver to your home \u2014make on average $14.36 an hour. That\u2019s around half the average hourly wage in the US.\nThen there\u2019s Glovo. One Glovo driver spoke with dozens of others and discovered that once you take into account gas, maintenance, and all other costs, the average wage was just \u20ac5.33 an hour.\nBasically, super fast delivery service wages suck.\nEven more concerning is how some of these companies will fight tooth and nail for the privilege of eroding employee rights. In 2021, UK-based delivery service Deliveroo \u2014 a company whose drivers claim to make as little as \u00a32 an hour \u2014 won a legal battle against their drivers to be classified as \u201cworkers\u201d, which means they are not able to enjoy basic worker rights, including the right to unionize.\nBad news for Deliveroo drivers, but apparently great news for investors who saw Deliveroo shares rise 9% as the judgment came in.\nSee? It\u2019s icky.\nConvenience isn\u2019t good for you\nConvenience encourages unintentionality. Who needs to plan when you know you can Glovo a packet of cookies whenever the mood strikes you?\nConvenience is expensive. Those delivery fees add up, as do the spontaneous takeouts.\nMost importantly, convenience is a barrier to human connection.\nWhen it comes to a delivery service, the only human you\u2019ll see is your driver, to whom you may say a quick thanks. That\u2019s it.\nBut if you are lucky enough to live in an area with independent shops, it can become a pleasure to amble down a street, popping into stores as you go.\nBack in my wine store days, I had hundreds of Saturday regulars who would slowly make their way down our street. They\u2019d stop at the deli, the butchers, the greengrocers, and with us. Each transaction would take a few minutes or more because of the chat. Each transaction became a human connection. Yes, it took some time. But it wasn\u2019t just about that. It was about turning grocery shopping into a joyful experience.\nConvenience isn\u2019t always good for you, or your soul.\nEver been knocked over by a delivery driver?\nI have. Granted, it was a pushbike, but it was speeding down a pavement and it hurt like hell.\n50k Glovo drivers.\n110k Deliveroo drivers.\nAnd countless other Wolt, UberEats, Gopuff and other drivers, all trying to move as fast as they can because of targets and those shitty wages.\nSo accidents happen. A recent survey suggested that 42% of delivery drivers have been involved in a collision that has damaged their vehicles.\nAccidents are costly when you\u2019re barely making minimum wage. And there\u2019s always the risk of losing more than your bike or scooter. Thai delivery driver Maneewan had a collision with her scooter and a non-signaling lorry which resulted in her leg being amputated.\nAs she says in a recent article:\nFood delivery drivers have to race against the clock. When companies want money, they come up with delivery targets.\nAnd since we want money, we try to hit those targets.\nBut we only get about 30 baht ($0.90) per delivery, and if there\u2019s an accident, the loss is permanent.\nAll so we can have our Friday night treats in 30 minutes or less.\nSmall businesses and instant delivery services do NOT go hand in hand\nSome quick research into delivery service commissions showed their cut coming in at anything from 15\u201330%.\nFor small businesses, those sorts of commissions simply don\u2019t make sense and aren\u2019t worth it.\nMy wine store trialed working with Deliveroo but we quickly found we couldn\u2019t keep up with the inventory along with the day-to-day running of the business. And we made peanuts thanks to those high commissions, so there was little incentive to make it work.\nEventually, it had to go.\nIn many cases, instant delivery services are simply too expensive to make it worth it for small, independent businesses, especially for small stores and restaurants. As the Washington Post reported \u2014 restaurants are barely surviving. Delivery apps will kill them.\nIt\u2019s another matter for large companies. They have the (poorly paid) manpower to work with delivery companies. Which leaves the door open for them to dominate yet more of our lives than they already do.\nAfter a thousand-word moan about ultra-fast delivery services, I feel compelled to tell you that of course, I occasionally use them. And I know that for some people it has revolutionized their lives, particularly for the housebound, infirm, and the isolating masses.\nBut they could be better. A lot better. These companies could play fair, they could pay reasonable wages and they could cease campaigning for the erosion of workers\u2019 basic rights.\nAnd for those of us who are not housebound, we can play our part too.\nWe can walk or bike to that independent grocery store, taking a few minutes out of our day to enjoy some exercise, helping a small business out in the process.\nWe could slow down.\nLife isn\u2019t a race, and that goes for your grocery delivery as much as anything else.\nIf you liked this, consider subscribing to my free Substack Simple + Straightforward for subscriber-only stories on how to live on your own terms through simple, meaningful living.", "comment_count": 9, "like_count": 466, "created_time": 1646046394475, "comment": [{"user_id": "cf67a9c9c8f0", "comment_time": 1646046394475, "comment": "Thank you for sharing!"}, {"user_id": "ccb86a0c63b1", "comment_time": 1646935183527, "comment": "I avoid using Instacart as much as possible.

And I do.\nBut what gives richness to the simple living argument is when other people share their own experiences.\nAs I dive deeper into the simple living rabbit hole, I see brilliantly insightful comments on my stories about how readers are approaching simple living in their own ways.\nInsights that frankly, are too good not to share.\nHere are 23 of my favorites\nI just need birds and nature at this point \u2014 Livia Dabs RN,MSc\nMany, many people like Livia find a lot of purpose, contentment, and simplicity in rural living.\nI get it.\nWhenever I spend time at my brother\u2019s house, smack bang in the middle of nowhere, I feel calmer and quieter. There\u2019s a lot of joy to be found in nature, and that is scientific fact. It stands to reason therefore that many simple living advocates choose to live rurally, with all the peace that comes with that decision.\nHaving said that, personally, I\u2019m a city girl at heart. 90% of my time is spent in the hustle and bustle of big conurbations and I love them. I couldn\u2019t live a rural life full-time, it\u2019s just not me.\nIt\u2019s all about knowing what works for you, as Livia has done by moving to southern Spain. She needs birds and nature, I need people, grit, and 2 am pizza slices.\nLyra Blackwood also makes a similar comment (I\u2019m going to assume she lives rurally here), commenting:\nI couldn\u2019t give a toss about all those fancy city events and festivals\nFair dos, Lyra!\nAt the end of the day, life can be simple in both the city and the country, and everywhere in between. It\u2019s up to you.\nI have my dogs, my husband, my laptop, my coffee, and wine and I\u2019m all set \u2014 PJ Kaplan\nWhat I like about PJ\u2019s words (aside from they are unnervingly similar to all I need in my life too, minus the dogs, plus a running kit) is that this list is tiny.\nPJ says she needs just five things in her life to make her happy and content.\nThis is an example of how simple living is much more than just decluttering. It\u2019s not just about how many items you have in your home, it\u2019s also about how you decide to spend your time.\nAnother comment came from LenkaB who said:\nI want a simple life in nature with my family, working in the garden and caring for a few animals.\nSimilar to PJ, Lyra and Livia, Lenka knows what she wants. And the list isn\u2019t long.\nA short list = more focus + fewer distractions.\nIt took me time and experience to understand that a good life is the one that is simple, minimal \u2014 Shubhi Singh\nI don\u2019t know about you but growing up, I didn\u2019t even know simple living was even a thing. My parents, teachers, and society at large were far more concerned with me bossing my education, getting a \u201cgood job,\u201d climbing the housing ladder, and finding contentment in stuff.\nIt took me until my late twenties to start undoing a lot of what I was told would make me happy.\nAs Shubhi says, it takes time and experience to understand that a good life isn\u2019t necessarily one filled to bursting with whatever it is we\u2019re told we should fill our life with.\nA simple life is using 8 words, instead of 30 \u2014 Erwin C\nIt feels rather ironic to include Erwin\u2019s comment in a 2000-word article, but I loved this idea.\nWhat I took from Erwin is that a simple life is about cutting out all the noise, distractions, and useless bullshit we\u2019re all subjected to every single day.\nIt\u2019s about prioritizing.\nIt\u2019s about being quiet.\nYou may only use eight words instead of 30, but you\u2019re going to make damn sure those eight words are the most meaningful you can think of.\nThere are a few minimalists out there who play the game of getting rid of as much stuff as possible, but I find it\u2019s better to say, \u201cWhat is considered enough in my life that I can be content?\u201d \u2014 Sunshine Zombiegirl\nThere are some people for whom decluttering becomes a compulsion which can lead to serious deprivation. It\u2019s called Spartanism and it\u2019s not a Good Thing.\nBecause when decluttering becomes unintentional, it\u2019s no longer serving the purpose it was designed to.\nSunshine Zombiegirl hits the nail on the head. Simple living isn\u2019t about decluttering for the sake of it, it\u2019s about learning what is enough for you. That could be 100 items, it could be 10,000.\nGip Plaster reiterates this nicely:\nI\u2019m spending my day deleting things that don\u2019t belong in my life \u2014 and adding a few that do!\nPreach, Gip.\nA lot of simple living involves fighting what society says is \u201cnormal\u201d \u2014 Kailey Waal\nI feel ya, Kailey.\nNia Simone McLeod similarly laments:\nI fight for simplicity in my own life, but I wish I didn\u2019t have to.\nNot long ago, a friend of the family asked where I was living right now. When I explained that I\u2019ve got no permanent home because I travel to a new city every few months, they laughed in my face.\nIt didn\u2019t feel good.\nGranted, I know my version of a simple life is relatively extreme (although less so with the rise in digital nomadism) but it was still a stark reminder that if how we live doesn\u2019t fit neatly into society\u2019s boxes, a lot of the time we\u2019re up against resistance.\nUnfortunately, simple living can be complicated. It takes effort and gritty determination to carve out a simple space.\nHard work? Yes. Worth it? Absolutely.\nSlowing down can be better for your mental health \u2014 Carol Townend\nI\u2019m not a slow person. I am filled to the brim with energy. I used to deal with this by filling up my calendar, rushing around, always late, always out of breath.\nBut Carol has a point here. Slowing down is much, much better for you.\nBella Rose agrees, saying:\nLearning to slow down and enjoy the little moments has been monumental in improving my mental well-being.\nAnd Bai-Leigh Chapman | Valley Virtual Assistance commented:\nI often wonder what people are rushing for or towards.\nIt seems Medium readers have figured out that slowing down comes with some pretty awesome benefits. I need to listen to them.\nA quiet life is the best life \u2014 Scott-Ryan Abt\nPreach, Scott. Quietness is underrated.\nEven though I love spending most of my time in cities, I always look for havens in the midst of the bustle where I can shut my front door and bask in the quietness of my apartment.\nA quiet life isn\u2019t just about your home of course. It\u2019s also about how you spend your time. These days, I keep my social calendar to a minimum, only committing to engagements that fill me with excitement, not dread. And I try to live less with FOMO, more with JOMO \u2014 the Joy of Missing Out.\nAs Mike Lewis comments:\nMissing out on all those things that I don\u2019t want to do sounds like an ideal life.\nHe\u2019s right. Scott is right.\nA quieter life, filled with shit you love \u2014 not just tolerate \u2014 is where it\u2019s at.\nI am continually looking for ways to make my life even simpler! \u2014 Kim Baker\nSimple living is a continual process, as Kim is discovering. It took me a long time to understand this.\nLife changes, as do priorities. What you need for a simple life now might not be what works in the future.\nLiving simply is an ever-evolving process, one that goes way beyond decluttering a few bits that have been hanging around in your back closet for a few years.\nI have lived small in the US for a while now and it is so much less stressful \u2014 Mary Buckley\nMan, I love small spaces. I can write thousands of words about how much joy I get from small apartment living (indeed, I have).\nAnd I\u2019m not the only one. Mary loves them too it seems.\nBecause smaller living spaces mean lower bills, less cleaning, more money, more time, less stress.\nThis was reiterated by another comment from Suki Zo\u00eb:\nI moved into my current tiny house for what I thought would be 2 months tops. 2.5 years later, I\u2019m still here.\nTiny homes \u2014 and what they can do for your life \u2014 can become addictive, it seems.\nEverything in our home now has a purpose \u2014 Maria Rattray\nThe other day, I re-watched The Minimalists\u2019 film on Netflix.\nSomeone made the point on there that whenever we buy a shiny new thing (they were specifically talking about phones), the old thing it\u2019s replacing becomes a source of discontent. It becomes another item in the home that no longer serves a purpose.\nIt\u2019s why I love a home where everything has a point, even if the point is as simple as it looks good on the shelf and I like it.\nHomes like these often feel that they are filled with warmth and love without being overwhelmingly cluttered or mentally draining.\nWhen I finally put down roots again, I want what Maria has. A purposefully filled home.\nA handful of good friends, like five or less, can offer so much more than a hundred \u2018sort of\u2019 friends \u2014 GE McKerrihan\nGE McKerrian\u2019s comment is another great example of how simple living is so much more than just decluttering.\nUnderstanding the importance of good friendships is something I learned the hard way, and way too late in life. I\u2019ve always enjoyed a large group around me, often filled with people I barely know.\nThe older I get, the more I realize how unsatisfying so many of my social interactions were becoming.\nI\u2019m learning (slowly) to spend time with a much smaller group of better friends.\nAnd it\u2019s paying off.\nQuality things save time, money, and energy \u2014 Bassey BY\nThere is a famous quote that goes:\nBuy once, cry once\nIn other words, if you buy quality and the cost hurts a bit, you\u2019ll only cry over it once because you won\u2019t have to buy again.\nOf course, how much quality you can afford will depend on your financial situation and I\u2019m intensely aware that buying quality is not a possibility for a lot of people.\nBut if you\u2019re in a position where you can, then I say do it. As Bassey says, it will save you time, energy, and money in the long run.\nCheers for the reminder, Bassey.\nI\u2019ve definitely felt less bored and so much happier since simplifying my life a year ago \u2014 Melinda Craig\nI wrote recently about how a simple life doesn\u2019t have to mean a boring life, and I mean it.\nSimple isn\u2019t boring. Simple is anything but. Melinda knows it.\n\u2018Nuff said.\nI\u2019ve recently said f**k it & quit my cyber security job in Houston, TX & moved to the woods in Arkansas \u2014 Donna Taylor\nI HAD to include Donna\u2019s comment because I think it\u2019s so freaking cool when someone follows through with their plans.\nI\u2019d love to hear how this has played out for you, Donna. This must have taken guts!\n23 different people, 23 different experiences. Now it\u2019s your turn.\nWhat does simple living mean to you? Let me know in the comments.\nBecause the more we talk about simple living, the more chance we have of changing things in our own lives for the better. Of having a better standard of living at a lower cost. Of owning less but gaining more.\nOf living life on our own terms.\nSubscribe to my (free) Substack mailout Simple + Straightforward to receive stories, tips, and strategies for living a simple life.

They\u2019re always long and annoying and once I strike one thing off, three more magically appear at the bottom.\nEven more, I hate the silent to-do list.\nThis is a concept I recently came across and it blew my mind.\nIt goes a long way to explain why the likes of me, you, and everyone else finds living a simple life so tricky. And why our heads are always so busy.\nLet\u2019s get stuck in.\nThe silent to-do list is a killer\nThe term was coined by Japanese author Fumio Sasaki in his book Goodbye Things and goes like this:\nEvery item in your home and life needs to be taken care of or maintained. Each item will \u201csignal\u201d that to you, forcing you to create a silent to-do list in your mind.\nSome examples:\nDirty dishes signal you need to clean the kitchen.\nPlants signal they need watering or maintaining.\nClothes in the closet could spark guilty thoughts like why have you not worn me yet?\nA cluttered desk signals you need to tidy it before getting down to work.\nDirty clothes on the floor signal they need to be washed, dried, folded, and put away.\nMuch of this might never get written down on a physical to-do list but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not filling up your brain.\nEvery time you walk around your home, thinking I must clean that sometime / I must tidy that / I should put that away \u2014 that\u2019s the silent to-do list talking.\nYou could think that the solution would be to fill your physical to-do list with all these chores. But therein lies another problem. Long to-do lists are overwhelming, and can lead to procrastination and damaging thoughts about your ability to achieve and be productive.\nSo what do you do instead?\nEasy.\nCut the clutter, cut the list\nIt\u2019s simple math. Fewer items in your home, fewer items signaling to you, shorter silent to-do list.\nWant to silence the list? Go into \u201cvacation mode\u201d\nEver noticed how much clearer everything in life becomes when you\u2019re in a vacation home? Because it\u2019s not your place, nothing is signaling to you that it needs to be cleaned, maintained, or sorted.\nAnd your brain notices it.\nIt\u2019s more chilled out. It has the time and energy to focus on more important matters. Decisions are made.\nWhen I get home, I\u2019m going to find a new job / save more money / be a better person / no longer sweat the small stuff.\nThe problem is, \u201creality\u201d hits the moment you return home. Laundry needs to be done. The house needs to be cleaned. The kids need whatever it is kids always seem to need.\nAnd your ambitions to better yourself are shelved.\nI\u2019ve been a permanent Airbnb dweller for the last 18 months. One of the (many) reasons I decided to pursue the lifestyle is because I was tired of my silent to-do list taking over my life and my peace of mind.\nI couldn\u2019t stop thinking about everything I had to do in my house, my garden, my business. It was overwhelming and exhausting.\nNow, much of that has disappeared. Other than work (which is a lot quieter now it\u2019s just me and a laptop), a few chores, and commitments, I\u2019m free of it all.\nAnd I\u2019ve noticed it.\nI have more time on my hands now that I can fill with, well, whatever.\nCoffee. Writing. Meeting friends. Napping. Walking. Running.\nOK, I went extreme. You definitely don\u2019t have to sell your house and live in short-term accommodation to achieve the same effect.\nInstead, you can emulate that vacation-home-like state in your own abode. All it takes is jettisoning shit that unnecessarily adds to your silent to-do list, thus carving out more time for you, your kids, your family, your life.\nSimple living is made doubly hard by the silent to-do list\nSimple living isn\u2019t easy. Society tells you bigger is better. That you\u2019re not successful if you don\u2019t have the status symbols to prove it.\nThe pressure is immense.\nAnd that pressure is literally doubled by the silent to-do list.\nEvery time you introduce something new into your life, it costs you twice as much as you think:\nThe thing costs you money.\nThe thing adds to your silent do-list, thus is also an emotional burden.\nThis double-effect goes a long way to explain why living a simple life can be so tricky to maintain. Even the most minimal of us are tempted to buy items that, as it turns out, carry double the amount of weight in our lives. Not only is our physical space intruded upon, but our emotional space is too.\nIt also explains why trying to live more simply and with more intention is so important. Jettison stuff, half your silent to-do list.\nA short silent to-do list is magic\nWe all want to silence that I must do this this and this voice. It\u2019s annoying.\nKnowing what a silent to-do list is \u2014 and how to tame it \u2014 goes a long way towards keeping that voice schtum.\nYou might be surprised at how much your own silent to-do list weighs on you and how much calmer you\u2019ll feel when you minimize it. And it\u2019s easy \u2014 all you need to do to start is throw out one useless thing.\nAn easy solution for a pervasive problem? That\u2019s a win, in my book.\nSubscribe to my (free) Substack mailout Simple + Straightforward to receive stories, tips, and strategies for living a simple life.

And one particular problem I\u2019ve been mulling on for a long time is what makes it so hard to execute a simple life, even when we\u2019re desperate for it?\nThere is one reason I keep coming back to time and again.\nPeople listen to the noise around them.\nCut out the noise, ignore the haters, live a simpler life. Easy, no?\nWell, no. Not easy at all.\nBut not impossible.\nThe Noise\u2122 doesn\u2019t want you to have a simple life\nWhen I talk about \u201cThe Noise,\u201d I\u2019m really talking about society.\nWe live in a society that applauds money, wealth, status, consumption, and growth. Don\u2019t conform to that, expect hundreds of people constantly asking you why the fuck not.\nThen there\u2019s:\nHustle porn telling you that you can never work hard enough.\nThe glorification of busyness, keeping our diaries full of commitments we largely despise.\nSocial media telling us we\u2019re not \u201cliving our best life.\u201d\nUp to 10,000 advertisements a day blasting us in our faces telling us to buy this, that, and the other.\nMan, it\u2019s SO noisy. And it\u2019s keeping you in an infinite consumption loop because that, my friends, makes you profitable to companies that essentially rule the world.\nCutting through all that bullish bullshit in order to live a simple life takes guts, perseverance, and a questioning disposition.\nYou\u2019ve got to really want to cut through The Noise.\nLiving the simple life says no to pretty much anything (but that doesn\u2019t have to suck)\nLiving a simple life is just as more about saying no as it is about saying yes. And The Noise makes that hard to do.\nMost of what you say no to is all good stuff, but it\u2019s not very acceptable to reject in 2022:\nBusy schedules.\n70+ hour work weeks.\nShitty social engagements.\nCar and house upgrades.\nElectronic upgrades.\nAdd in a healthy dose of FOMO and FOPO (Fear Of People\u2019s Opinions) and the temptation to run back to the fold of your hectic comfort zone can become too much.\nSo how do you turn it around?\nRecently I saw someone use the phrase JOMO.

You\u2019ll have to forgive me if this isn\u2019t a new phrase \u2014 I\u2019m always late to the party \u2014 but I like it as a concept.\nBecause what you get when you say no to the noise is a whole lotta joyful things, like:\nMore time to sleep (if you\u2019re the type to glorify a lack of sleep then I suggest you read Ryan Holiday\u2019s recent story).\nMore time with friends, family, and community.\nMore money.\nMore peace of mind.\nMore chances to work on whatever side hustle, hobby or project you love to work on.\nMore time to simply be.\nIt\u2019s easy to forget all these lovely life-affirming things when you\u2019re tempted by that bar night or a new outfit or the iPhone 83s (or whatever model we\u2019re on now).\nI\u2019ve succumbed to the temptation enough times to know.\nBut keeping these ideas \u2014 and countless more \u2014 in mind can go some way towards cutting out that noisy, temptation-filled world.\nJOMO is real, and it comes armed with a good night\u2019s sleep for you.\nSo how do you cut through The Noise?\nEvery single person on this planet has different experiences and priorities so you better believe that there ain\u2019t no magic answer here.\nAll I can do is tell you some of the steps I took to shut out some of the noise and go from a debt-ridden 20-something to a simple living, 100 item-owning 30-something. (Sidebar: the 100 items thing is my bag because I live on the road, but you can live a simple life with much, much more. In fact, you probably should.)\nI consumed content that shows it can be done. I listened to hours of podcasts, read books, and found communities of people who were already living a dope simple life. I got inspired by them.\nI got stubborn. Every time someone said either to me, online or in the media that living simply was an unrealistic lifestyle, I dug my heels in further. I cleared out more crap and refused to replace it almost like a fuck you to anyone who had dared tell me it couldn\u2019t be done. I was determined to show that it could.\nConversely, I kept it quiet for a long time. Even though I was stubborn about cutting out The Noise, I knew my resolve could easily waver thanks to that damn FOPO. So for a while (especially at the beginning) I was careful about who I spoke to about my simple living choices.\nI used my gut \u2014 rather than other people\u2019s opinions \u2014 to determine what I was and was not prepared to spend money on. I performed a very non-scientific experiment on my expenditure spreadsheet, which basically amounted to whether the dollar amount spent in each category made me feel icky or not. If it did, I cut it out. If not, it stayed.\nI had a buddy to do it with me, namely my husband. Mastering a simple life is so much easier if you have someone alongside you doing the same thing. It could be a friend, family member, spouse, or even a relative stranger on the internet.\nThe Noise will always be there. It\u2019s up to you to block it out\nAlas, the world as it stands today will never not be noisy. We\u2019ve gone waaaaay too far down the rabbit hole for that.\nAnd not listening to it all is beyond difficult, especially if you have also sunk deep into that rabbit hole.\nI struggle with it all every single day. I worry about what my friends make of me, my parents, and strangers I meet, people on the internet, you \u2014 my readers.\nEveryone.\nAll I can say is, if you block out at least some of The Noise \u2014 just a smidge even \u2014 a simpler, calmer, quieter life can be yours for the taking. It\u2019s up to you to get your noise-canceling headphones out (as it were), block out the naysayers, and crack on with carving out your simple life.\nI\u2019m with ya.\nSubscribe to my (free) Substack mailout Simple + Straightforward to receive stories, tips, and strategies for living a simple life.

Art by Ernst Haekel (Kunstformen der Natur, 1904). This is the third installment of a series laying out a new ethical theory of green. This week we go far back to the primordial Earth origins of plastic \u2014 and lay out the groundwork for the theory.\nOVER 5 BILLION YEARS AGO, IN A SWIRL OF INTERSTELLAR DUST our solar system came together. As cosmic matter collided and coalesced, growing ever denser, our sun ignited. Assimilating the remaining debris, clumps of matter and momentum began to form, falling into orbit around our young star. On one such proto-planet, a particular pattern began to unfold \u2014 and the Earth came to be.1\nLike its neighbouring planets, the Earth had its own particular combination of mass, chemistry, orbit, moon and magnetosphere. And like its fellows, for its first two billion years, the Earth was a barren, desolate place. The atmosphere was full of carbon dioxide and the climate was harsh and unstable. The Earth\u2019s surface, was governed solely by raw geological cycles: the ebb and tide of tectonic plates, of ocean currents and atmospheric flows \u2014 planetary cycles with no vestige of a beginning and no prospect of an end1.\nAs these early Earthen cycles inexorably spun, the particular pattern of our planet began to unfold. For as the sun shone down, entropy demanded dissipation. Like the run of rain down a hillside, the Earth\u2019s cycles absorbed and adapted to the sun\u2019s energy in their unique Earthen way. New molecular configurations unfolded and new chemical combinations occurred, ever arranging themselves towards the improved dissipation of the sun\u2019s blaze. Steadily, large cycles fractured into a thousand smaller ones, and then those into a million more.\nAnd life emerged.\nAs life-cycles tended their spin towards ever better dissipations of energy, their matter spiraled into ever more complex and concentrated configurations. Steadily, cells cascaded into organisms and organisms into ecosystems.\nAnd things began to change.\nErnst Haekel (Kunstformen der Natur, 1904)\nPlants emerged and took over the planet\u2019s surface by sucking CO2 out of the air.2 They broke CO2 into it\u2019s oxygen and carbon atoms and used the latter as blocks to build. Plants began to compose leaves, flowers and towering trunks while other organisms discerned how to decompose them. Soon forests, fields and fungi covered the planet. Animals, algae and dinosaurs, all made from carbon blocks, emerged. As these amazing creatures lived and died, their carbon was cycled one into the other.\nAs time passed, one generation of fallen life was covered up by the next. Be it at the bottom of the ocean or the floor of a forest, surely and steadily, layers of life were buried under silt and sediment. Over hundreds of millions of years, the Earth compressed and compacted the biomass of these ancient organisms in a process of sequestration \u2014 indefinitely concentrating their carbon deep underground in secure deposits.\nAlthough these organisms all breathed out CO2, their lives tended to subtract more carbon into the ground than they added back into the air. With more and more organisms subtracting, soon great quantities of carbon were stored out of the atmosphere3. With more carbon being sequestered all the time, the Earth\u2019s climate stabilized \u2014 and life flourished!4 Unprecedented biodiversity over the last 65 million years enabled the calmest period in the planet\u2019s history.\n\nNever before had the biosphere been so livable and green. Cradled by the abundance,a variety of bipedal apes emerged from the forests. With the Earth\u2019s climate stable within 1\u20132 degrees, sapiens shuffled onto the scene .\nAnd we figured out fire.\nFirst, we started by burning wood to warm our caves. Then we discovered the Earth\u2019s carbon stores. We realized that they were far richer in energy. Some of us (but certainly not all) began to un-earth this ancient carbon \u2014 what we came to call coal, petroleum and natural gas. As we got better and better at extracting and burning, carbon came to heat our stoves, fuel our factories and power our machines. As it came to drive entire economies, we gave it a new name: fossil fuels.\nHowever, despite the nifty name, compacted carbon deposits were never meant to be fuel. In the process of refining petroleum, there was a left over residue (4\u201313% depending on the crude oil being used5) that just couldn\u2019t be used or burned. With nowhere to go, these chemicals began to pile up.6\nHumans soon realized, that the leftovers could be used to make stuff. With a little chemistry, polymers could be produced \u2014 and with a little more; an endless array of marvelous materials.\nPlastics had arrived!\nSoon, humans were solving all sorts of problems by making all sorts of amazing things. No longer did elephants need to be killed to make ivory billiard balls. No longer did you need expensive silver plates to take a photograph. No longer did food need to be shipped fresh. Plastics enabled more products, more value, and more capital to flow.\nPowered by abundant carbon energy, human industry grew and grew. As industry extracted and refined more and more petroleum for power, there was always that little bit that couldn\u2019t be processed. This led to industry producing more and more plastic at lesser and lesser cost. As industry expanded, so did petroleum refinement, capital surplus and the economies based on it all \u2014 the petro-capital economy.\nIllustrated are the changes in the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations over three time periods. The left plate shows long-term decreases in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels over the last 550 million years and the role of the biota in significantly decreasing carbon dioxide levels when plants invaded land. The middle plate shows the variations in carbon dioxide levels over the last 400,000 years. The right plate shows the imprint of humans over the last half century, increasing carbon dioxide levels significantly well above interglacial levels. \u2014 From A History of Atmospheric CO 2 and Its Effects on Plants, Animals, and Ecosystems, by James R. Ehleringer, M. Denise Dearing, Thure E. Cerling, University of Utah, 2005\nThe more the petro-capital economy grew, the faster industry spun and the more petroleum was extracted and refined. This made plastic so cheap and so abundant that it began to spill out and into the biosphere. Humans tried their best to manage their plastic by putting it back into industry. However, the economy already had so much cheap new plastic, that there was no-profit in recycling the old. It was easier to burn it, dump it or send it somewhere else.\nSoon there was so much plastic, that it became clear that dumping, burning, recycling and exporting created more problems than were solved. In order for the petro-capital economy to continue growing, industry tried hard to hide its ecological impacts and to convince itself and everyone else that there was a solution just around the corner.\nYet, after turning many corners, the grey flow into the biosphere continued to increase. There was now so much CO2 and plastic loose, that the ecological impacts were in dire dissonance with our longings for harmony. Shamed and determined, humans worked valiantly to improve their technologies, to make them less polluting and less damaging.\nBut still the grey flow continued \u2014 and grew. And so did our despair.\nWithin its respite, we took pause.\nAs it became clear that capital, technology and industry were not the solution, but rather the problem to solved we recalled our ancestors \u2014 those who had left the ancient carbon in the earth. They had made their choices following the example of the animals and ecosystems around them.\nPerhaps we could too.\nNext: Learning from the Earth\nThis is was the third installment in a series laying out a new theory of Green.

Together they track their household plastic and CO2 impacts. Their monthly household plastic consumption of 0.8kg/month is 14% of the Indonesian average. In 2020 their household CO2 emissions of 2046 Kg were 46.5% of the Indonesian per capita average. Meanwhile, their trees, bamboo, ecobricking and offsetting enabled them to secure 286% more CO2 (5851 kg of CO2 ) and keep 2200% more plastic out of the biosphere than they consumed (5.5Kg).

Photograph William Anders, \u2014 NASA Apollo Archive\nIts Time to Start Following the Earth\u2019s Example\nRecognizing the lead of kincentric cultures, the moment is nigh to follow the grand master of ecological enrichment\nby Russell Maier & Irene Bakisan\nOUR MODERN CULTURE is almost exclusively based the ways and wisdom of great human teachers. From philosophers to prophets, emperors to kings, scientists to seers, their insights, dictates and examples have developed the ways in which we discern good and bad, true from false, right from wrong \u2014 and, quite unconsciously, imbued our modern view of the world with a focus on human needs and human well-being. However practical this has been for making sense of human living, however successful it has been at achieving the prosperity of human civilization, it has utterly failed to achieve the ecological integration we so long for today. As we saw in our last chapter, this is particularly clear as we recognize the ecological integration of those cultures that were able to learn from non-human teachers. The contrast between the ecological enrichment wrought by such kincentric cultures and the ecological denigration wrought by human-centric society is as stark as it is revealing.\nFrom the vantage of our the Earth\u2019s four billion year story, it is now abundantly clear that humans are not in any way central-to or separate-from the biosphere. Rather, we are as interconnected and dependent as all our fellow earthen organisms. And likewise, it is also now clear: when it comes to enriching ecological integration, human-centric ideologies are fundamentally inadequate.1\nHowever, just as our anthropocentricism begins its shatter, we can at last see that another great teacher awaits us!\nAnd we have no further to look than our feet.\nFor too long we have assumed the Earth beneath us to be a static and stable constant. From our all-too-human view of the world, we have seen the Earth as an unmoved mover, a separate thing, an unconditioned solid and central constant.2 In fact, it is anything but! The coalescence of cosmic matter and energy that has become the Earth has in fact never ceased unfolding. The ongoing result of a vast stellar confluence, the Earth\u2019s array of elements, solar distance, spin, orbit, moon and magnetosphere compose a pattern of process utterly unique in our solar system .\nIndeed, in our entire galaxy we know of no other entity that has been so successful in managing its matter and energy to manifest the very ecological enrichment to which we so aspire today. Truly, the Earth\u2019s transformation of our once barren planet into a thriving biosphere is the penultimate example of ecological contribution.\nJust as ancient and ongoing kincentric societies observed and learned from the character of kindred creatures that mastered their ecological integration with particular magnificence, so too can we observe and learn from the Earth.\nWith our view of the world debugged of human-centric bias, we can at last begin to grasp the cosmological character of our common home. As our scientific and kincentric knowing come into resonate, we can begin to discern with confidence an underlying pattern in the Earth\u2019s ways.1\nIn particular, by surveying the planet\u2019s shift over the eons from grey to green we can observe six principles that underlie its pattern of processes:\nObserve how the Earth\u2019s processes tend towards spiraling cycles.\nObserve how the Earth\u2019s cycles tend towards the outwards dissipation of energy.\nObserve how the Earth\u2019s cycles tend towards the inwards concentration of matter.\nObserve how the Earth\u2019s cycles tend towards net-subtraction of matter into geological storage.\nObserve how the Earth\u2019s cycles tend toward the net-addition of biological diversity.\nObserve how the Earth\u2019s systems tend towards ever greater consciousness of their interconnection.\nFrom organism to ecosystem, from biome to biosphere, we are surrounded with the verdant consequences of these Earthen principles applied. Whether the process is minute or massive, ancient or ongoing, in looking closely, we can see the same Earthen ways reflected and embodied \u2014 a microcosm of the macro within every organism and ecosystem. Within the the life-cycles of everything from a forest to a tree, a bird to a flea, we can observe the tendencies of the Earth\u2019s character expressed in each and every one \u2014 together forming a vast symphony of a trillion instruments all tending their tune towards a more resilient, livable and abundant biosphere for all.3\nWhile there are hints of these tendencies upon other planets \u2014 upon ours, they definitively incline the cycles of matter and energy, setting the Earth apart in their clarity of verdant expression and green consequence.\nYet, the Earth is not alone in the uniqueness of its planetary pattern. Around the solar system, the unique stellar confluence of each planet, has given each it\u2019s own unique cosmological character. From the endless storms of Jupiter to the endemic volcanoes of Venus, to the color of Mars, each planet\u2019s character tends towards its own unique expressions of surface, ocean and atmosphere.\nThough, let us note that such planetary tendencies are not hard and fast rules. Not all storms on Jupiter turn to giant rusty spots, not all Venusian mountains erupt, nor are all Martian rocks red. Likewise, not all of the Earth\u2019s cycles express Earthen tendencies with equal clarity and consequence4. In this way, over the eons, certain Earthen organisms and ecosystems have come to express the Earth\u2019s tendencies more than others.\nImages compiled of the Jupiter\u2019s Great Red Spot taken by Voyager 2 on July 8 1979. NASA/JPL-Caltech/Kevin M. Gill\nIn the next six chapters, we shall examine six Earthen phenomena that have attained an exceptional magnificence in their expression of one of the six Earthen ways. With the assistance of kincentric insight, physics, biology and astronomy we will examine the ways of the Igorots, the cycles of the Salmon, the manner of Mollusks, the age of the Carboniferous, the biodiversity of ancient oceans and the consciousness of a mycorrhizal forest. Each shall aid us in discerning the essence of a particular Earthen principle, and together reveal the full character of ecological contribution.\nWhat we call an Earthen ethics.\nUsing Earthen ethics, we can then confidently discern and define what is green (what is an ecological contribution) and what is grey (what is not). What is green is that which embodies the six Earthen principles and leads to a more hospitable, resilient, vibrant, abundant and conscious biosphere. What is grey is that which conflicts with any one of the Earthen principles, leading to the opposite \u2014 lowering consciousness, reducing biome abundance, vibrancy and hospitality, and decreasing resiliency.5\nThen just as kincentric societies fast tracked their ecological integration, so too can we.\nWith the correlation between Earthen principles and consequences clear, we are availed a new and commanding clarity. We are assured that by embodying the Earth\u2019s ways in our own processes, they will have like greening consequences.\nWith a humility born of despair delved and pride shattered, we can then move on from our modern grey ways. We can at long last align our longing to contribute to ecological enrichment with tried-and-tested parameters for its realization.\nThen, with a renewed perspective of our planet and our place on it, we shall return to our plastic.\nAs the representative of our last century of carbon play and the embodiment of human-centric thinking, it has a key role to play. With the application of each and every Earthen principle to the processing of our plastic, Banayan and I have come to see that what was once an inevitable pollutant can be transmuted into an inexorable enrichment.\nAnd in so doing, show the green way forward for our other processes, materials and enterprises.\nBanayan Angway and Russell Maier, an Igorot wisdom keeper and a western philosopher, met ten years ago to protect the Chico River in the remote Northern Philippines from an inundation of plastic pollution. Ever since, their exploration of the modern relevance of kincentric wisdom has steadily unfolded. They are now publishing a treatise of their insights as a comprehensive theory of green and grey.

We took a look at the problems with the human centric view of the world in our preface. We\u2019ll be coming back to make an examination of the human-centricism a chapter of its own.\n2. Much as a computer is upgraded with a new firmware to avail of new opportunities and fix old bugs, so too can we upgrade our view of the world. But the old board need not be discarded! The chips and processors of science and reason, can be repurposed accordingly.\n3. It is important to note that the Earthen principles do not lay any claim to why or how the Earth came to its cosmological character. We are simply observing the net change of the planet from its barren state to its biosphere state. Whether the principles themselves were laid by coincidence, a divine being, many beings, or a sentient planet is a separate matter entirely. Likewise, the great plunges in diversity, stability and consciousness (i.e mass extinctions) that seem at odds with our principles \u2014 these are separate from our observation of net consequence of the singular Earthen process.\n4. It is much the same way that a crystal grows. The particular chemistry and conditions of a crystal tend it toward a particular expression of geometry, color and clarity. In this way, most selenite crystals grow several centimeters in length. However, given the right conditions they have been found at over 10 meters in length. See: The Cave of Crystals in in Naica, Chihuahua, Mexico.\n5. As described in chapter 5, we view the Earth as a whole, self-contained, planetary system in which human system are subset. In this way, when we allude to \u201cfollowing the Earth\u2019s example\u201d we do so with particular mindfullness of the \u2018naturalistic fallacy\u2019 (\u201cbecause it is natural to do things a certain way, we ought to do things that way\u201d). While this fallacy certainly pertains to is/ought arguments between two different systems (i.e. \u2018the human world\u2019 and \u2018the natural world\u2019), the naturalistic fallacy loses in relevance when one system is acknowledged to be the subset of the first. In such a case, a three part is/ought/if\u201d statement is possible: in order for the whole system to function in its characteristic way, its part ought to embody a certain characteristic of the whole if it is to work as it should. For example: we can observe the hands of a clock face go around in sequenced circles; and posit that so ought its gears if it is to keep time. Likewise we can observe that a tree removes carbon from the air; and posit that so ought its leaves if the leaf and tree are to thrive. Consequently, the careful reader of the will observe our categorical avoidance of the dichotomy of \u2018natural\u2019 systems and human systems (never once do we use the term \u2018nature\u2019 in this way).

Rather than depleting the ecosystems of which they were part, these societies steadily enriched them. Rather than moving on to new lands and resources, these cultures made a common home with the organisms around them. As they did so, these cultures got to know ever better the ecology in which they were immersed to develop a practical wisdom for maximizing their ecological integration. Today, as we strive to ensure that our modern enterprises are green, we have much to learn from the way these cultures knew their world. In fact, Banayan and I have come to see that integrating their way of knowing is a fundamental requisite to an ethic of green.\nFour centuries ago, the first Europeans began to explore the Americas. From the 1490\u2019s to the 1790\u2019s, they found themselves in awe of the tremendous ecological diversity and abundance that they encountered. On the Pacific West Coast of North America, for example, the first Europeans documented rivers overflowing with salmon, forests teeming with game, trees of colossal size, and coastal shoals overflowing with marine life.\nHowever, like other explorers of the time, their observations of human habitation were tainted. As we saw in our preface, the biases of their world view restricted their observations of the societies they encountered as much as the mountains and thick forest limited their routes1. But perhaps most significantly, the first explorers did not realize that they were observing the remnants of collapsing societies that had been devastated by disease. In some cases populations had been reduced by 90\u201395%2. Consequently, the early explorers, and their colonists to follow, attributed the stunning ecological abundance to the power and potential of \u2018nature\u2019 undisturbed3 \u2014 even if deep down they suspected otherwise:\n\u201c\u2026the country before us exhibited every thing that bounteous nature could be expected to draw into one point of view. As we had no reason to imagine that this country had ever been indebted for any of its decorations to the hand of man, I could not possibly believe that any uncultivated country had ever been discovered exhibiting so rich a picture.\u201d \u2014 Captain Vancouver\u2019s observations of the Pacific Northwest Coast, May 2nd 17924\nHowever, it is evident now that the Americas, shortly before the arrival of most European explorers, was home to hundreds of independent nations and, on the whole, tens of millions of people5. With the populations of some Mesoamerican cities in the hundreds of thousands, nations easily had the potential to exhaust the carrying capacities of local ecosystems6. Indeed, it is now widely recognized that these first nations had sophisticated gathering technologies, and had long attained the skills to over-fish, to over-hunt and over-cultivate the ecosystems around them7. They also had the destructive potential. War and raids, the taking of slaves and heads, the destruction of towns and cities were not uncommon occurrences.\nBut despite their technology, population and destructive-capacity, over-consumption and ecological exploitation did not occur.\nIn fact, quite the opposite.\n\nToday it is becoming increasingly clear that the startling ecological vitality of the time was not due to a lack of indigenous population, skill or technology. Rather it was a consequence of it \u2014 the culmination of centuries of mindful and masterful human ecological integration. Modern research shows that these fields and forests8, shoals9and shores10once presided over by various first nations, are today demonstrably more verdant, productive and biodiverse than adjacent, \u201cnatural\u201d, or un-managed ecosystems11.\nInterestingly enough, despite the vast disparities of politics, beliefs and identity among these first nations12, they nonetheless shared a consistent ontological view of the world. Much as the various European colonial nations shared certain fundamental precepts (such as Greco-Roman myths and metaphysics that we alluded to in our introduction) so too did the network of first nations spread out across the continent three hundred years ago11. In a similar way, first nations held their own underlying myths and metaphysics. In particular, a view of the world in which human and animal, bird and plant were members of a common family.\nThis ontology differed fundamentally from the view of European explorers and their colonists of \u2018nature\u2019 as fundamentally distinct from the human. Such a hard and fast dichotomy was entirely absent in the first nation perspective\u2013 their view of the world had no concept of humans as separate to the world around them. Nor did they have any notion of man\u2019s centrality and superiority to the \u2018natural world\u2019. Instead these first nation cultures saw the plants and animals around them, quite literally as kin\u2013 a community of beings that share ancestry and origins13. Indeed, the word \u201cnature\u201d \u2014 as it occurs in our modern cultures that inherit much of the views and values of its colonial roots \u2014 is entirely lacking in most indigenous languages.14\nThis \u2018kincentric\u201915 world view, enabled a wholly different way of ecological knowing than we are accustomed to in our modern cultures.16\nWithout a conceptual divide separating themselves from the creatures around them, many first nation cultures articulated their relationship to animals and plants as that of a younger brother to an older or as a granddaughter to a grandmother. Then, just as one learns from a distinguished elder, these cultures paid special attention to those particularly distinguished organisms around them. Creatures that, in elegance, ingenuity and beauty had most magnificently mastered their ecological integration.\nToday, we can appreciate the accuracy of the analogy.\nIn the same way that brother and sister, grandson and grandfather are parts of a larger family, so too are plants and animals subsets of an ecological system \u2014 just as are humans. Likewise, in the same way that forests and reefs are subset systems of larger biomes, so too are human communities and economies. Consequently, plants and animals, forest and reefs, having had millions of years longer than humans to adapt and integrate into larger wholes, have invaluable systemic adaptions for humans to learn from.\nIn this way, a salmon or an eagle, a toad or a tree, all embody the culmination of hundreds of millions of years of evolutionary trial and error \u2014 the result of innumerable attempts and optimizations to integrate within a particular ecosystem. In comparison, the first humans to settle in the Americas (only several tens of thousands of years ago!) were newcomers \u2014 ecological young-lings who had much to learn from their elders.\nAnd so they did!\nAs the earliest Americans lived among the cycles of migration, death and birth of the creatures around them, they observed. Patterns were discerned, characters noted and principles were posited. These insights were passed down generation to generation, ever increasing the ecological awareness of the community. Often a tribe, resonating with the character of a particular creature would adopt it as their representative and guide. Almost all North American first nation clans took an animal \u2014 such as the wolf, raven, elk and beaver \u2014 as their representative, or totem.17 They were guided by the animal\u2019s ecological example as it was embodied in myths that expounded particular principles, vices and virtues18.\n\nLearning the art of earthen integration from such ancient masters, these societies were able to weave ecological wisdom into the fabric of their language, grammar and values19. In so doing their were able to by-pass the tedious, million-year process of evolutionary trial and error and dramatically fast forward their ecological awareness and integration.\nWhile societies elsewhere inclined towards the eminence of human needs, these kincentric societies continued to incline towards ecological enrichment.\nWhile other societies moved outwards to subjugate ever more resources and land, these kincentric societies made do with what was at hand.\nWhile other societies centered their culture upon themselves, these kincentric societies centered around the life cycles of the creatures they admired \u2014 the migration of geese, the return of salmon, the coming and going of the whales.\nAnd precisely because these life-cycles remained, so could they continue to learn from them.\nIn a spiral of ever deeper knowing, awareness and consciousness, kincentric cultures grew ever more in sync with the ecosystems around them. With the momentum of millennia of compounding insights, their epistemology steadily led to an ecological understanding of unparalleled lucidity. Steadily, humans were able to co-create with plants and animals a common home for all to thrive.\nToday, as we strive to green our modern culture and enterprises, the recognition and integration of the kincentric way of seeing and knowing is essential.\nThis way, can we too can see plants, animals and ecosystems as our ecological elders.\nThis way, with their partnership and guidance, we too can fast forward our ecological integration.\nAnd this way, we too can choose a guide and follow a master.\nNEXT: Chapter 6 | The Ways of the Earth\nPREVIOUS: Chapter 4 | The Earth\u2019s Pattern of Process\nRussell Maier and Banayan Angway, a western philosopher and Igorot spokeswoman, met ten years ago to protect the Chico River, in the remote Northern Philippines from an inundation of plastic pollution.

Photo: R. Maier.\nThe Earth\u2019s Pattern of Process\nRather than be mired in self-judgment at our play with carbon, we can be dazzled by the Earth\u2019s.\nOVER THE LAST FOUR BILLION YEARS, the singular combination of our planet\u2019s orbit, spin, chemistry and magnetosphere have played out. As this unique configuration of matter and energy has unfolded, a once barren rock has transformed into the thriving biosphere that is our common home today. Of all that we know of other planets in our solar system and galaxy, it is an extraordinary and epic story. However, what makes the story even more remarkable is that the tellers of the tale are thoroughly part of it.\nIndeed, as we saw in our last chapter, our telling of the Earth\u2019s tale is only possible through a vast and unique confluence of matter and energy: the whirl of stellar dust into the formation of the sun; the coalescence of the planets and the Earth around it; the spiral of carbon into ever more concentrated and complex Earthen configurations, the dispersion of the sun\u2019s energy into ever more diverse organisms and ecosystems; and the slow and steady cultivation of life\u2019s consciousness of its own interconnection.\nOnly through this epochal unfolding, can we look out with vast vantage upon the Earth\u2019s story and truly grasp our own. Only from this vantage can we truly understand the carbon that passes as plastic through our hands today and the fossil fuels that power our modern economy. And only with this understanding can we see through our despair at the seemingly intractable ecological denigration of modern civilization.\nRather than be mired in self-judgment at our modern play with carbon, we can be dazzled by the Earth\u2019s. The way our planet \u2014 as a uniquely configured system \u2014 has managed its matter and energy has led to the steady greening of its surface; the cultivation of ever greater diversity, vibrancy and abundance of life1. And finally, through the resulting emergence of consciousness, we Earthlings have been propelled to the telling and pondering of the story itself.\nSo, where do we go from here?\nFirst, let us hold fast to our vantage and the vast view it affords! From here we can observe another pivotal planetary phenomenon. Aside from some meteor strikes and massive volcanoes, it is a phenomenon unseen on the planet for hundreds of millions of years.\nBecause of the doings of much of modern humanity, never before has the Earth\u2019s atmospheric carbon count jumped upwards so quickly2. Never before have there been processes that so rapidly added more loose carbon into the biosphere than they were able to subtract into concentration.\nThe ensuing ecological disturbances directly challenge our last century of blissful carbon play.\nIt\u2019s all a little familiar.\nIf you\u2019ve ever seen a child at play with blocks for the first time, you will recall that the results are remarkably the same. After the thrill of assembling a grand creation, when the pieces tumble down, when the results aren\u2019t as intended, the upset youngster invariably blames themselves and the blocks.\nOf course, neither are to blame! Only through that first play can the child grasp the goal of the game.\nThere is no other way.\nLikewise, our disruption of ecological cycles is not a consequence of our \u2018nature\u2019 any more than it is the nature of carbon.3 Rather, the pattern by which our processes have managed their energy and their matter have been in dissonance with that of Earth\u2019s.\nAs we saw in our last chapter, for most of modern humanity, our processes have increasingly intended patterns of energy and matter that have dispersed carbon, concentrated energy, reduced biodiversity and stifled ecological awareness. In sharp contrast, the Earth\u2019s processes have inexorably tended towards the concentration and subtraction of carbon, the dispersal and of energy, the increase of diversity and the cultivation of consciousness. Whereas our modern pattern of process has degraded ecosystems, the Earth\u2019s has enriched them \u2014 making them ever more vibrant and abundant.4\nLike a despairing and determined child on a second-go at block-building, we\u2019re trying harder than ever before. With a shame at our failings, we have our heads down, striving valiantly to make our processes less polluting, less damaging, less grey. However, with the underlying pattern of our processes unchanged, even if they are less harmful, harmful they remain. With our industrial processes and economic enterprises on the whole ever more widespread, our polluting and greying ever increases.5\nBanayan and I believe it is time to raise our heads from the toil \u2014 and in particular the judgment. Again, rather than despair, we can be awed.\nOur once-in-a-million-years phenomenon of additive carbon usage is in fact a tremendous opportunity.\nFor the first time, with our usage of carbon as a foil, the difference between our modern human-ways and the ways of Earth\u2019s can be observed in unprecedented clarity. In the stark contrast of patterns, we can begin to clearly discern the spiral geometry that has underlaid the Earth\u2019s transformation of a barren planet into a thriving biosphere: the principles in which the Earth\u2019s biomes, ecosystems and organisms of each contributed towards the enrichment of all.\nBut perhaps most significant of all, through a clarity that only comes from scrapping the depths of destruction and despair, our modern gaze can now recognize those societies, before unseen, that have long found resonance with the Earth\u2019s patterns and principles.\nSocieties that long ago perfected their play with carbon and mastered their ecological integration.\nSocieties that instead of building castles for some, cultivated common homes for all.\nMuch like the planet we all share.\nNEXT: Chapter 5 | Another Knowing\nPREVIOUS: Chapter 3 | Plastic\u2019s Stellar Story\nWHAT IS THE TRACTATUS AYYEW? The Story\nFollow on Earthen\nFootnotes\n1 Going forward we will frequently refer to the Earth as a proper noun implying agency (i.e. \u201cthe Earth managed its energy\u201d). While it is more than possible to conceive the Earth as a sentient entity, a divine being, or the active creation of a divine being(s), such claims are far beyond the scope of this essay. Instead, we imply agency simply in as much as any self-contained system has its own unique patterns and \u201cway of doing things\u201d \u2014 as we speak of a clock \u201ckeeping time\u201d or a leaf \u201ctransforming sunlight\u201d.\n2. \u201cThe present atmospheric content [of CO2] exceeds anything Earth has experienced in the last million years and possibly the last 20 million years\u201d David Beerling, (2007), The Emerald Planet, Oxford University Press.\n3. David Attenborough and others have described humanity as a unique \u201cplague\u201d upon the planet. Within this view of humanity, resides the assumption that ecological denigration is \u2018human nature\u2019. We observe this to be an extreme form of antropocentricism (i.e. humans are unique among all other earthen organisms species in that they destroy rather than enrich the biosphere). We believe that from an indigenous, historical and scientific perspective this assumption is flawed and its repudiation is the main thrust of Tractatus Ayyew.\n4. Here and throughout the Tractatus, we refer to the cumulative four billion years of the Earth\u2019s history. Over the full period of the Earth\u2019s history, there have been tremendous swings in the abundance and diversity of life on the planet\u2013 times of extinction where for millions of years life was severely stifled. However, on the whole the net-biodiversity of the biosphere has steadily increased. We will fully examine this phenomenon and the pioneering biodiversity survey of paleontologist Joseph Sepkoski in Chapter nine.\n5. Hope is often placed in increases in efficiency to decrease the cumulative negative impact of a technology (i.e. \u201cmore efficient coal powered steam engines will decrease London\u2019s pollution\u201d). However, the Jevon\u2019s Paradox shows that over history, advances in technological efficiency have resulted in increased ecological impact. As efficiency increases, so too does the adoption and spread of the technology, inevitably erasing any efficiency gains.", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 25, "created_time": 1648177965090, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Philosophy", "Environment", "Earth", "Ecology", "Regeneration"]}, {"author": "Andrew Tanner", "post_id": "4c46c0ae6a62", "user_id": "869f66f3cda", "title": "Living Climate Change: Waiting For My Childhood Home to Burn", "content": "Living Climate Change: Waiting For My Childhood Home to Burn\nIt is now very likely my parents\u2019 home will burn down in the next few years.\nAll the beautiful green places, everywhere I walked as a kid, all the trees I saw grow up from saplings to maturity \u2014 poof, roasted to ash.\nThanks, climate change. By the gods do I feel this xkcd comic:\nxkcd 2500\nWhen my parents settled on ten acres of forest an hour from the nearest small city in far-northern California, wildfires were a always risk, but a manageable one.\nWith hard work you could keep your risk low. Fires in the past crept along, and homes properly cared for were often spared or could be protected by firefighters.\nStill, some fires are just too big to beat and you can\u2019t risk it trying to defend your home all alone, so growing up in the 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s every summer my parents and I \u2014 my severely autistic brother isn\u2019t exactly helpful in these matters \u2014 went through the same drill.\nWe packed go-bags and practiced hitching up the horse trailer, discussing who would get the dogs into which truck and what to do if we didn\u2019t have time to get panicky horses into their wheeled metal boxes.\nNow, you might be thinking wow, wish I had grown up with land and horses, but we were far from wealthy. Dad was a Navy veteran who managed his parent\u2019s small neighborhood grocery store. Mom did bookkeeping for the business. We rigorously clipped coupons, saved cash for the once-yearly vacation to the foggy coast, and took the horses for two-week trips in the wilderness to hunt elk and deer.\nIt wasn\u2019t that hard to afford 10 acres of forest an hour from civilization back in the 80\u2019s. After all, there were few public services to speak of. On the plus side, once upon a time you could ride a horse freely for dozens of miles down dirt roads \u2014 not a California most people know exists.\nIn a mixed oak, fir, and pine forest with a mediterranean climate fires were always a concern in hot summers. Add to that steep slopes well-watered in the rainy months and you\u2019ve got a recipe for some pretty intense fires.\nBut they\u2019re different now. The megadrought California in has dried everything out so badly every season but deep winter is fire season. And when fires get started\u2026 they rage.\nMy father, incidentally, after American capitalism killed the family store, went on to a second career as a forest service wildfire firefighter (in his fifties no less). And these fires scare him. They simply didn\u2019t used to be this bad \u2014 whole communities like Paradise burned to the ground, dozens dead.\nBut they are now. And that\u2019s not gonna change any more than Covid-19 is going to suddenly go away.\nParadise is only a few hours south of my family home. The Dixie Fire, now California\u2019s largest single fire, has burned from the outskirts of Paradise north to Lassen National Park \u2014 more or less my childhood backyard.\nThe Dixie Fire as of August 12, 2021. Not the one fated to take out my family home, thankfully.\nThe Dixie Fire burn area is 2/3 the size of Rhode Island and the fire is maybe 1/3 contained, with no weather relief in sight. It started near Paradise and has burned a distance it would take hours to drive.\nAgain \u2014 thanks, climate change.\nOr to put it more precisely: thanks suburbanite white people of American and European consumer culture over the past 70 years.\nThe graphic below assigns responsibility quite nicely \u2014 remember that the USA\u2019s population has been around half of Europe\u2019s and a quarter of China\u2019s, for most of this period.\nFrom Our World in Data\nSo thanks, suburbanites, for a lifestyle that requires spewing out most of the carbon that now covers the planet in an extra-thick blanket of insulation. And all to buy McMansions and gas-guzzling SUVs and trips to Disney World to get your screaming greedy kids plastic Baby Yoda toys that get dumped in the ocean.\nAnd it isn\u2019t only the climate you\u2019ve helped ruin. Thanks so very much too for visiting California\u2019s rural places, leaving your trash and roadkill in the wake of your giant RVs while refusing to fund forest management programs that could chip dead wood and use it to heat rural homes so people don\u2019t have to use propane or inefficient wood stoves.\nBut it isn\u2019t really mass consumption that enrages me so much as the virtue-signaling green-washed suburbanites who have spent the past twenty years pretending that the biggest climate change issue is climate denial. People who seem to think that once everyone believes in climate change, magically it will be fixed.\nThey\u2019ve managed to score an astonishing own goal on all of humanity, distracting everyone from the deeper challenge of untangling the wicked knot of perverted economic, social, and political incentives that are driving carbon pollution that isn\u2019t truly necessary anymore.\nWe already have all the technology we need for a global green infrastructure revolution \u2014 what the world lacks are the governing systems in place to put it to use.\nThe existence of climate denial has become a convenient excuse for inaction \u2014 or worse, action designed merely to educate.\nEven I was in college, back in the early 2000s, the facts of climate change were already widely accepted by almost everyone whose opinion mattered. Even in 2005 we were already being told there was only 5 or 10 years left to save the planet and calls for radically reforming the way we live were being amplified by celebrities.\nYet for all the talk, the exhortations and the eternal drive to teach everyone about managing their own carbon footprint, little of any meaning has been achieved. The latest IPCC report confirms that in all likely scenarios the average temperature on Earth will be 2 degrees Celsius warmer than it was in the 1800s by the time I\u2019m my parents\u2019 age.\nFrom the Sixth Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\nThe IPCC has modeled five scenarios for the future based on the level and speed of carbon emissions cuts over the next eighty years. And the outlook is bleak.\nWhen looking at alternate scenarios like this, it is important to remember that the worst and best cases are best seen as the boundaries of what is possible, not truly likely outcomes.\nCarbon reductions models are badly hampered by the fact that human factors are extremely difficult to pin down. People are never as good or as bad as you assume \u2014 they\u2019re almost always a mixed bag.\nThe middle three scenarios are far more likely, and boil down to three basic possibilities:\nThe world can\u2019t get organized, dooming the planet and ourselves to rapid, climage change that will disrupt life everywhere and kill millions, leading to today\u2019s extremes being seen as a memory of the good old days\nThe world eventually gets organized, winding up around mid-century with a planet where today\u2019s extremes are normal and set to get even worse before things settle down, but numbers are finally moving the right way\nThe world swiftly organizes, dramatically cutting carbon emissions from all sources, leading to a world where today\u2019s extremes are normal, but won\u2019t get any worse \u2014 and eventually will recede\nTrouble is, the governments that now exist around the world are incapable of organizing their way to paying a joint restaurant bill, much less handle a global challenge like climate change or even a more pressing threat like a global pandemic.\nBefore we can begin to hope for meaningful change, they are all going to have to collapse or be brought to heel by a global movement. A revolution that almost certainly won\u2019t take place until option 2 becomes the best we can possibly hope for \u2014 and might, as revolutions often do, provoke a brutal backlash and counter-revolution.\nBy then all the lands I grew up walking \u2014 in truth, lands walked for thousands of years by the indigenous peoples of the southern Cascades \u2014 will be barren and charred. And the place I live now will look more and more the lands of my childhood \u2014 and perhaps facing the same future not long after I am gone.\nThe situation is so grim because a huge degree of climate change is now already locked in. Carbon dioxide, once emitted, sticks around in the atmosphere for 50\u2013100 years.\nThe awful truth about climate change is that no one in power anywhere is being honest about what dealing with it really entails or why lauded international agreements like the Paris Accord are effectively articles of surrender guaranteed to doom millions of people to misery and \u2014 mostly the world\u2019s poor and vulnerable.\nBecause rich people and countries will engineer their way through, you can count on that. Most will happily shoot all the world\u2019s poor into space before making the hard journey themselves.\nHere are the *real* big myths about climate change that need to be confronted:\nThe majority of people can be convinced to change their personal lifestyles\nFossil fuel companies are the main impediment to fighting climate change\nCarbon trading and carbon taxes will substantially curb carbon emissions\nWorld governments can enforce large-scale reductions in carbon emissions\nClimate change will stop if carbon emissions cease\nHumans are doomed to extinction if climate change can\u2019t be stopped\nI\u2019ll dispel them all briefly in reverse order.\nSix is wrong because humans are incredible at survival. Not necessarily human societies, but human groups certainly are. No matter how bad climate change gets, some rich people will figure out how to build climate-controlled domes powered by green energy and charge for admission.\nIn the worst-case climate change scenario scientifically imaginable, Earth in 1,000 years will look like it did when the dinosaurs were alive. Within 100 years most fossil fuel sources will be used up, so there is an upper bound to human-caused climate change effects. The real issue is how fast the planet will transition to a state last observed tens of millions of years ago \u2014 and how much of the biosphere can survive a shift of that speed.\nFive is mistaken because of the cruel fact of residence time of carbon in the atmosphere. In the absolute best case scenario considered by the IPCC humans never stop emitting carbon before the middle of this century. That will still lock in many more decades of warming \u2014 just, proceeding slower than before. Good, but not good enough to save millions of lives.\nOn the flip side, natural sources of carbon emissions are getting larger as the planet warms. Methane is coming out of the Arctic permafrost as it melts \u2014 and this will accelerate. The truth is humans have to devise a way to pull carbon from the atmosphere, and this will require massive amounts of energy that can only come from green resources \u2014 and nuclear fuels, while they last.\nFour breaks for the same reason world governments as a collective can\u2019t even figure out how to produce and deliver Covid-19 vaccines to everyone on the planet despite that being the only way to prevent an even worse variant from emerging. Millions of people have died in a year and a half when everyone has the same incentive to act \u2014 and carbon pollution will always be profitable because it is tied to the most critical human system, after agriculture: energy.\nCountries like Russia with economies that rely on carbon will resist emissions cuts or pricing to their dying breaths. And there are no real ways to punish them, because sanctions regimes are never universal \u2014 they just create black markets someone the target regime will find a way to exploit. Subsidizing polluters to keep oil and gas in the ground is expensive and creates a perverse incentive on their part to drag out compliance in order to keep the subsidies going.\nThree doesn\u2019t work because basic essentials like food and fuel take up a massive chunk of the budgets of poorer people, who make up more than half of everyone on the planet, and fossil fuels are what keeps prices for these low. Start restricting carbon emissions without a substitute energy source and these prices will go up, leading to massive public resistance. It\u2019s been happening in France and the US.\nGlobal Wealth Pyramid\nYou pretty much have to solve poverty before you can begin using market-based solutions to reduce carbon pollution \u2014even then there is always the problem of policy leakage. As soon as carbon emissions are limited in one place they'll shift to others with weaker rules or black markets will form, with some countries doing enforcement better than others.\nTwo is appealing, but all the more deadly for that, because people aren\u2019t usually told the facts about how corporations really work. They are legally chartered by governments to act in the interest of their shareholders. They\u2019re fictional creations used to limit the liability of the people running them \u2014 basically, making it so you can\u2019t be personally sued for what your company does.\nExxon for example is not really a fossil fuel company \u2014 it is just a company that invests in fossil fuels. If it dis-invests from them, the potential for profit will lead to another company buying up their shares and no material change. Energy has intrinsic value \u2014 there must be a substitute before you can expect people to shift. Coal didn\u2019t replace wood until the infrastructure to get it to markets was built.\nOne ignores the total failure of any social movement across history to successfully convince everyone to choose virtuous behavior \u2014as well as the stark inequalities of our present world. It should be obvious to any thinking person that their own personal carbon-conserving efforts are utterly demolished by a single billionaire taking a trip to space. And educating or convincing everyone to the same moral position\u2026 that\u2019s what almost every religious faith has struggled to do, rarely with lasting success.\nAlso, it too easy to forget that most people in the world simply don\u2019t have the option to consider their carbon footprint. Poverty or fear of it drives behavior far more than green ethics ever will, as sad as that is. And you can\u2019t expect people to use tools they don\u2019t have \u2014 in many parts of the world, people still light their homes using pitch harvested from trees.\nTogether, these six myths of climate change are as responsible for stalling progress on climate change as outright denial. Half the deniers are just repeating political rhetoric \u2014 they don\u2019t even understand what climate change is or that they\u2019re actually against it too.\nNow I want to make it clear that I\u2019m not a climate doomer. I\u2019m not arguing that there is no hope so we should simply give up the fight.\nIn fact, the truth is exactly the opposite.\nThe next twenty years will determine the kind of world most of those reading this will get to inhabit in our later adulthood and elderly years. There is now no alternative to radical and immediate climate action on a global scale.\nIt will happen, sooner or later \u2014 it has to. Critical resource shortages loom on multiple fronts world leaders aren\u2019t acknowledging.\nBut you\u2019re not going to get to a better world through endless green moralizing or taxing carbon or banning fossil fuel companies.\nYou\u2019re only going to get there through actually building stuff that lets people make better choices.\nNot just people with disposable income, but everyone, everywhere.\nThe kinds of changes that are coming \u2014 most people can\u2019t even begin to imagine. I have a hard time keeping track of it all and I know what key signs and portents to watch from deep study over many years.\nClimate change\u2019s deeper impacts are going to roil the world in ways the human mind can scarcely comprehend. Extreme weather events are only the tip of the iceberg \u2014 other, far more basic systems enabling life as we know it will be disrupted.\nClimate inaction\u2014just like pandemic inaction\u2014 is a problem with consequences that increase exponentially with time. Which is why it is so tragic that the last twenty years have been largely wasted.\nThey were critical, but too many activists spent them boosting public awareness thinking that in and of itself will governments or individuals to meaningful action on the necessary scale.\nWhat the world must have to fight climate change is a global democratic government capable of going places and building things that local people can own and use to make their lives better.\nMost are not really even true democracies. Aside from a few notable cases like Switzerland, most western liberal democracies are republics where people vote for representatives who make laws as opposed to passing rules by a public vote.\nThe ultimate reason progress on climate change is so terribly stalled and will remain so for too long comes down to the fact most governments around the world \u2014 including the ones that call themselves liberal democracies \u2014 are not by and for the people, but the wealthy and well-connected, who have bought most representatives.\nDemocracies, autocracies \u2014 look anywhere and that same basic dynamic is at play. A few fight to rule the rest, dragging us into their fights.\nThe world is broken into over 200 countries, for all intents and purposes independent domains because their leaders all agree they prefer it this way. Many compete with rivals over alliances, territory, and access to resources, together spending around $2 Trillion annually on \u201cdefense\u201d matters.\nYet when it comes to defending their people against the changing climate, few are moving with anything like the haste the problem deserves.\nIt is in every living person\u2019s interest to get climate change under control because it is going to have a pronounced impact on how much food the planet can produce. Scarcity of food for any reason is one of the biggest drivers of social collapse and even the fear of it can trigger violence.\nClimate change will dramatically impact the global food supply because farmers rely on predictability to know what they can grow to harvest. The planet actually grows enough calories every year to feed 10\u201312 billion people, but upwards of half are lost or wasted because the global distribution system is inefficient \u2014 there again politics and governments are mostly to blame.\nWhat climate-induced weather events are going to do is cause the sudden losses of huge harvests that dramatically boost this waste. That will trigger upheavals in poorer regions that will ripple back to impact the richer. The global population is set to top out at around 9\u201310 billion at mid-century, so everyone can be fed.\nBut not if we lose too much of every annual harvest to unpredictable weather.\nClimate change will drag on the global economy to a degree few people realize. Insurance claims are going to go up across the board because of unexpected issues that arise, and the global economy can\u2019t function without insurance. Virtually every major business buys insurance against unexpected business losses or supply chain disruptions.\nThe more chaos in the world, the more claims are filed. Premiums go up, impacting business costs, which to maintain profit margins are passed onto consumers. The poor who are often forced to buy insurance despite their limited budgets are yet again harmed the most by the rise in prices.\nThe dirty secret about government is that most people in positions of responsibility know how dangerous climate change will be, but they are bound by broken accountability structures that force them to respond against the broader public interest.\nInstead, they\u2019re responding to lobbyists who work for businesses that view contact with politicians as a kind of profit-protection insurance of its own. A way to avoid getting regulated and secure bailouts in tough times.\nFighting climate change requires an all-of-society effort, but this is never going to be possible on a global level if we\u2019re stuck dealing with governments who have been bought by companies whose primary interest is avoiding costs.\nBecause the fight will cost a lot \u2014 but the price is ridiculously affordable if you take a long view and value human life, well at all.\nTo beat climate change you simply have to have an international organization with enough teeth to make climate pacts stick.\nIt also has to be democratically accountable. A true government for all of Earth. Not a United Nations clone \u2014something with real teeth, empowered to physically defend the world from climate change.\nYet it also can\u2019t be some all-powerful \u201cleviathan\u201d with the ability to directly control people\u2019s lives. A beast like that will almost immediately fall under the control of the rich and become tool of oppression.\nTo fight climate change, we have to have a decentralized democratic federation capable of persuading geographically defined populations \u2014 cities, districts, even whole countries \u2014 to join up one by one.\nThe Earth Democratic Federation, as I\u2019d call it, must be a free association of communities who elect to join a common global society dedicated to protecting planet and people on behalf of all.\nA key lesson of political ecology is that in most cases don\u2019t exploit the planet because they want to, but because they are forced to by bad systems.\nTo fight climate change, you have to find a way to guarantee a basic standard of living to everyone \u2014 full stop.\nOnly if every person, everywhere has healthy food, clean water and air, secure shelter, and the opportunity to express themselves and associate with others can you expect them to be willing to do their part in safeguarding the planet.\nA legitimate government must serve the people who elect it.\nService is about exchange \u2014 it isn\u2019t a two way street. People serve a country or ideal when they trust it will serve them in return. That is how the bond of trust operates \u2014 and why people get so angry when they don\u2019t feel adequately served by their government.\nThey\u2019re set to get a lot angrier, everywhere. Around the world people have been abandoned to pandemic, pollution, poverty, and violence by governments that still somehow always manage to find a way to tax them to build weapons of war and amass huge private fortunes.\nHalf of all American federal income taxes are spent on \u201cdefense\u201d against imagined enemies on the other side of the world \u2014and the United States military can\u2019t even beat the Taliban after 20 years of fighting.\nThe same futile waste happens in many other countries, too. Russia, China \u2014 no one truly poses a threat to anyone else on a national scale anymore, the era of mass military invasions is over. Grey-area conflict is all the rage, because any real war would soon go nuclear, and no government wants that.\nThe Earth Democratic Federation must find a way to pool the resources of the willing and convince entire geographic areas to agree to an international government empowered to accomplish one basic task:\nDefend the world against climate change.\nAnd when I say defense, I mean it in a comprehensive sense. People\u2019s lives and livelihoods must both be defended, and if a civil war breaks out because of underlying climate issues, the Earth Defense Forces must go in.\nAll regions that join will agree to commit 1% of their gross domestic product annually \u2014 about half of global military expenditures.\nThis will support an international defense force that can respond to climate disasters by:\nSecuring an affected area\nProtecting the local population\nFund the construction of locally-owned sustainable and resilient green infrastructure\nDevelop a decentralized democratic government rooted in providing basic services and maintaining the peace\nHandoff responsibilities to a government that will be invited to join the global federal system.\nCity by city, district by district, the Earth Democratic Federation will build a better future, with or without the help of self-interested traditional governments.\nBecause all true climate change solutions have to be rooted in what economists call supply-side solutions.\nHalf of the world lives in or in fear of poverty.\nCaught in this situation, they will do whatever they have to \u2014 including burning fossil fuels and cutting down forests \u2014 to have a stable and prosperous life like the other half does.\nThat\u2019s what Americans and Europeans did to get rich, after all \u2014 so why shouldn\u2019t they?\nYou just can\u2019t solve climate change without building green infrastructure everywhere, making it so ubiquitous that people can\u2019t imagine having any other kind.\nIt\u2019s already happening under the watch of a few governments \u2014 just much too slowly. Solar panels used to be much, much more expensive. Until Germany embarked on an energy transition where they bought millions and guaranteed a long-term market.\nChinese companies responded by ramping up production capabilities and innovating \u2014 and suddenly prices began to fall. That is how you build a green energy market.\nNo international organization presently exists with the heft to act like a country. If we want to make it through the next thirty years with hope of avoiding the kind rapid climate change that will kill tens of millions and displace hundreds of millions more, it\u2019s gotta get built \u2014 and fast.\nI doubt it could possibly happen fast enough to save my family home.\nBut the governments we have now definitely aren\u2019t going to cut it. Sooner or later, they\u2019re gonna get us all killed.\nSooner or later, humanity will have to build a better alternative.\nMeanwhile, I watch the fire maps, and wait for the bad news.", "comment_count": 10, "like_count": 237, "created_time": 1628266253682, "comment": [{"user_id": "869f66f3cda", "comment_time": 1628266253682, "comment": "Thank you for sharing!"}, {"user_id": "cf79dc5b4c3e", "comment_time": 1628960445182, "comment": "And also, most of China's emissions are due to making a bunch of crap that Americans and Europeans buy..."}, {"user_id": "cf79dc5b4c3e", "comment_time": 1628960375026, "comment": "Basically, all of those trees will die, burn, and be replaced by vegetation suited to the new environment.

Aliens could show up to save or destroy the world. There could even be a wave of global revolutions that finally achieves true communism in our time.\nAnything can happen. But most things won\u2019t.\nThe harsh future Americans face is one where the America rips itself to pieces after a Presidential election neither side is willing to accept the other could have won fair and square.\nWatching the Supreme Court fall to partisan interests to the degree it clearly has, given the imminent death of Roe v. Wade, offers more proof of America\u2019s grim future.\nUnderstanding why the American system is self destructing requires setting aside partisan ideology and looking at the guts of how the machine actually functions. Not as we would like it to, but as it truly is, and how powerful social and economic forces made it this way.\nFew Americans can even approach the necessary level objectivity anymore, which is a huge part of the problem. I only can because I\u2019ve been part of both political tribes during my four decades of life and have studied power dynamics intensively from a systems perspective.\nI grew up extremely rural, religious, and patriotic. I later earned my undergraduate degree in political science from UC Berkeley \u2014 yeah, that Berkeley. Days after I graduated from Cal I reported to Fort Knox to begin what turned out to be a single year on active duty as a cavalry scout in the United States Army. And enlisted side, not officer, though I wound up walking the first steps along that path up until a knee injury crushed that ambition.\nLike Treebeard from Lord of the Rings, I have no fixed side \u2014 I care only for the forests, so to speak. If that means I organize an army to tear down an evil wizard\u2019s city then screen the Riders of Rohan from Mordor Orcs while they charge to Gondor\u2019s aid, so be it. And it it means walling off the woods I care for while a futile war passes them by \u2014 I\u2019ll do that too.\nA truth partisans on neither side in America will admit is that Democrat and Republican are now mirror images. Not morally equivalent, but morality doesn\u2019t matter when each team\u2019s members insist only their worldview can be moral.\nThe Founders never meant for this to happen when they wrote the Constitution. For all their manifold failings, they did their best to create a working political system. But they lacked the scientific understanding required to realize that political institutions are, in a very real way, a kind of eternal game.\nOne meant to take advantage of people\u2019s natural tendency to act in their own self interest, driven by their particular worldview, to produce a reasonably fair game people don\u2019t reject when they lose and \u2014 this is most important of all \u2014 where no one wins all the time.\nPolitics is basically society\u2019s sewage system \u2014 inescapable because everyone is entitled to their own execrable political beliefs, yet the thing must be properly designed and maintained to avoid everyone smelling terrible and spreading disease.\nDemocracy\u2019s power is that it induces people to participate in the making of laws that impact their life, making them more likely to tolerate them. It can be done directly, through representatives or a hybrid of both, but the iron law is that it must be seen to work. When people lose faith in the game they pursue their own agendas so intensively that the whole thing flies apart.\nThe two party doom loop that is driving America\u2019s accelerating divorce is a function of the fact that America\u2019s governing institutions are desperately, horribly outdated. The Constitution has not been Amended for fifty years after being regularly tweaked across two centuries to keep it in line with changing times.\nThe two major parties have completely gamed out the American political system, in effect seizing control of all levels of government in most states. They have both aggressively gerrymandered House districts to limit competition. The Senate remains a policy choke point either party can use to prevent any change they fear will harm their interests.\nSmall wonder that Americans disapprove of most federal institutions by wide margins year after year and perpetually express a desire for more political options that never emerge \u2014the system is essentially rigged so that they can\u2019t. And powerful media interests fight to prevent any change, because the two-party disaster is so brutally easy to profit from.\nBoth parties have become nothing more than profit-seeking political brands whose members wrap themselves up in sanctimonious rhetoric designed to reduce all political debates to a kind of team sport. Every single elected federal politician in America is fundamentally a fundraiser, a servant of donors instead of the people.\nUnder the hood of the nonsense partisans spew is a simple goal: get you to give them money.\nThe two false choices in America, Republican/Democrat, Conservative/Liberal, Right/Left, are eternally reified by a media establishment which knows us-against-them morality tales are much more eyeball grabbing than honest, impartial analysis.\nThe way American politics is covered is specifically intended to produce subscribers or content advertisers will pay for ads to appear next to. That\u2019s it, that\u2019s all \u2014 no other factors matter more in a world of for-profit news media than the size of the audience and how efficiently it can be induced to engage.\nThis business model relies on creating sticky positive feedback loops where people feel like their involvement and engagement matters. People naturally prefer to read news that is slanted to confirm their preexisting beliefs, and absent a countervailing force all profit-seeking media is doomed to fragment along ideological lines to more efficiently reach target audiences.\nIn a multi-party system the damage this causes is mitigated by complexity. In a two-party system where each side bases its actions on how it thinks its sole opponent will move you have a recipe for disaster.\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s mad decision in Citizens United formalized this system, allowing a massive injection of cash to turn American politics into an enormous growth market. Instead of political participation mattering mostly at the ballot box, now it feeds a perpetual bloodletting that always escalates because that\u2019s how American media narratives work: increasing tension culminates in a grand epic showdown where good confronts and defeats evil.\nThis is not democracy, folks, no matter how many times someone with a fancy Ivy League PhD insists otherwise. When rich people\u2019s votes are effectively weighted by their ability to offer massive support to political candidates or parties you have a qualitatively different system than democracy.\nAmerica\u2019s craven political masters don\u2019t want the world to understand that the American federal government has degenerated into a simple protection racket individuals and businesses are forced to engage with. The alternative is having laws and regulations put in place that directly harm your interests, a game the wealthy and well-connected will always be far more capable of playing than the general public.\nThe bulk of all American federal income tax revenues are pumped into the military-industrial complex. The remainder of the discretionary federal budget is a pork trough feeding subsidies to well-connected big businesses and the few swing districts left.\nBoth parties play the game the exact same way, with Americans bullied into participating through choosing between two stale brands that rarely deliver what they promise to voters even when they hold all branches of the federal government \u2014 looking at you, Pelosi, Schumer, and Biden.\nFrankly, why would they?\nWhy would the Democrats ever forgive all student loans, institute national healthcare, and reduce wealth inequality? Why would the Republicans ever build a complete border wall, drain the lobbyist swamp, or mandate fairness in media?\nThey have no compelling reason to!\nCulture wars way more profitable than normal democratic politics, creating a lifelong customer base the other side can\u2019t hope to cleave away because of negative partisanship.\nIn America, the endless fight between these two brands remains self-sustaining and profitable so long as there are things people need from the government that it can\u2019t deliver because of constant gridlock. The more angry and afraid voters get, the more they feel forced to donate to the very people who benefit professionally.\nThe hell of American politics is that participation has become a giant Chinese finger trap. The more you fight the worse it gets. The partisan media sells Americans a sick myth that this is just the way things have to be until someone finally wins this uncivil war. But here\u2019s the thing: No one is ever going to win.\nUnder the Constitution the USA is a federation of semi-sovereign states with substantial powers. And almost all of America\u2019s fifty states now offer enduring support to one party or the other because of the close link between regional culture, political beliefs, and economic interests going back to the colonial days.\nIf the federal government dissolved tomorrow, Blue States on the West Coast and in the Atlantic Northeast would immediately adopt every progressive policy you can imagine. National healthcare, free education, climate action, taxing the rich \u2014 we\u2019d have it all. Blue States are rich enough that our tax dollars subsidize the Red State voters who use the federal government to prevent us from having things we want.\nMeanwhile Red States like Florida and Texas are set to ban abortions, curtail LGBTQ+ rights, limit what teachers can say about racism, and end a slew of social welfare programs. In their America immigration desperately needed to mitigate labor shortages will be limited, taxes slashed, guns carried visibly on the street, and public displays of Christianity mandated.\nWhen people living in a country-sized geographic region start to feel they have more in common with their neighbors than they do folks living in distant areas, national unity is dead and done. Trying to force it will ultimately trigger a fission blast as surely as smashing together two sub-critical uranium cores in the heart of an atomic bomb.\nDespite the claims of pundits and politicians who need people to believe their nonsense to keep making money, America has never been unified. Unity implies everyone agreeing on basic truths, but this simply isn\u2019t possible in a country that has always been an agglomeration of wildly diverging interests, populated by diverse peoples coming from all over the world.\nIt is the inability of America\u2019s federal government to perform under the strain of partisanship married to profit interests that has destroyed its credibility in the eyes most Americans. 40% already say they would consider secession if given the option, and in partisan-dominated states that number reaches a majority among the dominant political tribe. Approval ratings for Congress are in the 30% range at best\u2014 if this is democracy, small wonder so many people don\u2019t care about it anymore!\nThis basic disunity cannot be papered over because most Americans now know, even if it is impolitic to speak the truth aloud, that we\u2019d all be better off and happier without half of America\u2019s states holding us back from whatever it is we\u2019ve decided we want from our government.\nGeography underwrites this simple truth: The Big Sort has been underway for a long time. Most Americans already live in places where people\u2019s values match up with their own. Those who don\u2019t are geographically clustered within Red or Blue states in ways that are now giving rise to state-level secession movements because the system disenfranchises everyone in the end.\nGoverning America today is like trying to run modern software on a Windows 95 PC. It simply wasn\u2019t built for this level of complexity. Sooner or later this system will crash because the two party stalemate has rendered any meaningful change impossible at a time when everyone is demanding it.\nNeither the Democrats nor the Republicans want to or at this point can change \u2014 each as a brand is bound by its own history and rhetoric. Then you have the fact that people who choose a side and invest their career in it can always be expected to double down on the game to protect their livelihood.\nIn 2020, just as I predicted they would, the Democrats tried to make the election all about Trump \u2014 and what happened? The highest turnout for a Republican in history, Democrats\u2019 margins among the Black and Latino voters slipping almost enough that the shift of old white voters angry at Trump\u2019s miserable response to Covid failed to carry the day.\nYet this is their plan going into 2022 and 2024: make everything about Trump. Giving him exactly what he wants, feeding his power.\nJust 44,000 votes in Arizona, Georgia, and Wisconsin are all that prevented Trump from winning a second term. That\u2019s all, in what should by all rights have been a landslide election. Since Obama\u2019s election in 2008 swing state margins have only gotten narrower, most of the Rust Belt slowly slipping into the Red column as younger, more progressive people flee for places with jobs.\nThe trend lines for the Democrats are absolutely abysmal, but the leadership adamantly refuses to accept that it has utterly failed because the donor dollars keep rolling in and so everyone is able to keep their jobs. Fake it until you make it remains the white American suburbanite\u2019s guiding star, and nowhere is this more true than in politics where as long as you denounce someone on the other side loudly enough people will act like you\u2019re accomplishing something.\nIt won\u2019t take much more pressure to shatter America now. As key experts on both sides of the political spectrum are warning, 2020 was a dry run for what Trump or a future Republican will attempt in the event of a close election in key swing states, driven by the demands of their voters.\nIt remains a minor miracle that even solid Republicans pushed back on Trump\u2019s gambit. But over a year after the January 6th insurrection polls still consistently show that a strong majority of Republicans believe in Trump\u2019s stolen election myth. Those Republicans who opposed his scheme are being run out of politics. All the vital signs are being sent to state-level officials that party expects things to go very differently the next time the opportunity arises.\nImagine if officials had gone along with Trump\u2019s scam: early 2021 would have been a lot worse than the Capitol Riot\u2014 Blue states would have faced mass uprisings. This was an outcome clearly anticipated by a high-level wargame done by members of both parties before the election \u2014 a simulation that was terminated when the West Coast team seceded.\nIt is well within the realm of possibility \u2014 frankly, it is more likely than not now \u2014 that Trump will return to the White House in 2025 by hook or crook. Trump is viewed as favorably as Ronald Reagan among Republicans and remains far more popular than any other politician on the right\u2014 at the moment he\u2019s as popular as any other American politician.\nPolls today are nowhere near a perfect reflection of what they\u2019ll look like in 2024. But none of the trends that have dominated American politics over the past ten years are abating and there is no precedent for an ex-President popular in his party running for election in the modern era. The mainstream media narratives about Trump have been consistently wrong, and I see no scenario where Trump takes less than a plurality of the Republican primary vote in 2024.\nMight he be put on trial between now and then? Maybe, but I doubt it. First because he has a swarm of sycophants who take all the legal risks for their shady boss. Second, because it would probably trigger an explosion of protests and rebound to his advantage.\nIt is difficult to see how the Democrats can recover from Biden\u2019s disastrous first two years. Having over-promised and under-delivered on the pandemic, economy, and foreign policy, there isn\u2019t a shred of Biden\u2019s alleged competence left to run on. He was supposed to make everything normal again, but for most people it feels worse than the Trump years no matter how much Biden travels around telling people they ought to be grateful for him not being the other guy.\nBiden approval compared to recent Presidents. Tied with Trump. From 538.\nDemocrats whose Twitter feeds aren\u2019t blowing up from whatever dumb thing Trump said today may choose to pretend all is well, but to most Americans the pressures of inflation compare poorly to the boom times of the pre-pandemic Trump years. They care about inflation and the stock market a lot more than Trump\u2019s irritating social media act.\nRepublicans are certain to take the House in the 2022 midterms which means 2023 will see a parade of partisan investigations into the Biden Administration. Trump can announce his candidacy early that year in order to claim credit for the midterm wins, leaving the Democrats likely trying to repeat the near-total disaster of 2020 by making the race all about Trump again.\nThis is bound to backfire. Democrats believe that any properly educated person will feel compelled to vote for the allegedly pro-science, pro-democracy party they forget that voter behavior is most strongly driven by identity. People vote with their in group \u2014 the fact most Democrats are college educated has blinded them to the reality that they do exactly the same thing.\nRight or wrong millions of people who didn\u2019t often vote before 2016 feel like Trump speaks for them \u2014 or at the least he fights for things they care about. Like it or not, in an alienated, fearful society like America\u2019s this is all you need to generate the kind of passion that leads to fools attacking the Capitol.\nYet give them this much credit: you don\u2019t see progressives fighting that hard for their beliefs, now do you? Kids were and probably still are separated from parents and locked in cages on the border, but nobody charges in to liberate them from ICE. Where are Occupy, Antifa, Extinction Rebellion and all the rest of the right-wing bugaboos when Biden is demanding the police get more funding while public lands are fracked for dirty oil?\n2024 is set to be brutally close and both sides are fully primed to allege the other is playing dirty. It is more likely than not that all the swing states that matter will be run by Republicans from top to bottom after 2022. Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona, Georgia, and Pennsylvania will all be vulnerable to state legislature shenanigans and likely Republican governors to boot, making this Trump\u2019s easiest map for 2024:\nTrump\u2019s Basic 2024 map. Made using 270towin.org\nWhen (most of) the votes are counted (and re-counted) in 2024, multiple Republican-run state legislatures are set to get involved, meaning the Supreme Court gets pulled in too \u2014 with a 6\u20133 conservative majority. Even Roberts\u2019 moderating influence isn\u2019t enough to beat that, at least if Roe v. Wade\u2019s imminent destruction is anything to go by, so the novel conservative argument that state legislatures have total power in Presidential elections is likely to be upheld.\nThat means the period between the election and inauguration will degenerate into escalating protests. Even a few incidents of violence will feed fears of more to come, creating the stage for self-fulfilling prophecies. State governors will be forced to activate National Guard units, generating even more tension and fear and conspiratorial thinking.\nAs inauguration day approaches, Trump will be on social media promising to crack down on protestors as soon as he\u2019s back in the Oval Office. After his administration\u2019s frankly criminal and now mostly forgotten attack on Portland during Black Lives Matter, governors in deep-blue regions like the West Coast and Northeast will face a terrible choice: accept what the majority of their voters sincerely believe is a stolen election or reject the result with all the dangers that choice entails.\nIf the Democrats do manage to win, the shoe will simply be on the other foot. Florida and Texas are set to lead the way in openly defying the federal government and advance the old cause of state\u2019s rights. And there\u2019s not much the Blue federal government will be able to do about it.\nStates will likely not secede in this scenario. Instead, they will claim to be safeguarding the Constitution against perversions by hostile partisans. Unlike 1860, no one will repudiate the United States of America and form a new country \u2014 each region will instead insist they\u2019re the true America.\nYou might think this sets the stage for a second civil war, but the evidence from Ukraine shows that an inter-American conflict is simply not possible to sustain for long. If and when the Red-Blue divide turns into a total breach, both sides will have ample excuse to leave the other alone \u2014 neither can win a total war.\nIn the wake of a split at the Presidential level a steady unraveling of the federal government will commence. Backed by the majority of the voters in their states governors will start to act like independent nations \u2014 as many are already starting to. They\u2019ll be forced to band together, smaller states attaching to larger and wealthier ones, the divisions between Red and Blue states creating regional blocs:\nAmerica Splits into Eight Autonomous Constitutional Regions, states remain intact. Base image made using Mapchart.net\nPeople too often forget that laws are only relevant when they can be enforced. So when Red and Blue state governors one day split into camps over the identity of the legitimate President, America will be functionally divided into Red and Blue Constitutional Zones. A failure of geographically distinct areas to agree on the function of major institutions is the most fundamental mortal danger in any federal system because more local jurisdictions can always set up parallel institutions then dare someone to come take them away.\nThing is, Republicans have become the dominant cultural force in rural areas because educated people in urban and suburban areas largely look down on rural folks, so state-level separatist movements could emerge that threaten to fragment a number of states along the urban-rural divide. This could easily produce a map of balkanized post-America that looks like the one at the top of this essay.\nNow, there will always be conservative and liberal Americans living in the same jurisdiction. But once the federal government is shattered, we\u2019ll at least be free to reform our democratic systems so they work better wherever we live. Once Red and Blue don\u2019t fear domination at the federal level the benefits of negative partisanship will decline and political coalitions will shift within each region.\nPeople can always find ways to work out their problems without violence or extreme partisanship. America\u2019s political game is just that \u2014 a game, rigged by a group of players with too much power who pit the rest of us against each other, making it impossible to live together in peace.\nIf you\u2019re reading this and wondering how you should respond to this grim assessment, here\u2019s what I can say with confidence right now:\nIf you don\u2019t want to have to deal with it, move to a state or at least an area within a state where most people vote the way you do.\nIf your aim is to stop it from happening, get on board with a radical solution like Biden retiring before the midterms or building a working Third Party.\nIf you\u2019d just like to protect people from the impacts, focus on promoting social justice and sustainable development at the local level, doing what you can to present your work as apolitical to the degree it can be.\nBut by the gods, whatever you choose to do with your time on this Earth, don\u2019t fall prey to the delusion that uncritical participation in American partisan politics achieves anything. In a real democracy engagement is vital, but in this oligarchic anocracy it becomes a deadly trap.\nEngagement equals profit. And supply will always rise to meet demand sooner or later. Until the system changes, participation is just feeding the beast.", "comment_count": 5, "like_count": 250, "created_time": 1651504891289, "comment": [{"user_id": "869f66f3cda", "comment_time": 1651504891289, "comment": "Thank you for sharing!"}, {"user_id": "8d8a3679214", "comment_time": 1651732687534, "comment": "Thanks for writing this.

Base image from liveuamap.\nBecause so much of what is published in the English-speaking media is a product of America\u2019s silly information war over Ukraine, it can be extremely hard to understand how the Russo-Ukraine war is unfolding. Too many well-meaning supporters of Ukraine seem to believe that spreading memes on social media and mocking Russian military screwups actually accomplishes anything.\nBut the fight for Ukraine will be won or lost on the battlefield and nowhere else. War never changes, even if the tools used to fight it do. Cyberwar, Infowar \u2014 these are just different thought domains made up by academics trying to apply the stale schemas of Liberalism.\nReal warfare is about exploiting terrain to secure resources. What is a resource? Anything a fighting force can use to help accomplish its mission. What is terrain? Texture, in short. Anything that shapes how a physical force moves across a landscape.\nTactics are what combat units use to press their advantage and win with minimal losses. Operations involve the coordination of multiple independent combat units operating across a landscape. Strategy is the plan that drives their actions in a logical way and creates the conditions for victory to emerge through the efforts of people in the field.\nIt is important to remember that there are no hard and fast rules of war except these. The science of warfare is basically applied resource management under conditions of extreme competition. Any war could in fact be non-violent \u2014 that\u2019s what sports matches are, non-lethal war \u2014 but the powers sending people to fight refuse to follow the same rules of conflict, leading to bloodshed.\nQuestions of morality are irrelevant \u2014 each side in a fight will always believe its in the right. Victory settles the matter provided the other side accepts defeat, which isn\u2019t always the case. As long as you\u2019re still breathing you can still fight, and hope springs eternal \u2014 plus, as Ukraine proved by defeating Putin\u2019s lunge for Kyiv, sometimes your enemy makes dumb mistakes.\nIt has become clear since Putin\u2019s assault on Ukraine began in February that the initial Russian attack was driven by mistaken beliefs about Ukraine\u2019s willingness to fight. The only way the paltry force Russia sent to Kyiv, insufficient to take or hold a city of that size, could have won the fight is if Ukraine hadn\u2019t fought back. Initial Russian operations appear to have been planned by the FSB, Russia\u2019s intelligence agency and successor to the Soviet era KGB and GRU.\nSpies make poor military planners in most cases, failing to understand how a few well-equipped and motivated soldiers can throw a well-oiled machine into disarray. Russian forces invading from Belarus had to pass through difficult terrain that, once Ukraine\u2019s defenders recovered from the shock of the initial attack, let them channel Russian columns into artillery kill zones and send small units against supply lines that were restricted to a single major logistics artery running from Belarus to Kyiv.\nThis assault from the north was supported at a distance from a major push through Konotop, south of Chernihiv and north of Sumy. After racing several hundred kilometers down a pair of major highways this axis of attack ran out of gas, having to spend most of its combat capabilities protecting long supply lines Ukraine was able to constantly harass.\nAfter Week 1, Russian strategy began an inexorable shift away from the assault on Kyiv towards a grinding effort meant to seize substantial chunks of Ukraine\u2019s territory in the east and south. Forces in the north first tried to encircle Kyiv but failed because of poor planning, hostile terrain, and ferocious Ukrainian counterattacks made possible by the fact Ukraine pulled forces from the south to defend Kyiv early in the war.\nThis second phase of the fight was a failure in the north, leading to the sudden withdrawal of the 40,000 or so soldiers and ~60 of Russia\u2019s 120 committed battalion tactical groups late in March. This shift appears to mark the Russian military taking over strategic leadership of the war from the FSB. In Kherson province across the Dnieper, along the Azov coast, and across Luhansk Russian operations began to be more closely directed towards setting the stage for the offensive now beginning across Donbas.\nFor several weeks, while the forces committed in the north were refitted and redeployed, Russia has conducted a shaping campaign meant to keep Ukraine from flooding all its combat power to Donbas. Nationwide missile strikes have continued nonstop while Russia \u2014 late to the information war game but no less dedicated for that, hello Kremlin trolls! \u2014 has continued to act like its intends to to try and create a land corridor to Moldova in an attempt to keep Ukraine from concentrating forces around Kharkiv and Dnipro. The late Moskva was likely part of this, hence its positioning close to the Ukraine-Romania border before its demise.\nIf you take a step back from the \u201canalysis\u201d offered by mainstream American outlets like ISW what has been underway for several weeks has been obvious. Russia has reset its posture and apparently learned from its mistakes, massing 90 or so BTGs in and around Donbas to create a 2\u20131 raw force ratio in the region. This will allow Russian breakthrough forces to concentrate in 3:1 or better ratios at select points of attack.\nFor about a week now the standard Russian shaping operations their doctrine insists are necessary ahead of a fight have been pounding Ukraine\u2019s defenders. Logistics are apparently becoming critical along the line of contact where Ukraine\u2019s most elite formations, the ten or so brigades of the JFO, have been fighting Russian probing attacks and artillery bombardments for two months now and watching Russia achieve breakthroughs in the south to take Mariupol and the north to control Luhansk.\nThe basic Russian military objective in the upcoming operation is obvious and simple: cut off Ukrainian forces in Donbas from support. Without supplies and reinforcements even elite units can be isolated, fixed in place, and worn down like defenders of Mariupol have been until they are incapable of fighting.\nPutin likely needs a substantial victory by May 9th, when the annual victory day parade commemorating the defeat of Nazi Germany seems set to mark a new level of mobilization in Russian society. Where the first month or so of the war Russian media denied that a major war was even underway, now there has been a marked shift to portray the fight in Ukraine as an existential war against Nazis backed by NATO who seek Russia\u2019s destruction.\nThis holds grave implications for the future, presaging a more substantial mobilization and very possibly an indefinite continuation of the war in Ukraine \u2014 maybe elsewhere, too. This is now a full-on proxy war between Russia and NATO that will escalate eventually given the rhetoric both sides are using. America insists that Russia must be defeated and weakened, while Russia says that NATO support for a Nazi-dominated Ukraine threatens Moscow\u2019s security.\nThe seeds of a far greater and more terrible conflict are sprouting \u2014 it is now very possible that future generations will look back on 2022 as the beginning of a time of global war much like the First and Second World or the Napoleonic Wars. This nightmare may well consume all of this decade, until the climate and energy crises bite hard enough nobody has time for anything but building renewable energy.\nBut before we get to the future, the Battle for Donbas awaits.\nRussian operations in the southeast of Ukraine have been far more competently executed than the ones in the north. While everyone was focused on Kyiv, Russian forces in Ukraine\u2019s south and east have put themselves in the exact position I expected they would before moving to encircle Ukrainian forces in Donbas.\nBattles are always shaped by terrain because texture is what military units rely on to hide and survive on the modern battlefield. The detect-target-kill loop is absolutely vicious when a single networked remote camera or drone can direct accurate artillery fire or airstrikes anywhere in sight. Most tactics are rooted in launching overwhelming ambushes from a hide then moving to a new one before the other side can counterattack \u2014 this is true of scouts, infantry, tanks, artillery, air defense\u2026 frankly everybody in a fight.\nOperational art in military science is about organizing the movements of independent tactical units so they function like an organism. Each type of unit has weapons useful for a particular role, and when things go well each mutually supports other units in its area to create overlapping fields of fire. And strategy depends on linking operations together to overwhelm and defeat an enemy.\nBut all of this depends on terrain, with its texture \u2014 or rather, density of defensible site \u2014 shaping the course of the battle. Russian forces have had the most success in regions with little cover and get stalled along watercourses, urban areas, and wood lines for exactly this reason.\nOn a map, a major military operation often looks like a flood unleashed, following the contours of the terrain and moving most quickly in locations with the least texture, a function of where it is and isn\u2019t possible to efficiently defend. Every movement on a battlefield requires energy, which is fundamentally scarce.\nUnits lose organization and effectiveness the longer they\u2019re in the field, so economy of force \u2014 making the most of the assets you have \u2014 is key. The farther a military unit gets from its home base, the longer supplies have to go to get to them until new depots can be set up, meaning it becomes effectively weaker as it advances.\nBlood secures terrain, metaphorical or literal. And all warfare is ultimately about this \u2014 no air force or navy has ever ended a major war all on its own. Ground forces are always involved because to stop a dedicated enemy from hurting you physical occupation of their resources nodes is required.\nThis basic military science, rooted in systems thinking, has allowed me to fairly accurately forecast most of the key developments in Putin\u2019s assault on Ukraine going back to last year when his buildup began. Where my projections have not been accurate in a specific sense \u2014 like the bum rush to Kyiv \u2014 the reasons Russia failed were present in the theory of why that was a bad idea and serve to confirm it. Putin trying to pretend Kyiv was going to be Budapest or Prague was his error, and his assessment of Ukraine\u2019s swift collapse was widely shared in English-speaking intelligence circles too, showing just how much spies truly understand war.\nIn any case, Russia has a single basic objective in Donbas: surround and isolate Ukraine\u2019s main military forces. This will either allow future operations to slowly demolish the pocket or set the stage for forcing Ukraine into ceasefire negotiations.\nSuccess here is vital to Putin\u2019s survival \u2014 he cannot lose this fight. This means that if Ukraine successfully repels the assault, escalation to the nuclear level is likely with targets being key logistics nodes like railway junctions and bridges over the Dnieper. The same likely holds if Ukraine seeks to liberate lost territories east and south of the Dnieper.\nAnd the hard truth is that Russia has substantial military superiority over Ukraine along the flanks north and south of Donbas. The terrain is very flat and close to Russian supply and air bases. Russian aircraft can strike Ukrainian forces from multiple angles, most of their inbound and outbound flight covered by Russian air defenses while Ukraine\u2019s are by this point badly weakened, save at low altitudes where handheld surface to air missiles are almost as common as portable anti-tank weapons.\nUkraine\u2019s air force is still in action, likely operating from dispersed rough bases thanks to the capabilities of MiG-29 and Su-25 jets to handle this, something American and European aircraft generally can\u2019t do, except for the Swedish Gripen. But they appear to be relegated to limited actions at low altitude, mostly behind Ukrainian lines where pairs of fighters dash at inbound Russian aircraft to try and scare them off and break up their formations before retreating, sometimes unsuccessfully.\nRussia also has artillery superiority and will maintain it even after the new systems Ukraine is finally getting from NATO countries are put into operation. The trouble with new weapons is that it takes months to become proficient using them, and NATO needed to have been intensively training Ukrainian forces on high-tech kit since the war began for it to have any effect now.\nIn reality Ukraine\u2019s allies seem to be preparing for it to lose Donbas in hopes this terminates the active phase of the war. They simply want to make the victory as costly for Putin as possible to make it unlikely Russia can launch yet another offensive later this summer.\nMy evaluation is that most Russian forces north and south of Donbas have been operationally paused for several weeks while Russian commanders waited on reinforcements that began arriving in large numbers in the week before Orthodox Easter. They and those along the Line of Contact, where each side has so many fortifications neither is likely to break through in a frontal assault, have been unleashing relentless barrages and constantly probing Ukrainian lines but not pushing to break through. This keeps Ukraine\u2019s commanders guessing about the exact location of the hammer blows Russian forces are preparing to deliver.\nBasic Russian plan for a double envelopment of Donbas. Blue marks broadly approximate Ukrainian positions and Red Russian, full arrows show main likely thrust paths, dashed arrows possible alternates. Base map from liveuamap\nUkraine has been launching local counterattacks to disrupt the buildup as well as trying to push close to Kherson, with some success. But not enough to stop the double envelopment that is now unfolding \u2014 a mark of how much more support Ukraine\u2019s forces truly need to win outright.\nBut Russian deployments still threaten the possibility of renewed offensives in Kherson, deep into Ukraine\u2019s dangerously exposed logistics lines, and even towards Kyiv, though a repeat of the February assault is extremely unlikely. Yet the mere threat keeps Ukrainian forces spread out across the country and less able to reinforce the vulnerable Izyum and Huliaipole sectors where Russia is concentrating massive forces.\nThe plan? What I predicted a couple weeks ago: moving fast across the least difficult terrain the furthest from Ukrainian forces to the east or west Russian columns can get. The objective is to cut the main logistics links to the JFO along the Line of Contact and make counterattacks move over open ground where they can be more easily targeted.\nIn the coming days between 20\u201330 BTGs look set to punch southwest from Izyum. Another grouping of similar size will likely go North from between Huliaipole and Velyka Novosilka. A third grouping will remain spread out along a broad arc including the Line of Contact to maintain pressure on Ukrainian forces there and keep them from disengaging to intervene.\nThe northern and southern wings will probably push down roads to surround and isolate pockets of Ukrainian forces. After the tanks go by light infantry can fight off attempts to break out or raid logistics convoys and artillery can pound Ukrainian positions day and night. Unlike the assault on Kyiv each wing of the attack needs to cover only about 80\u2013100km in a straight line, which they ought to be able to achieve in a week or two if they have the strength.\nFrankly, I doubt Ukraine\u2019s forces can stop the attack head-on. History shows the front edge of the Russian advance is like a bulldozer \u2014 best move is to let it pass by then strike flanks and logistics train because Russian artillery can simply plaster an area, leveling villages.\nNormally I would be extremely hesitant to suggest this, but the morale and effectiveness of Ukraine\u2019s forces so far indicate sufficient cohesion that commanders might let Russia\u2019s advance succeed in order to harry it then turn the tables and surround it in a sudden counterattack.\nUkraine may be moving towards the kind of decentralized warfare networks and remote sensors make possible. Big, unwieldy military formations may be systematically vulnerable to smaller ones operating independently for long periods of time. In 2015 Ukraine had an armor group operating far behind separatist lines pull off a major raid, and the performance of Ukrainian forces the past two months tell me they probably have the discipline and skill to pull off similar feats.\nAfter witnessing the unforgivable atrocities Russian forces have committed in their invasion I doubt it is possible for Zelensky to do as I recommended two months ago and withdraw from Donbas to hold a more defensible line further west. I thought this necessary because, fearing this always would turn into a long war, I felt the loss of Ukraine\u2019s main fighting forces too great a danger.\nHowever, I understand that Ukraine feels it necessary to expend its forces to damage Russia as much as possible, trusting to NATO aid to allow it to re-equip and re-train ahead of future assaults. It may be that Ukraine will take the bold step of risking its main forces becoming encircled in order to let Russia over-extend itself. After that Ukrainian forces will execute a double envelopment of their own from the west and east.\nOutline of possible Ukraine Army counterattack to trap Russian BTGs in pocket while holding lines elsewhere. Red is Russia, Blue Ukrainian. Basemap from liveuamap.com\nThe danger is that this will force Ukrainian forces to move out of cover, making them ripe targets for air attack. Russian commanders likely hope to cut off Donbas then put their forces into a defensive posture, clearing a 30\u201340km corridor where their logistics columns can be secure at the center and artillery can punish any attempt to cut them off. If Ukraine tries a counterattack and it fails, its forces could be isolated and defeated one at a time.\nSo it is entirely possible that Ukraine will be forced to fight doggedly to hold every inch of ground \u2014 and succeed. It appears Ukrainian forces are better at operating at night, which could give them a crucial edge. In that case both sides might fight to a general stalemate over the next two weeks, the lines firming up however they stand then until Moscow and Kyiv can muster new forces and start the fighting again this summer.\nIn that case the war will simply continue and slowly escalate. And the longer it goes on the more extreme each sides\u2019 demands will naturally be to end it. If Russia succeeds in its immediate aim and wins in Donbas, it could build up to a summer offensive that isolates Kharkiv and even Dnipro, brutally partitioning Ukraine before settling down for a harsh winter of playing energy wars with Europe and starving these cities into submission.\nIf Ukraine holds off the Russian onslaught, it might even consider launching counterattacks to liberate stolen territory. These are unlikely to come, however, in Donbas \u2014 at least not at first. Partly because of the threat of Russian nuclear escalation, but mostly because there are more vital targets.\nThe Russian salient across the Dnieper around Kherson and its supply lines passing through Izyum east of Kharkiv are the most promising targets. If Ukraine could nip off these penetrations, further attempts to encircle Donbas will be close to impossible. Kherson ought to have priority though because the risk of a Russian push into the center of Ukraine or towards Moldova will remain \u2014 and the city is the largest to fall to Russia so far, its inhabitants terrorized.\nAs for the future, I\u2019m sorry to say that it looks bleak for all of us no matter who wins the Battle of Donbas.\nZooming out to the geostrategic level, the competition between Great Powers, and it is now clear that Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has accelerated the shift to a multipolar world system. The American-dominated Five Eyes Alliance is the fading remnant of the Anglo-Saxon Empire, dedicated to pretending inequality isn\u2019t ripping the thing apart. Macron\u2019s surprisingly large victory over Le Pen secures Europe\u2019s position as another major power, even if it will take some more time to escape America\u2019s shadow.\nThen you\u2019ve got China, which is to flailing Russia what the European Union is to failing America. Separate, but allied for the present, well aware that the world will look very different three or four years from now. India now counts as a major power too, and it insists on maintaining its traditional neutral position except when it comes to China, where it aligns with the US, as do most countries in East Asia.\nAfrica, the Middle East, South and Central America, Southeast Asia, Central Asia \u2014 people in the rest of the world are just trying to get by. Which is getting harder and harder as prices for fuel and food rise.\nAn era of global war that forces economic decoupling can only produce resource shortages and inflation. Which are the two most powerful social forces at the macro level that impact almost everyone, so tend to form positive and extremely destabilizing political, economic, and social feedback loops.\nThe last time there were worldwide price shocks in food and fuel countries all over the world disintegrated, in the Middle East and beyond \u2014 what\u2019s happening in Sri Lanka today is a mirror image of 2011, and the unrest globally has only just begun. The deterioration of the American and British political systems and rise of separatism can be directly linked to the financial crisis of the late 2000s and who lost out during the recovery. This same force is behind right-wing nationalist movements taking root everywhere, just as it was after the end of World War One.\nDespite all Putin has lost, he is still winning at the game he cares about most. The world is destabilized and chaos is something he can exploit better than most. America faces an epic Constitutional crisis in less than three years. If he can hold on until then and tear parts of Ukraine off in the process, the simple fact that Donald Trump is currently the most popular political figure in America will leave his biggest target paralyzed.\nPutin will regret it, given that just the West Coast and Eastern Europe working in concert could take him down while keeping China honest at the same time. All the powerful people around the globe will regret letting this disaster unfold because they have no way of controlling what has been unleashed \u2014 the future belongs to us, not them, because they\u2019ve stolen what\u2019s rightfully ours and the little people of the world want their planet back.\nHistory doesn\u2019t repeat, but it certainly rhymes, because it represents the unfolding of an enormous global system. Collapses are driven by the same social forces every time\u2014 ignorance, greed, inflexibility. Powerful agents\u2019 own inability to perceive what\u2019s happening escalates the situation, like two friends in a bitter quarrel each dedicated to winning the argument at hand and forgetting that some victories are costly \u2014 and permanent.\nThe paradox of doom and hope is that all that they are flip sides of the same coin. Destruction leads to creation \u2014 out of necessity, a lot of the time, because, well, people gotta survive. Once the unimaginable happens you can finally accept the inevitable truth: that all things come to an end.\nAnd thank goodness for that, because an eternity of sameness would be awful. Without change, life has no meaning.\nThe process sure sucks sometimes, though :/\nAll any of us can do, unless we\u2019re filthy rich, is hang on and preserve what we can.

Ignore anything published by this self-serving think tank.\nIt\u2019s really kind of amazing that two months into Russia\u2019s unrelenting assault on Ukraine mainstream media outlets are still citing ISW.\nThe outlet, folks, offers little more than rank propaganda. Their analysts are shady and get facts wrong all the time.\nBBC map reporting ISW analysis. No attributions or citations exist anywhere on ISW\u2019s website for this map. No context is offered. It\u2019s basically made up, possible plagiarized from liveuamap\nFor the record, media, if you need to show a map please use liveuamap. Frankly I suspect ISW has simply been copying it throughout the conflict. Liveuamap is also better because it shows the location of social media reports of fighting which are more reliable than government data most of the time. Zoom in to look at the terrain and you can see how geography shapes military operations.\nLiveuamap from April 20th, as Russia\u2019s Donbas offensive begins. Estimated movement of forces mine, based on existing supply points and the terrain, which is more open west of Donbas proper and is experiencing a lot of Russian probing attacks and artillery, likely preparation for a big push on one or both fronts around Izium and Polohy. It\u2019ll be big and bad when it comes. Best of luck, Ukraine \u2014 I\u2019d be happy to help interpret satellite data for you if you need it but I suspect you\u2019re stacked with backup on the technical front. If not though\u2026 get in touch.\nThere is no more compelling example right now of how English-speaking media is dominated by pseudoscience than this organization. Its analysts have been wrong time and again about what is happening on the ground, predicting a Belarusian invasion of western Ukraine and amphibious assaults on Odesa long after these operations were no longer remotely likely. I don\u2019t think it is at all an exaggeration to say that ISW has intentionally joined the ongoing NATO information war designed to influence how everyone thinks about Ukraine\u2019s fight for freedom.\nOne of the biggest difficulties in writing about military conflicts is the fact that the information sphere is a conflict zone too. Since Putin unleashed his Orcs on Ukraine the self-described \u201cWestern\u201d media establishment has degenerated into a mirror image of its Russian counterpart.\nThis does not mean that the terrible facts on the ground being widely reported are false \u2014 Russian forces have committed unforgivable atrocities against Ukraine and its people and destroyed any chance of a ceasefire. What is happening in places like Mariupol and Kherson is genocide by any reasonable definition \u2014 Putin is deliberately changing the ethic character of these communities to destroy any Ukrainian identity and with it the prospect for an insurgency.\nCalling him a war criminal does nothing but give Biden temporary poll boosts, though. Talk is cheap \u2014 civilians in Ukraine continue to die.\nWhat is so broken about Western media coverage of Ukraine is its analysis of the facts. Having read a lot of primary sources describing the Eastern Front in the Second World War it has been frightening to see how quickly most writers\u2019 work degenerates into stale old tropes about faceless, murderous Russian soldiers.\nYes, many have proven monstrous in Ukraine \u2014 and wherever else they have fought, like Syria. This is largely a function of using so many conscript troops and maintaining the strong historic divide between the officer and enlisted classes \u2014 something that has absolutely contributed to America\u2019s awful record of committing atrocities in its wars too, My Lai, Haditha, and Abu Ghraib prominent among them.\nWhen soldiers don\u2019t know exactly what they are fighting for and aren\u2019t given the latitude to fight as the terrain and situation demands, they tend to take out their anger on civilians \u2014 this is sadly true of nearly every army in history.\nYet it is vitally important not to give in to the temptation to demonize and dehumanize the enemy. They are people too, just like us, even the ones who do horrible things. You\u2019ve likely never held a rifle and charged into a building held by hostiles. I\u2019ve only done it in training, and let me tell you it\u2019s a trip. Failing to understand what the battlefield is really like puts all the personnel who have to fight on one at extreme risk and makes the necessary misery so much worse.\nWarfare is about people, never forget that.\nNow this doesn\u2019t excuse what Russian forces have done at all. But demonizing them does nothing to defeat them. In truth, it only makes an end to the fighting much harder to achieve and eliminates any chance of turning Russian military personnel against their regime.\nMedia cheer-leading gets soldiers killed on both sides, so I have little patience for it. It is one thing to celebrate a military victory like the heroic defense of Kyiv or the sinking of the Moskva. It\u2019s quite another to cast all Russians as subhuman and celebrate their suffering.\nYou know who was the last power who fought Russia and did that on a wide scale? Nazi Germany. There\u2019s a reason both Ukraine and Russia accuse each other of being Nazis despite this being true in neither case, save for a few exceptions like the doomed Azov fighters.\nRemember that to beat Putin means enlisting the support of regular Russians. Polls showing they support him are broken because people\u2019s natural tendency to say what they think they\u2019re supposed to as a member of whatever group they\u2019re part of is dramatically amplified in an authoritarian climate. Russians are as alienated and dominated and fed misinformation as everyone else in the Western World and sincere belief is expressed through direct action, not responding to polls, which is why it\u2019s so hard to measure and pundits are surprised so often.\nOne of the most enduring tropes to emerge from the Second World War was the misbegotten idea that Russian soldiers are dumb subhuman brutes. Never mind that Russia has seized huge chunks of Ukraine\u2019s territory and has the reserves it needs to leave the country a shattered warzone indefinitely \u2014 all Russian successes are ignored while the debacles are mocked.\nThis is in fact an old trope that emerged from Western scholars who were mostly reading German sources about the Eastern Front during the Cold War. Few aside from David Glantz are willing to let the Russians of that era tell their own story, most clearly believe that because Russians are supposedly not truly Western their ideas have no merit and they are always lying. So Americans by and large have no idea how creative and capable Russians can actually be \u2014 especially when they get away from their officers and the perils of their formal education in Russian military science.\nThere\u2019s a simple reason that despite failing to take or encircle Kyiv Russian forces have steadily advanced in Ukraine\u2019s south and east: not all the Russian commanders are total morons. The fact it\u2019s the guy who oversaw the successful breakout from Crimea that Putin has put in charge of the broader war effort says something important.\nIf you go back and read ISW\u2019s regular briefings over the past two months it should be apparent how utterly wrong the analysts there have been. And not only about stuff that they can be forgiven for \u2014 it\u2019s very hard to predict where a military campaign will go on the ground because of all the unknowns an analyst can\u2019t account for. But looking back at my own pieces I\u2019ve been more right than wrong and definitely more reliable than ISW despite having nothing but open source reports and solid theory to rely on.\nNow, I didn\u2019t think Putin would take the risk of pulling the bum rush on Kyiv he tried \u2014for the exact reasons it didn\u2019t work out so well. Too few troops, tough terrain, and a country willing to fight to the last made taking Kyiv this past winter or some point in the future extremely unlikely.\nNo one should ever forget how think tanks like ISW insisted Kyiv would swiftly fall in days up right until it didn\u2019t \u2014 indeed almost every Western voice from Joe Biden on down insisted Ukraine was doomed for so long it\u2019s a miracle it actually wasn\u2019t. This self-centered move was clearly intended to insulate Biden\u2019s Administration from accusations of not seeing what was coming and served as a powerful excuse to rule out what Biden should have done once he knew, as he claims to, that Putin was about to strike: deploy American forces to Ukraine to deter Russia from hitting a country America and NATO both call an ally but refuse to treat it like one.\nZelensky is right \u2014 had Ukraine been given the heavy weapons it\u2019s finally receiving today last January Russia might well have been deterred from invading at all. Western leaders sent every signal to Putin that they wouldn\u2019t stop an attack and would instead fund an insurgency, which he clearly took as the sign of weakness it was.\nHad Ukraine\u2019s brave people not fought with all their might to repel the invasion Kyiv today could well be under occupation. America and its NATO allies refused to give Ukraine heavy weapons for weeks under the pretense that Russia might widen the war only to now turn around and do exactly that when it\u2019s too late to reinforce the almost-surrounded Ukrainian forces in Donbas.\nThey had better hope Russia\u2019s military is as incompetent as they say and NATO isn\u2019t the shell I suspect it is. Russia recently sent a diplomatic note warning of \u201cunpredictable consequences\u201d if NATO continues arming Ukraine. If Russia chooses to bomb some airfields in NATO territories, what\u2019s Biden gonna do then? Hit them back despite the risk of a nuclear escalation?\nUnlikely, even if by all rights NATO arms deliveries mean it\u2019s probably a legal party to the war. There remains a real outside chance that Russia will use submarines or long range missiles to destroy equipment bound for Ukraine while retaining a degree of plausible deniability \u2014 and what will America do about it? Accept that World War 3 might have begun and strike back?\nDoubtful. That\u2019s not the play Western leaders want to make. This war holds too many opportunities for them so long as they can dance close to the edge of the fire without getting burned.\nISW and other American propaganda outlets masquerading as scientific research organizations use the fact that very few Americans have any training in military science to understand just how badly they\u2019re being lied to. They never reveal what raw data they have that lets them make sweeping judgements about Russia\u2019s intentions and capabilities. If you follow them closely \u2014 folks like Michal Kofman are almost as bad about this and Iraq War booster Fred Kagan\u2019s Critical Threats Project is the worst of all \u2014 they rarely present hard evidence for major claims and are never honest about their intellectual assumptions.\nMost of what they publish is space-filling nonsense that tries to apply the narrow intellectual schema preferred by Western military professionals to evaluate military conflicts in what is a qualitatively different situation than any they\u2019ve experienced before. It is very interesting that a defense establishment that utterly failed to win in twenty years of War on Terror despite killing tens of thousands of civilians and thousands of American military personnel is acting like it actually has scientific credibility when it criticizes Russian military operations American and NATO forces would struggle to replicate.\nThat is part of the reason why these analysts make claims like the silly idea that if Russia doesn\u2019t take the town of Slovyansk southeast of Izium their entire operation in Donbas has failed. Their game is to establish a goal that doesn\u2019t make much sense or follow Russian tactics so far, which have been to suppress built up areas with artillery while driving their troops around them \u2014 smarter than storming dug-in troops.\nBut by setting an objective for Russia that doesn\u2019t make much sense, like storming Kyiv with far too few troops to hold a city of that size, these analysts then can turn around and say Russia has failed when it doesn\u2019t do what they insist it should. The situation in Mariupol is another good example \u2014 it\u2019s holding out because Russia has no reason to expend a lot of blood to take what Ukraine can\u2019t liberate. Now that the port and major roads are secured, what happens in the Azov steel plant is irrelevant and, in truth, leaving the soldiers trapped in Mariupol to fight to the last was a brutal move on Ukraine\u2019s part I suspect won\u2019t gain it much in the end since the forces in Mariupol have been isolated for weeks.\nRussia\u2019s success or failure in Donbas depends on how much firepower it can bring to bear on targeted sections of the Ukrainian lines. If, as I expect, an initial massive attack is too heavy to stop or slow down, Russia can probably cut off Donbas from resupply or reinforcement. These basic facts are driving how the battle is unfolding already, with Russia embarking on a long period of softening up of positions with artillery and air strikes while pushing a few columns of tanks forward to do recon. Once they fix Ukrainian defenders in place and degrade them they will unleash an overwhelming assault \u2014 the question then will be whether Ukraine can counterattack and encircle those trying to do the same to them.\nBut just like Russia, the West has its own intellectual heritage that colors thinking on defense matters, and just like Russia its preferred mode of military science is caught in self-deluding ideological traps. Both refuse to adopt a truly systems oriented view driven by resources and landscapes and instead reify beliefs that serve the interests of the officer class. Military education is indoctrination into a way of thinking about conflict that blinds the student to alternative methods, which is why regular armies struggle so mightily against insurgencies or \u2014 in Ukraine\u2019s case \u2014 a smart defender using decentralized tactics.\nMilitary science is the ultimate test bed for all social science, and if a decade of working in academia taught me one thing it\u2019s that the social sciences like economics, politics, and sociology are barely truly scientific if at all. I hold a couple masters degrees in interdisciplinary social science fields and completed all the coursework and research required for a doctorate before bailing out of the pyramid scheme that is academia.\nIf you want to be successful in this world and become the kind of expert who can talk to the media and make assertions without anyone fact checking you, a PhD is a must. Earned by making 5 or so other people with PhDs agree you deserve one too, there are no real quality controls on the process. Anyone who sucks up to the right people long enough can get a PhD because doctoral advisers have an incentive to take on students who do free work for them.\nHard sciences produce results that can be replicated \u2014 this is why I always worked to incorporate systems theory and science in my work. But the replication crises in the social sciences means that few research papers are actually as strong as you might believe. Peer review has been badly gamed out by academics who carefully build professional networks.\nIn academia, the key is selecting your peers. That\u2019s how you get publications in high-ranked outlets and fancy National Science Foundation grants, and how \u201celite\u201d universities hoover up so much funding despite their professors not in fact being any more capable than those working at a community college. That\u2019s the way the pyramid scheme works, though \u2014 eliteness is protected even if it\u2019s an utter sham.\nMedia outlets, even ones I generally respect like the BBC, uncritically use the products of think tanks like these and get away with it by being able to call the analysts experts. And this has led to most media outlets during the Ukraine war becoming conduits for propaganda.\nThink tanks survive by offering content that looks scientific to the right audience. And in a war, we\u2019re all trained to believe what our side says is true. So a nasty system is generated where a cadre of experts can bluff that they have more scientific understanding than anyone else without being taken to task. Americans in particular are not taught the philosophy or history of science except, for the most part, in graduate school where the purpose is determining which particular sub-philosophy you\u2019ll affiliate with, whether one driven by classical liberalism, critical theory, postmodernism, or something more esoteric.\nA major war offers opportunities for all kinds of entrepreneurs, and think tanks are rising up to play an adjunct role to the NATO military effort against Russia. NATO and Russia are effectively at war already \u2014 NATO weapons are killing Russians every day, after all \u2014 with how far and fast the conflict escalates now being a function of how quickly Donbas falls. ISW appears to understand this, and so publishes analysis intended to be spread across the English-speaking media that work to shape how the public thinks about the fight.\nThe basic objective of ISW is to make the case for Ukraine being NATO\u2019s front line defense against Russia and promote a forever war where American arms manufacturers make incredible profits and the bloodshed never ends. Part of the reason Russian atrocities, as disgusting and criminal as they are, are being pushed across people\u2019s TV screens right now is that this helps justify continued halfassed support of Ukraine \u2014 never enough for Kyiv to win, but enough to keep the fighting going for months or even years.\nThat is naturally being connected in most analysis I see to a supposed looming confrontation between the West and China. This Second Cold War is the last hope of the centrist elitists who run most Western democracies, especially dying America, desperate for a reason to not split into more functional smaller countries each following the Constitution as their voters prefer.\nIn general, you know you\u2019re being lied to in American society whenever team sports metaphors start being deployed. The goal in using them is to set an arbitrary standard for public debate, pushing the rest of us to abandon critical thought and do whatever rich people or celebrities say we should after accepting the terms they get to lay out because they\u2019re popular.\nMeanwhile, anything resembling truth is thrown aside. Russian forces are constantly said to be incompetent, poorly led, have terrible morale, and worse equipment. Certainly many are, yet nobody seems to realize that making this case of all Russians in fact denigrates all the successes Ukrainians have sacrificed for. Thousands of Ukrainian soldiers are dead and thousands more wounded, which is not a sign of the enemy\u2019s incompetence. Yes Russia has lost three times as many people\u2014 but it has around ten times more personnel to lose, the blood Russia can expend limited only by how total Putin is willing to make his war.\nIt\u2019s a characteristic of the wretched logic loops Western Liberalism relies on to function that commentators never seem to feel the need to acknowledge that not every Russian is represented by the actions of the worst among their comrades. One of the oft-repeated assertions over the past weeks has been that Russian morale is trash \u2014 if that\u2019s the case, though, why are Russian soldiers not surrendering in droves like Iraqi soldiers did in 1991? Why have they been successful in nearly surrounding Donbas in a careful, deliberate campaign over the past two months that has taken most of Ukraine\u2018s coastline?\nQuestions like these aren\u2019t supposed to be asked. Liberalism is the ideology of categories, where argument and debate are used to decide who and what belongs where. It\u2019s an intellectual shortcut that winds up serving the powerful and no one else, which is why commentators expend so much effort creating imaginary worlds for us to believe in, places where our feelings about Ukraine and Russia have real impacts on the battlefield.\nAn illusion, but no less profitable for that!\nThe truth is that the performance of military units varies tremendously even within a single country. Warfare isn\u2019t a team sport, it\u2019s applied resource management requiring that thousands of people coordinate effectively. Few leaders do it well, the best emerge only once war has broken out and their side has suffered setbacks.\nAs the postwar order steadily collapses in on itself thanks to the inability of global leadership to perceive what rising inequality is doing or to effectively respond, a lot of powerful people can be expected to cope by creating narratives those who depend on them are forced to believe in to have a voice in wider society. It\u2019s an old, classically human response that scholars of Liberalism refuse to acknowledge because change kills their paradigm and renders the holy priests of this secular religion powerless.\nThe priestly caste always protects itself. And Western philosophy is no less tribal than any other no matter how its bigoted backers insist otherwise. Russians are okay to portray as subhuman barbarians because that\u2019s the norm in the West, and Western scholars love to pretend their science is fully objective.\nIt isn\u2019t. It can\u2019t be. But that won\u2019t stop them from pretending otherwise to protect their jobs and privilege.\nI\u2019ve written before that I understand war better than any American, and I stand by this boast. My reasoning? No one else that I\u2019m aware of has experienced military life at the bottom rung after completing a Berkeley degree or used the lessons learned in military life to build a systems based theoretical paradigm that is proving remarkably good at predicting the future.\nDoing science, in other words, though most believers in the faith of Liberalism no longer accept that science is about generating reliable explanations that allow people to predict the future. Their vision of science is one of endless self-serving debate among humanity\u2019s educated betters that winds up becoming a religion too inflexible to serve in times of change.\nGive me the money, time, and staff and I\u2019ll build a systems-based modeling system that turns warfare into a true science that helps people stop wars from breaking out in the first place. It could be so sophisticated that it could even replace open warfare and allow anyone to prove their mettle in a digital setting that doesn\u2019t require human suffering.\nUnfortunately, virtually no one in a position of responsibility wants something like that to exist because if you can predict the future you have a responsibility to do something about it. Action endangers the status quo of Liberalism, so public professions of belief are substituted for doing anything.\nThe people who get rich spouting the doctrines they favor promote successors who learn fast to toe the official line if they want to keep their jobs. It does not pay to be a dissident in an academic discipline, not when no one can ever prove your theories so wrong your peers abandon their wrong beliefs.\nThe war commentators don\u2019t get called out as they should. And in the meantime, the people of Ukraine continue to die, Never Again relegated to the slogan it always has been, spoken by people who time and again refuse to act to stop genocide in places like Rwanda and too often promote slaughters of their own.\nPeople in Mariupol apparently don\u2019t deserve the help of the mighty West because the risk of nuclear war that would hurt us and especially our leaders is too high. That\u2019s the hell of Liberalism \u2014 once you\u2019ve been categorized as lesser other people have no obligation to come to your aid, their reluctance justified by the powerful.\nLiberalism is alienation, whether in its conservative or progressive flavor. It\u2019s a dead faith, and the slaughter in Ukraine proves it, because both NATO and Russia embrace liberalism, only different forms. One kills you for what you say, the other kills you for who you were born.\nWar is resource conflict, plain and simple. The techniques and tactics used by combatants all lead to the same end: someone seizes control of vital terrain, usually physical, sometimes purely metaphorical. War doesn\u2019t even have to be violent at all, it is made so by people who don\u2019t personally suffer the consequences.\nIn the information war over Ukraine, your thoughts and beliefs are the battlefield. That is why it\u2019s so important to be skeptical of everyone\u2019s claims, especially those made by white people with PhDs in the soft sciences.\nUnder the hood of most of their expert claims are dangerously outdated philosophical beliefs that have spent the past half century studiously ignoring the power of systems theory and science. Too many people with PhDs are terrified of math or any form of truly rigorous analysis and all fight to protect the system that empowers them, offering lifetime employment and the ability to mold students to those able to claw their way to the top \u2014 usually on the backs of people the system screwed over.\nUnless they can demonstrate real-world relevance in the same way Covid vaccines and climate studies have, it is time to ignore them. Especially when they talk about war. Few have seen it up close. Those who have are routinely silenced by the war cheerleaders serving profiteers, otherwise the main veterans voices you\u2019d hear are those of folks like Joseph Kassabian or Danny Sjursen.\nI do hope Ukraine can win and take back all its lands. I hope Putin falls and Russia rejoins the democratic world.\nBut I know that if these pseudo-experts have their way, none of this is possible. These people want a forever war and they\u2019ll say whatever is required to make us all pay for it for the rest of our lives.\nBe wary. For as the saying goes, you may not care much about war but it is greatly interested in you.", "comment_count": 5, "like_count": 490, "created_time": 1650554028006, "comment": [{"user_id": "869f66f3cda", "comment_time": 1650554028006, "comment": "Thank you for sharing!"}, {"user_id": "6609da471cf8", "comment_time": 1650644314037, "comment": "A question is just how awful?

Even more so, they are usually made by \u201cartists\u201d. But what if I told you that you don\u2019t need to be an artist to make funny comics that can help your mental health? What if you just take the stressor that is making you sad and anxious and make fun of it? Bad drawing skills are welcome and no one even has to see it!\nDisclaimer: Keep in mind that I am not a mental health professional, so please seek a professional therapist if you are feeling unwell.\nWhy Journaling?\nA while ago I came across the idea of journaling for mental health (you can read about it in this post from the University of Rochester, or this story by Aunty Sal, and this story by Karen Nimmo). Although there are many different types of journals you can make, including the one I am writing about, most therapists or self-help authors will advise you to track down your thoughts with the aim of identifying patterns of negative thoughts, which you can then address in therapy.\nMy Story\nWhen I heard about journaling I wanted to give it a try, but writing down any negative thoughts I had felt like giving them too much importance. Surely these thoughts about self-doubt and fear don\u2019t deserve to be written down! Instead, I took a different approach: What if I made fun of them? And that\u2019s what I did.\nI bought a journal with pre-made squares (combating that blank page fear!). Without any hope to make nice drawings, I just drew myself as a stick woman and some anxieties and fears flying around me, both drawn and written in text. And then I started making fun of them. In the beginning my humor was a bit crude, but as I had more and more ideas, my comics and their humor developed their own style. One of my favorite and surprisingly introspective comics is this one in two parts:\n\u201cMy inner self comic\u201d, created by the author, Ana Krajinovi\u0107, (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)\n\u201cMy inner self explained\u201d comic, created by the author, Ana Krajinovi\u0107, (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)\nComic Journaling in Steps\nSo, if you are at all interested in giving this method a go, these would be the steps to follow:\nThe mindful person that you are, recognize the negative thought or the anxiety that is troubling you. This could be something as simple as being unable to make a decision on what to eat or something more serious, like being unemployed.\nFind a contradiction in this negative thought. There is always one, unless you are going through a really serious problem, in which case you might skip the comedic aspect of this exercise. An example of a contradiction is if you already know the steps that will take you to the solution of your problem, but you are not taking any action (because you are afraid or unmotivated to do it). You might be afraid to start applying for jobs and doing all the research around it (=solution), but you actually do want a job.\nDraw this contradiction with stick (wo)men or any other means! You can draw yourself acting in this contradictory way or you can give a physical representation to your anxiety. For example, a circle with the word \u201cproblem\u201d on it is now representing your problem (see an example with \u201cyou are fat\u201d below). Either way, it will feel good to see them battling on paper instead of tormenting your head.\nLaugh at your comic.\nKeep the comic for yourself or decide to show it to a few close friends.\nA panel from a comic created by the author, Ana Krajinovi\u0107, (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)\nGood Side Effects\nNow, I don\u2019t make these comics every day, but every time I recognize a conflict between my negative thoughts and the objective voice of reason, I draw it. There is something utterly satisfying about seeing these thoughts drawn and laughed at. It feels like they have been defeated by the power of humor and laughter.\nAnother important aspect of this exercise is that it makes you feel productive and creative. You draw it and write it and the comic is there: your own creation looking at you. I feel we don\u2019t do enough of such creations these days anymore.\nI hope this story has intrigued you to try to make fun of your inner contradictions.

What an existence.\nAt least we can always crack jokes at it. Just like my grandma said the last time she danced in our apartment: \u201cThat\u2019s right my dear. There is always a reason to laugh.

We consume and immerse ourselves constantly in stories of all shapes and sizes through novels, comics, movies, video games, among others. But what makes or breaks a story? Why do some stories stay in our memory forever and others are immediately forgotten? There are two basic ingredients done right in a great story: They are relatable, but also innovative.\nRelatability\nWhat does it mean for a story to be relatable? On the most basic level, this means that the story is understandable. You can only get what is happening in a story if the characters, their actions, and their consequences make sense to you. Imagine if you watched a movie made for an alien culture. You probably wouldn\u2019t understand a thing because their way of life would be so different from anything we experience here on Earth.\nEvery story makes assumptions about what the audience knows. And these assumptions need to be correct for the story to make sense. However, good stories are not only understandable. They go one level higher and become relatable to the audience. This means that the readers and watchers can identify with the characters: Maybe the same or similar things have happened to them before. Maybe they faced the same obstacles.\nIdentifying with characters in this way makes the audience care for the characters. The audience becomes invested in the plot and this is where the magic happens: We become immersed in the story and we get to feel like we are a part of it, experiencing all the ups and downs together with the characters.\nWhen I try to come up with relatable stories that can awake a deep emotional connection with the reader, I start with true stories from my personal life. I am only at the beginning of my storytelling journey, so it makes sense that the best stories I can come up with are the ones that are true because they are the most relatable ones. I have listed a few of them below.\nThe Messy Truth About Santa and How I Found Out\nIs it any good making kids believe in Santa?medium.com\nWhy Humor Allows Us to Overcome the Tragedy of Life And Death\nOr why life and death are one big cosmic joke.medium.com\nThe Quiet Strength of \u201cOrdinary\u201d Women\nTwo inspiring personal stories that will change how you see female strength.medium.com\nSo, if you want to make a story relatable: Think personally (what happened to you) and think about who would relate to it. That is your audience. For example, I often make comics about linguistics. These will be generally most well understood by linguists. I also make comics and write about mental health. This will be well understood by people who suffer from certain mental health problems or are interested in wellbeing.\nAnd I also make stories about life, relationships, loss, and humor. I think these have the highest potential to be understood by almost everyone, although even here there might be a generational or a cultural gap, depending on the topic. For instance, a young person who hasn\u2019t lost anyone might not relate to loss and grief.\nOk, so we have established that a story needs to be understandable and relatable, which means somewhat similar to the experiences we all share. But what happens when we\u2019ve seen similar stories over and over again? Well, we quickly get bored of them and they become clich\u00e9s, even if they are relatable. So, the only way to keep your story interesting is to add an innovative element.\nCreated by the author.\nInnovation\nBy innovation here I refer to all the elements of your story that are somewhat unexpected. This could be a twist in the end, done in a way that is not often seen in other movies or novels, or it could be an introduction of a quirky character that is not a typical protagonist. If you are basing yourself on a true story, you might highlight an aspect of it that doesn\u2019t frequently happen in the lives of other people.\nAnd most importantly, every story, true or not, can easily become creative and innovative simply by focusing on aspects of it that are not frequently the main focus in other (mainstream) stories. Since we are constantly bombarded by stories everywhere we go, we develop a sort of literacy for how a story is usually told. We learn to expect the twists and turns we see very often. That is why we often guess who is going to betray whom in a movie, or that the couple in a romantic comedy will definitely end up together in the end.\nHowever, if you decide to shift your focus to a more nuanced conflict, or if you slow down the pace, when most other stories are super fast, you will find yourself in the territory of innovation. So, keep an eye on what is not being done elsewhere and try it out! It might not work, but it might just be the creative spark you were looking for.\nYou might ask: Why is innovation even necessary? Common motifs and clich\u00e9s are not always bad, they can make us feel good. Well, besides making us feel good, excellent stories also teach us something. If we feel that a story is telling us something we already know, in a way that we have seen before, it will just feel like a rerun of other stories, and it won\u2019t stick with us.\nPhoto by Patrick Tomasso on Unsplash\nPutting it together\nThe amazing thing about great stories is that they talk about well-known emotions or situations that everyone has experienced but in a new way.\nThink about Pixar\u2019s Inside Out, one of my all-time favorite films. The plot of the film is about basic emotions: joy, sadness, anger, fear, and disgust, and most of the situations are based on everyday events. But the way these very well-known concepts are developed is truly unique, from imagining that the basic emotions are little humans on their own to all the fantastical things happening inside the human brain. But the most original idea of all is how all these innovative concepts relate to the known everyday situations.\nThere is no way around it. Relatability makes us understand the stories and innovation makes us love them for shining a new light on something we thought we knew well.\nIf you liked this, click follow and subscribe to my newsletter Ana\u2019s stories.", "comment_count": 3, "like_count": 219, "created_time": 1645023254413, "comment": [{"user_id": "46a464f68412", "comment_time": 1645023254413, "comment": "Thank you for sharing!"}, {"user_id": "36e8609b3176", "comment_time": 1646257186232, "comment": "Some good thoughts and recommendations here!

With this new ability, your understanding of rhetoric and composition grew, and so did your ability to persuade your audience.\nBut there\u2019s something your English teacher never told you \u2014 something most teachers hate to admit.\nFirst off, it\u2019s okay to break the rules. Beginner writers often struggle with this. They flip and flop, because they are unable to control the effects of their writing without the fences grammatical structure provides. Good intentions only go so far.\nBut for well-seasoned writers, breaking the rules can be an incredibly effective technique. After all, sometimes you have to tear down the fence before you can see beyond it.\nTake Cormac McCarthy for example. A handful of novels and a pocket full of missing punctuation later, and the author has developed a unique sense of style (not to mention a multi-million dollar net-worth).\nSimilarly, numerous essayists, novelists, and short-story writers have composed compelling work unbridled by the English handbook, writers like Ray Bradbury, Sherman Alexie, and Zora Neale Hurston who captured class and culture and dialect in wonderfully unique ways.\nProse aside, no one knows how to break rules more effectively than modern poets: Anita Endrezze, Brian Patten, Ocean Vuong. If you want to see beautiful rule breaking, treat yourself to some quality free verse.\nBut let\u2019s get back to the point.\nIf you are going to break the rules of writing, then you need to know the rules first.\nYou need to know them inside out. You need to understand the intentions and the effects of those rules so that when, and if, you choose to break them, you can do so successfully.\nIf you tell an amateur writer to start breaking the rules BEFORE he or she learns what they are and why they are there, then you\u2019ll end up with an incomprehensible load of gibberish that takes longer to decipher than it does to write.\nThis is why teachers don\u2019t give this advice.\nWriters who lack experience have the unique ability to completely misjudge the quality of their work.\nAnd they struggle with constructive criticism.\nIf you tell a young writer that something isn\u2019t working in their writing, then you may as well cut them off from readers for the unforeseeable future, because they\u2019re going to bury themselves in a hole until they remember why they wanted to be writers in the first place, and then maybe they\u2019ll have the courage to dig themselves back out again and share a small sample of their work with a gentle, trust-worthy friend who probably won\u2019t give them the honest response they deserve.\nReaders don\u2019t want to read the same thoughts regurgitated in the same way over and over again on the blank page. Readers want to see a splash of color in an otherwise painfully black-and-white world. They want to see work that breathes easily into existence, work that goes above traditional expectations and beyond.\nThey want to see what you see the way you see it, not the way you were told to see it, or the way you were told to tell others what you see. See what I mean?\nIf you try to blindly follow the rules, your writing will become unnatural, stilted. Fake.\nYou were told to write in complete sentences.\nYou were told to always make pronouns and antecedents agree in number.\nYou were told not to use first person and opinions in your writing.\nYou were told not to end sentences with prepositions.\nYou were told not to start your sentences with \u201cand\u201d or \u201cbut.\u201d\nBut when you break the rules intentionally, something magical happens.\nThe most effective writing is the kind of writing you forget you\u2019re reading.\nIn other words, your writing must enter the mind of readers as if it were their own thoughts.\nTony Ardizzone, my first creative writing teacher, taught me this one, simple lesson: You must learn the rules before you can successfully break them.\nI\u2019ve done my time. I\u2019ve learned the rules. And now I\u2019m breaking them, one by one.\nI was lucky enough to have a professor willing to share this advice \u2014 it gave me something to word toward \u2014 and now, as an English teacher, I feel compelled to do the same.\nUse it wisely.\nIf you would like to support this teacher\u2019s writing endeavors, consider joining Medium.

The conversation started around a video featuring Dan Shutes, a 5th grade teacher and content creator, whose \u201cunpopular opinions\u201d went viral on TikTok.\nIn the video, Mr. Shutes argues that \u201celementary students should NOT have homework,\u201d and this point resonated deeply with my high school students. This was the ultimate takeaway from our discussion:\nA lot of assigned work \u2014 in all grades \u2014 requires little thought.\nWork that doesn\u2019t really strengthen skills is typically deemed \u201cbusy work,\u201d or work that is meant to keep students occupied. Despite the lack of skills required and the lack of skills gained as a result of this kind of work, it\u2019s still assigned. Regularly.\nHere\u2019s the problem:\nWhen adults are overburdened with work, they begin to hate their jobs, and before long they dread going to work in the morning. Likewise, when students \u2014 especially elementary students \u2014 are overburdened with work, they begin to hate learning, and they dread going to school.\nAnd if this starts in elementary school and continues up through high school graduation\u2026well, you can see why the problem escalates from there.\nI hate busy work. My fellow teachers, however, argue that students \u201cmust stay busy,\u201d and if the extra work is not finished during class, then the students must finish it at home.\nBut the problem is that the students are busy.\nStudents in the United States work around 38 hours a week \u2014 full time \u2014 because they are constantly in school. No, they aren\u2019t getting paid for those hours (unless you count education as \u201cpayment\u201d), but these hours do not include the 3+ hours of homework students are regularly assigned each night or their extracurricular activities, which sometimes take entire afternoons and weekends.\nFor older students like mine, jobs outside of school quickly tack on hours to that total.\nOne of my senior students (18) worked a full 35 hours outside of class last week, and yet she was still present in school every day. In what world does a 73-hour week not count as busy?\nPeople wonder why anxiety, stress, and depression are increasing at exponential levels in underage students. This is why.\nThey\u2019re overworked. The culture of America emphasizes work over happiness, and it\u2019s infecting our children generation after generation \u2014 only the American dream isn\u2019t part of the deal anymore.\nSo why is it, then, that we need to add busy work to students\u2019 already overburdened schedules if they happen to finish something early during class?\nThat time is valuable. Students could use it to do homework from other classes so they aren\u2019t up until 2 or 3 in the morning. They could use it to make up quizzes and missing assignments from when they were out sick. Or \u2014 and this is just a thought \u2014 they could use that time to rest, read for pleasure, or talk to their friends (and in a world dominated by technology, face-to-face communication is becoming a lost skillset).\n\u201cIf students don\u2019t take advantage of the time given in class, then we need to add an activity to keep them actively engaged in learning.\u201d\nI get the reasoning behind it. I do. Why waste time? Why not constantly learn things and emphasize the importance of learning?\nThere is logic behind this, but the solution to this perceived problem is ineffective.\nAdding extra work overburdens the students who are taking advantage of the time in class to work, and the extra work just gives the students who aren\u2019t taking advantage of it another assignment they won\u2019t have the time, energy, or willpower to complete, which will just lower their grades even more.\nBusy work doesn\u2019t help anyone. It doesn\u2019t even help the teacher, who likely has over 150 students between sections. If you add two busy-work assignments per week and they only take 2 minutes each to grade, that\u2019s still an additional 10 hours of unnecessary work.\nTeachers could be using that time to give more meaningful feedback and attention to students. Instead, they\u2019re overloaded with unnecessary tasks that drain them even after hours. (I can\u2019t tell you how many teachers come in early, stay after school, and work away their weekends, unpaid.)\nTeachers are burnt out, too. It\u2019s an epidemic. Nearly every state struggles with a teacher shortage, and yet the cycle carries on.\nIt\u2019s time to break the cycle.\nInstead of giving students work that they don\u2019t need to do, it would be better to focus on project-based learning. Skill over participation.\nI\u2019ve seen it work.\nI used to teach at a private school that was mindful of the student workload. Homework could only be assigned for specific subjects on specific days, and that homework was limited to 30 minutes. Everything else had to be done in the classroom.\nFrom a teacher\u2019s perspective, there are two kinds of assignments that matter: formative and summative. Formative work includes classwork, notes, participation, while summative work includes essays, tests, and finals.\nWhen I worked at that private school, everything up until midterms had to be formative with the goal of building the skills required for the summative(s).\nThe skills that students demonstrated in those summative assignments determined the grades they got in the class, and formative assignments were used to inform the end-of-year grade ONLY if the summative assignments did not provide enough or consistent information.\nThe students there loved to learn, and their skillset reflected their engagement: I had 8th graders who wrote better than some freshman college students.\nWhen I switched to public school, those sharp writing skills quickly plummeted.\nWhen I started working in public school, most of my students in 10th grade wrote like the private school students I had in 6th grade \u2014 even though some of the 6th graders were actually better at writing analytical paragraphs. This was a disheartening realization.\nI felt like I was going backwards, not forwards, and the students felt like their skills were superior because they were older.\nI told them, \u201cAge doesn\u2019t matter. Skills matter.\u201d No one heard me.\nSadly, I have also seen students pass classes because they completed all of the assigned busy work, but the actual skills demonstrated in their essays and their finals indicated that they were not ready to move forward. In other words, the busy work padded their grades.\nWhat does this tell us about education in America? Well, it tells us that numbers lie.\nThe system in place rejects project-based learning. Rules like \u201cteachers must enter at least 3 assignments in the gradebook per week\u201d plague teacher inboxes and upset the value of learning.\nThese ideas are outdated. If teachers assign 3 projects in one week, the workload becomes not only overwhelming, but impossible. That\u2019s why so many public school teachers lean on easily-graded assignments and multiple choice questions. They\u2019re trying to survive.\nWhen students graduate, they need to understand how to handle a project, manage their time, and demonstrate their understanding of the material. They aren\u2019t going to be taking multiple-choice tests for a living, but they are going to need work-life balance, which is something public schools keep forgetting.\nEffort, quality, creativity.\nWe need to encourage the love of learning in our students from childhood to adulthood. It is the only meaningful lesson we can teach them, and perhaps the only lesson they won\u2019t forget.\nIf you would like to support this teacher\u2019s writing endeavors, consider joining Medium.

It was far enough from downtown to be away from the hustle and bustle, but it was close enough for a quick commute. For a while, we felt like we had it all.\nBut then things started to change.\nWithin only a few months, several of our neighbors sold their houses, and the people who bought them changed the neighborhood drastically. Suddenly it was all booming bases and large parties, junk cars and angry dogs.\nI remember one night the neighbor\u2019s base was so loud that it rattled the panes of glass in our windows, but no matter where we went \u2014 front yard, back yard, upstairs, downstairs \u2014 we couldn\u2019t get any privacy or peace.\nThat\u2019s when we decided to move. And several acres later, we are much happier \u2014 but moving from the city to the country wasn\u2019t an easy transition. There were, to say the least, a handful of surprises:\n1. The first thing I noticed was how dark it was at night.\nNo streetlights, no headlights, no houselights. When I stepped outside and turned off our porchlight, I was pitched into shadows thicker than any I had seen in the past ten years. At first, it was a little unsettling \u2014 we could hear animals rustling through dry leaves in the wooded hills, but we couldn\u2019t see them.\nAfter a few weeks, that darkness became more of a comfort. There is safety in solitude.\n2. From my experience, people in the country are drastically different than people in the city.\nAs soon as we moved, scowls shifted into smiles. Strangers would wave to us and ask us questions; they wanted to know who we were and where we were from. When we bought straw to lay over our freshly seeded lawn, another customer even offered to help us load the bales into our vehicle.\nYour environment can craft your entire outlook on life. It matters.\n3. When we moved out of the city, there was a drastic political shift.\nRepublican flags decorated houses and lawns, and \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hats sat on the counters at hardware stores, waiting to be sold, bought, and worn.\nGuns became a regular part of conversation, too \u2014 where to shoot, what you shoot, how many guns you had to shoot \u2014 and while the sound of gunfire in the city had once been frightening, gunfire in the country became just another sound in the background.\nJust because something is different doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s bad, and just because something is the same doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s good. It\u2019s important to understand other people\u2019s perspectives.\n4. Our old neighborhood was pretty diverse \u2014 a mix of political views, religions, races, and languages \u2014 but when we moved, we (unintentionally) left that diversity behind.\nBetween home and work, it was impossible not to see these (literal) signs:\nA piece of wood nailed to a telephone pole: JESUS IS COMING\nA white sign beside an old road: CHRIST\u2019S CHURCH \u2192\nA handmade cross at the edge of an overgrown driveway\nA Jesus fish magnet and a bible quote on a rusty bumper\nIf you drive out into the deep countryside, you\u2019re bound to notice a cardboard Bigfoot silhouette or two as well, followed by a few silhouetted Bigfoot children.\nSigns tell you a lot about who lives around you \u2014 what they think, what\u2019s important to them, and what they care about. A lack of signs will tell you a lot about people, too.\n5. Indiana is one of the least educated states in America, but the biggest problem is the lack of common sense.\nParents teach their children to believe what they believe, and most often those parents grew up in the same area that their parents grew up in, and their grandparents before them \u2014 and they all pass down the same worldviews to their children.\nIn other words, the lack of common sense is a legacy passed down from one generation to another, and it stems from a lack of diverse worldviews and experiences.\nMark Twain would say these people suffer from \u201ccorn-pone opinions,\u201d which are opinions people have because they surround themselves with other people who have those opinions. Why would you need to think when you can just borrow the opinions of the people around you?\nPeople rarely ask why when they\u2019re told to do or believe something \u2014 especially when that command comes from a respected authority figure.\nAnd it\u2019s not that this doesn\u2019t happen in the city. Of course it does. But the more you travel and the more you read, the less of a problem it becomes.\nI miss the diversity and the convenience of the city, but I don\u2019t miss the city itself at all. I don\u2019t miss the smog, or the noise, or the litter. I don\u2019t miss the traffic, the potholes, or the crime.\nMoving to the country brought us peace. The wildlife, the sounds of nature. The fresh air, the stars at night. The hills and the valleys and the fields.\nIn a chaotic and uncertain world, living in the country feels safe \u2014 at least, as long as you have a few acres to hide in.\nIf you would like to support this teacher\u2019s writing endeavors, consider joining Medium.

Regardless of where you reside, change is coming, and not all of it is for the better.\nStress, anxiety, and depression are rampant. In the midst of it all, teachers are struggling to stay afloat, drowning in the strain of a pandemic-charged era. Even before covid-19, teachers were on edge, grappling with stagnant wages, increasing class numbers, and inadequate resources.\nThe reality is that these problems aren\u2019t going away \u2014 but the teachers are.\nFor those of you who haven\u2019t heard, here\u2019s what\u2019s going on in the teaching profession:\n1. Enrollment in education programs is on the decline.\nSource: NCES IPEDS and Department of Education Title II Data\nAbout ten years ago, between six and seven hundred thousand individuals were enrolling every year in education programs, but surveys indicate that enrollment is at a severe decline (\u201cThe Teachers are Not All Right\u201d).\nWhy are so many college students avoiding education majors?\nFor starters, they\u2019re listed among the worst college majors:\nSource: Federal Reserve Bank of New York\nSix out of ten of the worst college majors are directly linked to education. Isn\u2019t it ironic, then, that the people who teach students how to become successful in other professions come from studying an underpaid and unappreciated major that literally ranks at the bottom?\nIn an effort to persuade educators to stay, some people ignore the logic and appeal to the educator\u2019s sense of emotion instead: \u201cBut you didn\u2019t get into this profession for the money. You did it for the love of teaching.\u201d\nTrue. But a living wage matters, and educators cannot properly educate their students if they cannot afford to take care of themselves first.\n2. Financially, it just doesn\u2019t make sense to become an educator.\nPhoto by Towfiqu barbhuiya on Unsplash\nOn average, it costs $8,893 a year for in-state public tuition ($22,203 for out-of-state, $30,094 for private). That means that over the course of a bachelor\u2019s degree in education, one could spend anywhere between $35,572-$120,376.\nAnd with educator salaries starting as low as $33,000 a year, the problem becomes evident:\nWhy would someone put themselves into serious financial debt for an underappreciated profession that will not make a good return on the investment?\nWell, there is job security.\nIn Indiana alone, 96% of districts report teacher shortages. That means there are numerous positions waiting to be filled \u2014 even though people aren\u2019t filling them.\nKami\u2019s Teacher Wellbeing Report 2022\nConsider this: When a teacher leaves a profession and the position goes unfilled, the students that teacher taught are then placed into the classrooms of those who are still available. In turn, this causes those teachers to be overworked and overburdened.\nSo while there are plenty of teaching jobs, the gap is only widening, putting additional strain on the teachers sticking it out in the classrooms.\n3. Teachers do not have the respect, support, or the resources needed to succeed.\nPhoto by Yasin Yusuf on Unsplash\nIt is impossible to give students the attention they need with limited resources. More students per classroom means less time for individualized teaching and attention. In other words, students aren\u2019t getting the education they deserve.\nNot to mention, while there are less and less teachers, there are more and more students to teach.\nSource: Teachers of Tomorrow\nIf lack of enrollment were the only problem, we could focus our time and energy on making education programs more appealing \u2014 offering scholarships and incentives that would help draw new talent to the field.\nThat\u2019s great in theory, except we\u2019re losing too many of the teachers we already have, and with education program enrollment declining on top of this, we have to accept the fact that we just can\u2019t keep up with the numbers.\nFor starters, the baby-boomer generation is retiring from the workforce, and many teachers retired early because of the pandemic.\nPhoto by Huy Phan on Unsplash\nWith the most experienced generation of educators leaving the profession, that leaves even more strain on those who remain, which coincidentally pushes more teachers away.\nAccording to the National Education Association, 55% of teachers have recently considered leaving the profession early, regardless of age or experience, and a \u201cdisproportionate percentage of Black (62%) and Hispanic/Latino (59%) educators\u201d are considering leaving altogether, despite the lack of representation already in the field.\nPhoto by Clay Banks on Unsplash\nIt is difficult for educators to stay for numerous reasons, and these reasons have latched onto headlines with a level of ferocity unprecedented in previous years.\nLack of money, lack of respect. Lack of support, resources, time. There is never a surplus.\nTeachers are fighting inflation, and they are still paying for school supplies out of their own pockets. Over the past few years, they have worked not only as teachers, but as janitors, mental health counselors, nurses, and technologists.\nImage by Abbazia\nTeachers are teaching in a broken system. People attribute the failure of education to these individuals instead of to the system itself, and it\u2019s clear that for many former educators, the blame-game isn\u2019t worth playing anymore.\nWith school shootings on the rise, teachers not only have to worry about their safety and the safety of their students, but they also have to deal with contagious diseases, hybrid classrooms, and highly controversial education bills.\nTeachers have run out of breathing room.\nThe pandemic has changed the world forever. Education will never be the same. E-learning has put its stamp on the industry, and current and future educators are falling through the cracks.\nThe bright side? People are talking about it.\nEducation has become a buzzword, and those personally invested in the welfare of children\u2014 students, parents, teachers \u2014 have their eyes glued to the screen, constantly combing the headlines for the latest information that will make or break the profession.\nTalking about it isn\u2019t enough. It\u2019s time to act. The future of education \u2014 everyone\u2019s future \u2014 depends on it.\nIf you would like to support this teacher\u2019s writing endeavors, consider joining Medium.

You also know you\u2019re going to be tired all day tomorrow.\nBut here you are, staring at your bedside clock. Or worse, scrolling through your feeds without paying attention to anything in particular.\nWe\u2019ve all been there, and it happens more often than we\u2019d like to admit.\nInstead of feeling ashamed of it, let\u2019s talk about how to break out of the habit step by step.\n1. Set a Bedtime. Be Lenient But Be Persistent.\nThe first thing you have to do is decide when your bedtime is. It doesn\u2019t have to be very early, as long as you keep the following points in mind:\nYou need at least seven hours of sleep (or more, depending on your genetics).\nThere\u2019s no point going to bed at 9 PM on the weekdays and then staying up till dawn on the weekends. Pick a time that works for you every day, all year round.\nIt\u2019s OK to experiment with different bedtimes until you find one that works. If you decide to do this, make sure to maintain a sleep journal and track your findings. You could use the Sleep Foundation\u2019s template or come up with your own.\nYour bedtime shouldn\u2019t be too eccentric. You could damage your health if you routinely sleep during the day and stay awake at night.\nNow comes the tricky part: you must develop a healthy relationship with your bedtime. Treat it as a guideline to help you live well, not as a cast-iron rule.\nYour bedtime needs to be useful to you. It isn\u2019t a punishment or a test of character.\nIn my experience, being too rigid about going to bed at a specific time is counterproductive, and it can lead to those unhappy thought spirals that keep you awake.\nLet\u2019s say that something unexpected happened, or you got lost in a good conversation or a good book. You\u2019re already an hour past your bedtime. The best thing to do is shrug and try to go to bed as soon as possible. The worst thing to do is to feel guilty. Guilt will keep you awake.\nA Note to Parents: As a dad, this is a conflict I\u2019ve had to deal with often.\nKids need plenty of sleep to grow. If they don\u2019t go to bed in time, they\u2019ll wake up grumpy and it will become everyone\u2019s problem. But also, kids hate going to bed on time because there\u2019s so much to do!\nAll of the above advice applies to them too (except they need to sleep a few hours more). Being too rigid about enforcing a bedtime turns the whole thing into an ordeal. Have patience, be persistent, and try to show them how healthy sleeping habits work through your own behavior.\n\u201cThere is a time for many words, and there is also a time for sleep.\u201d \u2015 Homer, The Odyssey\n2. Find Your Ritual.\nEveryone has a wind-down ritual before bed, even if they don\u2019t realize it. Brushing your teeth, changing into comfortable clothes, taking out your contacts \u2014 all of that is a part of the ritual.\nBut I recommend building a more elaborate and deliberate ritual. Plan it out, write it down, add and remove items when necessary. This is helpful because it tells your brain it\u2019s time to switch to sleep mode. We\u2019re all creatures of habit, and repeating the same steps every night is comforting.\nThe steps I use, if you\u2019re curious:\nAt the end of my working day, I define two primary goals for the next day and write them down. If I miss out on this, I\u2019m guaranteed to stay up thinking about work.\nI dim the light and change into comfortable clothes. It\u2019s fine to do this early. If you leave it to the last minute, you might feel too tired and then you\u2019ll keep putting it off (and miss out on sleep).\nI write in my journal.\nAfter dinner, I put my phone aside. I usually watch TV for a while with my family, and then I go to bed and read a good book.\nOnce my eyelids are heavy, I put on my sleeping mask and drift off within minutes.\nI recommend doing things you like before bed. Enjoy some fiction, take a nice bath, let go of the daily grind. Life isn\u2019t just about self-discipline, it\u2019s about pleasure too.\n3. Set the Scene.\nSometimes, there is no great mystery behind why you can\u2019t fall asleep. The fault may lie in your bedroom.\nYou can\u2019t fall asleep easily in a noisy environment.\nFalling asleep became a thousand times easier for me after I invested in insulated double-pane windows. I wasn\u2019t even aware of how much the city noises got on my nerves. Now that there\u2019s true, blissful silence in the bedroom, sleep comes much more easily.\nIf sound-proofing isn\u2019t possible for you right now, try earplugs. You could also get a white noise machine. I\u2019m not a fan personally, but I know that this is highly individual, so it could be worth a shot.\nLight pollution could be a problem too. Even tiny light sources could cause you to stay up for no good reason. A silk sleeping mask can do wonders \u2014 total darkness tells your brain it\u2019s time to calm down.\nYour bedroom might be too warm. Scientists have found that \u201cheat exposure increases wakefulness and decreases slow wave sleep and rapid eye movement sleep.\u201d In other words, being too warm will keep you up and disrupt your REM cycle.\nThe best room temperature to fall asleep is between 60 and 67 degrees Fahrenheit (or 15.5 to 19.5 Celsius) according to Sleep.org. I checked my sleep journal and it turns out I sleep best when the temperature is between 18 and 21 degrees Celsius.\nYou have too many distractions at hand. Keeping the phone away from the bedroom really does work. I also recommend sleeping in a room with no television.\n4. Ask Yourself Whether There\u2019s a Bigger Problem Behind It.\nI recently learned an amazing term: \u5831\u5fa9\u6027\u71ac\u591c\u5831\u5fa9\u6027\u71ac\u591c, or revenge bedtime procrastination.\nThe phrase spread among Chinese social media users first, and then it was popularized in the English-speaking world by journalist Daphne K. Lee.\nShe explains that \u201cthe literal translation for revenge bedtime procrastination is \u201csuffering through the night vengefully.\u201d It describes a trend in which modern-day workers resist sleeping early to seize the freedom of the night hours \u2014 even if it brings no apparent benefits.\u201d\nThis phrase refers to a self-destructive behavior people engage in because they feel helpless. If you can\u2019t get to sleep on time, you might be rebelling against something without realizing it.\nMaybe you work too much or hate your job, your marriage isn\u2019t working well, you are unhappy with the state of your health \u2014 in short, something might be making you feel trapped.\nOf course, you don\u2019t want to live a life filled with nothing but sleep and fretting. You want privacy, some time for yourself, and a little bit of mindless relaxation.\nBut revenge bedtime procrastination doesn\u2019t make you feel happier. It just causes you to scroll through your feed or watch whatever\u2019s on Netflix. You\u2019ll do anything to avoid facing unpleasant thoughts or feeling like a caged tiger.\nSadly, this situation doesn\u2019t have an easy answer. But you do need to understand yourself and what you\u2019re going through.\nDon\u2019t get stuck in a cycle of insufficient sleep and unhappiness.\nIt could help to fix your sleeping habits before you tackle the big problems \u2014 but remember, you don\u2019t have to be perfect. Sleep half an hour more than usual, and things will already seem less grim and unsolvable.\n5. Don\u2019t Try to Fix Anything Once You\u2019re in Bed.\nAnother issue that keeps people up is endless, unproductive planning. If you aren\u2019t happy with the way your day went, you might spend hours in bed thinking about how you\u2019ll do better the next day.\nThis is a harmful, self-defeating habit. 3 AM resolutions are worse than New Year resolutions, there\u2019s no chance you\u2019ll actually keep them. To stop turning it around in your mind, I recommend journaling just to let go of your worries for the day.\nSimilarly, you may be tempted to get into an argument with your partner just before bed. Something went wrong between you, and now you want to repair it.\nAccording to psychologist Bobby Wegner, couples get in arguments late at night because everyone is \u201ctired and burnt out from the day and feels safest expressing emotion to their partner. It is the same philosophy as a kid holding it together all day in school and having a meltdown at home.\u201d\nBut, remember, you\u2019re not thinking and acting rationally when you\u2019re exhausted. Instead of making things better, you might say something you\u2019ll regret.\n+1. Think of Sleep as a Gift.\n\u201cEven a soul submerged in sleep is hard at work and helps make something of the world.\u201d \u2015 Heraclitus, Fragments\nUnfortunately, it\u2019s not always possible to eradicate insomnia with the power of positive thinking. Some people struggle so much with falling asleep that they have to ask for professional help (such as counseling for anxiety, etc).\nBut for most of us, it\u2019s enough to reframe the way we view sleep.\nYou\u2019re not missing out on life when you\u2019re asleep. Instead, you are gathering the strength you need to truly enjoy life. Your mind is going through your experiences, cataloging everything, so just let it do that and be grateful for it.\nWhen you put it like that, it\u2019s easier to get into that relaxed, content state of sleepiness.\nThe next time you\u2019re in bed, with your ritual all done, relax your shoulders, take a deep breath, and tell yourself: \u201cI deserve to sleep well and wake up rested.\u201d", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 239, "created_time": 1647255488199, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Sleep", "Self", "Evening Routine", "Insomnia", "Mental Health"]}, {"author": "Eric Sangerma", "post_id": "63173b39f3be", "user_id": "6602a04e1e00", "title": "How To Stop Feeling Miserable All The Time: A Framework That Really Works", "content": "How To Stop Feeling Miserable All The Time: A Framework that Really Works\nOptimism and pessimism are learned behaviors.\nPhoto by Jake Nackos on Unsplash\nBleak, rainy days are rare in Barcelona, but we\u2019ve been having a string of them lately.\nI hate the tiny, miserable raindrops, and I especially hate bringing mud indoors. But I won\u2019t admit to that out loud.\nI don\u2019t complain about the weather conditions. I learned a long time ago that it\u2019s not worth it.\nBack when we were still living in Bangkok, rain was a common occurrence, and I whined about it every single time.\nBut one day, I heard my words turned back on me. My kids refused to go down to the park with me because of the drizzle and the mud.\nThey grumbled about it like a pair of jaded old goats. Why should they carry an umbrella! Why put on their boots! What if they have to change their clothes later!\nI was blindsided. It wasn\u2019t that long ago that they\u2019d still liked playing in puddles.\nNow they were complaining like adults, and for no good reason. It\u2019s not like they were the ones cleaning the mud up. They didn\u2019t have the aches and pains that I occasionally get from abysmal weather.\nSo why the hell were they complaining?\nOptimism and pessimism are learned behaviors.\nOur kids serve as mirrors to our behavior as adults. And not just the parts we\u2019re proud of.\nAll my conversations at the time \u2014 with casual acquaintances, friends, family, whatever \u2014 featured me complaining about the weather.\nIt\u2019s no big deal, right? Just a bit of empty small talk to pass the time.\nBut it did affect my mood and my decisions. I\u2019d usually stay inside and work when the weather was crap, even though I knew a brisk walk would be so much healthier.\nWhen I looked out the window in the morning and it was raining, it ruined my day. Which is absurd when you consider that I have no control over the weather. (And I never will.)\nI was making myself unhappy by default, and my kids were learning it from me. I needed to change something.\nStart looking for silver linings.\nA parenting secret I like to use: it\u2019s easier to convince your kids than to convince yourself. And it worked like a charm in this case.\nI didn\u2019t tell my kids to stop complaining. I just started changing my habits.\nInstead of grumbling about the latest downpour, I\u2019d say, \u201cCool! It\u2019s finally raining, the flowers are going to get healthier. Nature needed a shower.\u201d\nI\u2019d talk about how great it was to breathe in clean air for once.\nOr I\u2019d simply grab my raincoat and head out \u2014 and grumbling or not, my kids came along.\nAs for really bad weather, we\u2019d stay in, curl up under the covers, and watch movies together. And I\u2019d say, aren\u2019t rainy days great?\nJoy will come to you eventually.\nDid I always mean it when I showed my kids how to love inclement weather? Nah, not really. But over time, it came to me as naturally as the previous grumbling.\nThen one day, it all paid off.\nComing back one day from a restaurant with my son, it started to pour like crazy. It was the rainy season in Bangkok, and downpours were impossible to predict. People around us started complaining, wincing, looking for cover.\nI looked at my son and said: \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d\nWe started to run like madmen, jumping into puddles and having a blast. It was 10 minutes of pure, unadulterated fun.\nI was a kid again, teaching my child that it was OK to have fun and get messy.\nWe got to see ourselves in the elevator mirror on our way back to our apartment. The look on my son\u2019s face was priceless.\nA simple framework to achieve \u201cglass half full\u201d thinking.\nYou can teach yourself to appreciate the little joys that come with bad weather and every other part of life.\nThe simplest way to do it? Put aside the question of what you have to do. Instead, look at what you get to enjoy.\nSome more examples I use with my kids:\nIt\u2019s not that you have to go to school; it\u2019s that you get to learn all kinds of new things.\nNo, we don\u2019t have to walk to the grocery store. But that way, we get to have a nice conversation every day.\nYou don\u2019t have to wait for 30 minutes at the doctor\u2019s office; you get to read a book or a magazine for 30 minutes.\nWe don\u2019t have to sit through a long car trip; we get to play games and see what\u2019s new en route.\nTo make this reframing work, you have to take active control of your time. Don\u2019t just let things happen to you. Take pleasure in life, and do it deliberately.\nWhy is reframing your thoughts useful?\nOptimism is good for both your health and your relationships. But it doesn\u2019t guarantee sunny skies forever.\nWhatever motivational speakers tell you, optimism alone won\u2019t bring you wealth and good luck.\nHere\u2019s what it does do for you:\n1. It gives you clarity.\nIt\u2019s easy to fall into the trap of seeing every part of life as an obligation. When that happens, you lose sight of the big picture \u2014 why are you doing things in the first place?\nFor example: You have to change your diet on your doctor\u2019s orders. But that means you get to improve your health (and try out all kinds of new recipes).\nWith an optimistic outlook, you\u2019re less likely to procrastinate. You always know why you need to do things. Or not do them. Your actions have a sense of meaning and purpose.\n2. The framework also tells you when it\u2019s time to quit something.\nIn some situations, there are no positive spins to be found. That means something\u2019s got to change.\nYou have to show up at work every day, but that means you get to\u2026\nYou have to contact that annoying friend so you get to\u2026\nYou have to get a new car because then you\u2019ll get to\u2026\nIf you can\u2019t finish these sentences? Quit your job, let that friend go, and keep your old car.\n3. It makes you a better parent/spouse/friend/family member.\nOptimistic people feel true gratitude for those around them.\nYou don\u2019t have to call your dad, you get to hear his voice.\nYou don\u2019t have to study with the kids, you get to help them learn about the world.\nYou don\u2019t have to offer your shoulder for people to cry on, you get to be there for them in their most vulnerable moments.\nIn that light, it becomes easy to prioritize your loved ones over petty bullshit that doesn\u2019t bring you real joy.\nAnd since you\u2019re reasonably content about life, you won\u2019t be one of those people who complain 24/7 about the world's unfairness. That automatically makes you easier to be around and trust.\nCan optimism make you happy?\nI don\u2019t think so. Not in itself.\nYou also need stability, good luck, and people who love you for persistent happiness. Even then, you\u2019re going to have off days.\nBut optimism can help you become less miserable over time. You can take control of your feelings, and eliminate some bad habits that are dragging you down. You can feel true, pragmatic gratitude for your life.\nAnd when you look out the window every morning, you\u2019ll see possibilities rather than just a reason to go back to bed.", "comment_count": 1, "like_count": 288, "created_time": 1649767327396, "comment": [{"user_id": "6602a04e1e00", "comment_time": 1649767327396, "comment": "Thank you for sharing!"}, {"user_id": "8c7f92ce547a", "comment_time": 1650810558098, "comment": "It always blows my mind just how empathetically your articles are structured.

But I know how it\u2019ll impact workplace productivity.\nBusinesses are shooting themselves in the foot. Burnout rates will go up again, and so will turnover.

There was a stigma attached to it, and I remember acquaintances asking confused questions: \u201cSo does that mean you work part-time? Is this a temporary thing? Is there a reason you can\u2019t work with other people?\u201d\nThat was the assumption back in the day: that remote work was a solitary affair, and you sat around all day like a hermit in a cave.\nThat was never true. Way back before any of us heard of Zoom, it was easy and rewarding to develop an online office culture.\nMy teams and I would have yearly (or quarterly) meetups, maintaining easy conversation online. I\u2019ve always liked to host monthly wellness meetings, which were never mandatory.\nPeople like to talk to each other, in my experience. They can get to know each other and develop team cohesion just fine over screens.\nBut this is crucial \u2014 this won\u2019t happen if you keep hovering over their shoulder.\nThis panic over remote work makes sense when you realize that many managers are obsessed with controlling others. And they are anxious because remote work decreases their sense of control.\nThe assumption is that everyone who works from home will slack off 24/7 unless their managers keep breathing down their necks.\nSure, some employees may do that. It\u2019s your job as team manager to know people and recognize problems in time.\nBut for most people, that doesn\u2019t sound rewarding or honorable. They\u2019ll be perfectly happy to work without constant surveillance\u2026 as long as the conditions are decent.\nShitty managers are terrified of losing control because they don\u2019t trust other people at all. They have this idea that everyone needs to be pressured to do things or they\u2019ll become stagnant.\nGet with the Times Already\nI assumed everyone had figured this out by now, but apparently not.\nRemote work increases productivity, as long as you make full use of its upsides.\nHigh-control managerial styles simply don\u2019t work over a distance. You can\u2019t easily create an atmosphere of fear. And if you do and your employees start to resent you, they will start cutting corners.\nInstead, smart managers use the flexibility offered by working from home.

There\u2019s less office politicking, less lying, and less time wasted on pointless bullshit.\nPeople have better focus when they know they\u2019re free to go pick up their kid/go take a walk/just stop and think sometimes.

Life experiences from the pre-teen and teenage years leave deep grooves on the fabric of our personal narratives. Adults tend to recall this phase of life in more detail than others. When asked to describe our experiences as adolescents, we often describe them in ways that seem at once clich\u00e9 and intimate; simple and nuanced.\nAlthough adolescence is widely recognized as an important phase of personal development, there is also a tendency to characterize adolescents in black-and-white terms. We acknowledge that increasing autonomy and intelligence are part of their development, but we still dismiss adolescents\u2019 critical thinking skills and emotional intelligence. Young people are often written off as na\u00efve, self-centered, or immature.\nIt\u2019s not wrong to acknowledge that wisdom grows with age and experience. It\u2019s appropriate to recognize that adolescents are not ready to lead fully independent lives. The mistake is underestimating what adolescents are already capable of, and the complexity of the identity development that happens in their psyches.\nThe Task of Adolescence\nThe core developmental task of adolescence is forming a sense of self. Adolescents are navigating who they want to be in the world, where they belong, developing a sense of right and wrong, and striving towards self-defined goals. They are authoring the pages of their own stories in ways they never did as younger children.\nI\u2019ll offer a bit of perspective from my experience working with adolescents in school outreach and mental health settings. I\u2019ve met adolescents who grapple with an vast range of complex cognition. Just to name a few examples, I have seen adolescents:\nThoughtfully consider existential questions like \u201cwhat does it mean to be a good person?\u201d and \u201cwhat does it mean to lead a purposeful life?\u201d\nExercise self-awareness to recognize what they can or cannot handle. I\u2019ve had multiple adolescents tell me something like \u201cMy [dad, aunt, older sibling] confides in me a lot and tells me about their problems. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate because I\u2019m only [12, 13, 14 years old]. I just don\u2019t feel ready to handle certain adult things.\u201d\nEmpathize with friends and demonstrate profound compassion for situations that are foreign to their own personal experience. Along with this empathy, I\u2019ve also seen adolescents use critical thinking to identify when they can offer peer-to-peer support for a friend in distress and when adult support is required.\nDevelop innovative plans for addressing social issues: plans that involve collaborative action with community partners and produce measurable results.\nName core parts of their identity and explore the interconnectedness of their many roles in: school, family, extracurricular activities, and local communities.\nI could go on for ages. The point is: adolescents do not spend all their time thinking about \u201ctrivial\u201d things. Not only are adolescents capable of complex thinking, but it\u2019s at the core of their development. They are regularly integrating new information and new perspectives: considering other peoples\u2019 points of view and deciding what groups they identify with. They are evaluating the norms handed down to them by their caregivers rather than accepting them unquestioningly. Because of their youth, they also need support and guidance while navigating these complexities of human existence.\nOversimplification\nThe most common way we underestimate adolescents is by oversimplifying the nature of their inner worlds. I\u2019m including some common assumptions perpetuated about adolescent thinking here.\nThey\u2019re too emotional to think rationally\nAs with many misconceptions, there\u2019s a grain of truth to this. Adolescents tend to experience a greater frequency of high-intensity emotions (both positive and distressing) than adults do.\n\u201c\u2026emotional experience across adolescence is quite dynamic, and that there is not a pattern of emotional experience that is typical for all adolescents. Instead, within- and between-person factors help clarify how and when emotional experiences vary among adolescents.\u201d\n-Understanding Emotion in Adolescents: A Review of Emotional Frequency, Intensity, Instability, and Clarity (2018)\nWe go a step too far when we assume that these emotions prevent young people from thinking rationally, though. The notion that emotionality and rationality are mutually exclusive has been thoroughly and convincingly challenged. We know that emotionality can inhibit critical thinking when it exceeds a certain threshold, but emotionality can also be part of effective decision-making.\nAdolescents are capable of learning to recognize their emotional thresholds, ride out intense waves of emotion, and self-reflect on why they experienced certain reactions. They are capable of drawing rational conclusions by evaluating multiple perspectives. Cognitive skills like perspective-taking (the ability to infer the thoughts, motivations, and emotions of others) support this kind of thinking. These skills must be learned through experience though. If we assume that adolescents are simply incapable of complex thinking, we will miss opportunities to help them exercise and build these cognitive muscles.\nThey\u2019re selfish\nAdolescence tends to be a time of self-focus, but this should not be conflated with selfishness or disregard for others. Neuroscience tells us that a disproportionate focus on personal desires is an inevitable byproduct of adolescent development. Adolescents are awakening to novel abilities like metacognition (the ability to think about how one thinks and consider multiple possibilities simultaneously) and formal operations (the ability to think beyond concrete concepts and consider hypotheticals). For the first time, they have the tools to draw self-determined conclusions about the world around them. After a lifetime of circumstances beyond their control, they have been handed a pen and the opportunity to begin self-authoring their identities. Should we blame them for spending a lot of time writing?\nIt should also be noted that self-focus and other-focus are not mutually exclusive. In the quest to establish a sense of individuality, adolescents frequently look outside themselves. A tremendous part of forming a personal identity is finding peer groups, understanding different ways of thinking, and exploring who we relate to.\nMany adolescents also demonstrate high levels of awareness about social issues and global political trends. This is especially true of Generation Z, who tend to value empathy and social consciousness more than previous generations. It is crucial that we recognize this social consciousness so that we can help adolescents navigate the complex and sometimes distressing emotions that come with sociopolitical issues.\nTheir priorities are all wrong\nAdolescents tend to spend a lot of time thinking about things like social groups, self-expression and public image. They often explore their increasing independence by challenging rules and expectations that have been placed on them as children. These tendencies can cause problems if they interfere with other aspects of life, like academic performance or following parents\u2019 rules. But they are not always the mark of immaturity or poor priorities. Navigating the aforementioned themes is part of the training that allows young people to become well-rounded adults who can find their place in society and manage their responsibilities.\nWhen we look at any example of adolescent priorities, it\u2019s easy to dismiss them as unimportant. As a 30-year-old woman, I know that the breakup a 7th grader is crying about now will seem trivial in the grand scheme of their life. Ten years from now, I know that they probably won\u2019t even think to \u201ccount\u201d this relationship when recounting their past romances. But, so what? Importance is relative. Why would an adult frame of reference be a reasonable measure for the salience of non-adult life events?\n\u201cI shall forget the drop of Anguish\nThat scalds me now \u2014 that scalds me now!\u201d\n-Emily Dickinson, from the poem \u201cI Shall Know Why\u201d\nWhen we look beneath the surface, adolescent priorities are connected to important parts of identity formation. A 12-year-old navigating her first breakup is learning how to regulate intense emotions. She is learning about what the breakup does (or doesn\u2019t) say about her value and self-worth. A 15-year-old who spends a lot of time on social media might be using a creative and cathartic outlet to express parts of his identity that are not validated elsewhere. A 16-year-old who disobeys a parent\u2019s curfew might be striving for the level of independence that will be expected of them in just two short years when they are considered a legal adult.\nEach of these priorities has a tremendously important theme at its core. When these themes go unresolved, they fester and take up even more space. They take away even more time and energy from things like homework, chores, and extracurricular obligations.\nThe Consequences of Oversimplification\nAdolescents who struggle with emotion regulation and healthy coping are often navigating intense feelings about identity formation: conflict between external expectations and internal desires, wanting to be accepted by peer groups and family, and feeling anxious about the state of social and political issues that will impact their futures.\nWhen we caricaturize adolescent identity, we risk alienating young people and leaving them to navigate the complexities of life without the guidance they so desperately need. When they know their experiences will be trivialized or dismissed, they turn inward (or to other adolescents) to deal with tremendous emotional depths. They run out of bandwidth for navigating increased academic and personal responsibility while still having significant constraints on their independence. They grapple with the need to belong while experiencing constant rejection.\nThe ache of adolescent alienation is described beautifully by one of my favorite poets:\n\u201cSo much of adolescence is an ill-defined dying, An intolerable waiting, A longing for another place and time, Another condition.\u201d -Theodore Roethke", "comment_count": 11, "like_count": 889, "created_time": 1638231715101, "comment": [{"user_id": "125b27c70cc8", "comment_time": 1638231715101, "comment": "Thank you for sharing!"}, {"user_id": "7656296dc44e", "comment_time": 1645454918994, "comment": "What enables teenagers and children to get into trouble so often is when adults keep vital information from them.

I have gotten some reactions that feel judgmental or patronizing. Very often though, people react with kindness, acceptance, and curiosity even if they don\u2019t fully understand my perspective. Most of the misconceptions I\u2019ve chosen to address in this article have come from people who are genuinely supportive and interested in changing their assumptions with new information.\nIt\u2019s important that we accept childlessness as a valid choice. I think it\u2019s equally important that we don\u2019t form oversimplified opinions about people who make this choice. To that end, I\u2019m describing a few parts of my own experience that I feel comfortable sharing. This experience will resonate strongly with some childfree people, and will be very foreign to others. That\u2019s part of the point.\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\nThis is often the first response I get after explaining that I don\u2019t want kids. When a doctor asked me this for the first time, I responded \u201cWell, the simple answer is that I know I do not want to be a parent.\u201d In a sense it really is that simple. I consider what it means to bring life into the world, the implications it would have for my identity and experiences, and I know I don\u2019t want it.\nIf I look deeper though, there is no single reason that I don\u2019t want children. There are countless variables that influence my knowledge of what I want and do not want out of life, and they are deeply interconnected. It would have been impossible to explain the full \u201cwhy\u201d to a doctor that I only knew in a limited context.\nWe don\u2019t have to know the full explanation of someone\u2019s choice to respect their ability to make the choice, but I hope to offer a small window into my \u201cwhy\u201d here.\nCommon Misconceptions\n1. \u201cOh that\u2019s okay. Some people just don\u2019t like kids.\u201d\nSome people don\u2019t relate to children or have much interest in interacting with them. And that\u2019s fine. As for me, I am the complete opposite. I have worked with kids in a lot of different roles and absolutely loved it. I am the first person to ask if I can hold someone\u2019s baby. I don\u2019t get tired of hearing my friends and family talk about their children\u2019s milestones, and I always ask for stories. Interacting with kids feels natural to me.\nIn a lot of ways it\u2019s easy to picture myself as a parent. But it\u2019s easy to picture a lot of possibilities that I\u2019m not actually interested in pursuing: like a career path that I would be well-suited for but would prevent me from having the work-life balance I need. Ultimately, my desire to be involved in children\u2019s lives is separate from any desire to raise them.\nI want to be someone that children in my life can rely on. I want to spend time with them that they will remember as they grow older. I want them to know that they have my unconditional love. But I am not willing to do what it takes to be a parent. I am not willing to do the 24/7 job of raising a person. Although it makes sense that the reward of childrearing outweighs the strain for so many people, I know it isn\u2019t the case for me.\n2. \u201cIs it because of your cancer risk?\u201d\nAs I wrote about in The Death of Obsession, I have a genetic mutation which puts me at high risk for breast cancer and others. The doctor I mentioned earlier reassured me that I could have in vitro fertilization to ensure that my embryos would not have the same mutation. She looked shocked when I replied \u201coh no, my husband and I decided not to have kids before I even had my genetic testing done. It has nothing to do with that.\u201d It seemed difficult for her to wrap her mind around the fact that I was not a woman who yearned for a child but felt paralyzed by fear of terrible health consequences: that I was not settling for a life without children. It is part of my ideal life.\nHealth is one of the many interconnected variables that influence my decision, though. My uncertainty tolerance when it comes to bringing life into the world is relatively low. I\u2019m not okay with the possibility for pregnancy complications that could range from body-altering to life threatening. I\u2019m not okay with the medical uncertainties that come with either birth or adoption. I have no interest in undergoing an expensive and invasive in vitro fertilization process. As I once explained to a family member who desperately wants me to have kids, it\u2019s a lot to ask of someone who knows they can continue living a happy and beautiful life without kids.\n3. \u201cBut you would be such a great mother!\u201d\nThis is often delivered in a sympathetic, reassuring tone. The misconception is \u201cyou don\u2019t want kids because you\u2019re afraid of being a bad parent.\u201d I know I would never be a perfect parent (nobody is), but I am confident that I would be a \u201cgood\u201d one by any reasonable measure.\nI\u2019m not trying to suppress unhealed trauma by remaining childless. In fact, my relationship to trauma from my upbringing makes me even more certain that I would be a good parent. I have reached a point in my healing where I have a healthy sense of self-awareness, empathy, and self-esteem. I know my personal growth will continue throughout my life, and I know I could be a loving and capable parent. I am not afraid of repeating the mistakes of generations before me. I just don\u2019t want to be a parent.\n4. \u201cYou must want to focus on your career.\u201d\nIt\u2019s understandable that people would make this assumption. In a society where work often consumes a tremendous proportion of our time, many people (women especially) still feel the need to decide between children or career goals. It\u2019s an unfortunate reality. But personally, being childfree is not directly related to any of my career goals. If I won the lottery and never had to work again, I don\u2019t think I would want children. If I had all the support in the world that could allow me to spend quality time with my kids without sacrificing my career, I doubt I would suddenly want children.\nIf I were to make a pie chart depicting the most important priorities in my life right now, it would be reasonably balanced. I have the space to give to others in a meaningful way, pursue my own self-defined goals, and invest in the experiences and relationships that make life meaningful to me. I actually don\u2019t want my career to take up a disproportionately large chunk of that pie chart. I love what I do, but I also value the freedom to take extended trips that allow me to spend quality time with loved ones. Parenting adds immeasurable value and meaning to many peoples\u2019 pie charts, but it does not fit into mine.\n5. \u201cWhat if you or your husband change your minds?\u201d\nWhat if one of us suddenly converts to a religion that the other does not subscribe to? What if one of us feels strongly about moving to a different state or country?\u2026 You get the point. There is only so much planning we can do for hypothetical situations. Right now, we are certain that we want to remain childless. We have only become more confident and comfortable with this choice during the 9.5 years we\u2019ve been together. We have no tangible reasons to expect our desires to change. But if the \u201cwhat if\u201d comes true, we will navigate it together like anything else.\nMy husband and I are both big-picture thinkers. The question \u201cwhat is a fulfilling life to us?\u201d is an ongoing and evolving conversation. Our goals and priorities are different than they were five years ago, and they will be different five years from now. Still, we are driven by some things that remain constant: we cherish our relationship deeply, we want to continue having new experiences together, we want to give back meaningfully to the communities we care about, we want to stay curious and keep learning new things, and we want to invest in the relationships that are fulfilling to us. These are the things that drive us, as a couple, and as individuals. I do not believe that having children is incompatible with any of these guiding principles. For us personally though, parenting does not align with the ways we want to actualize our goals.\nIt\u2019s also important to recognize that decisions about reproduction are not always binary. Some people decide to remain childless not because 0% of them wants to be a parent, but because they have weighed the possibilities and decided that childlessness is the best choice for them. I wouldn\u2019t say that I\u2019m certain I will never want children to any degree but I do know that I can live a beautiful, fulfilled life without them: a life that aligns with the guiding principles I described above. I\u2019m okay with the (small) possibility of changing my mind when it\u2019s too late to conceive. I can live with the idea that I might have some degree of regret because I know that regret would not consume me or prevent me from being happy. On the other hand, having a child now when I absolutely do not want one, would be devastating.\nI once told my therapist \u201cI never thought I would know peace, but now I\u2019m getting to know it better and better every day.\u201d I am tremendously grateful for the life and the love I have. I am at peace knowing that I have a strong sense of what a fulfilling life means to me, and a partner I share it with. And I am at absolutely at peace with the decision to remain childless.\nYou Are Not His Therapist\nDon\u2019t be a dumping ground for your boyfriend\u2019s problem.medium.com\nI wanted to do a shoutout for Chelsea Rose.

It doesn\u2019t occur to them that someone past their early-mid twenties could still be navigating what they want out of a career or changing course. I assumed the same thing when I was their age. I bought into The Script: The unofficial but widely known narrative which says there is a \u201cright fit\u201d out there for everyone and we just have to find it. The Script goes something like this:\nPhase 1: You spend your youth figuring out what you\u2019re passionate about. You strategize to complete the formula that will get you into college (GPA/honors classes+ extracurriculars + leadership experience + telling your personal story in the \u201cright way\u201d on application essays)\nPhase 2: You find a way to make your passion practical. If it can\u2019t afford you the lifestyle you want, scrap it. Pick a new passion. You decide what your major will be and map out a career path. By the time you graduate, that map should be fully fleshed out so you don\u2019t fall behind.\nPhase 3: You graduate and find an entry-level position in your field. You accrue X hours of experience in skill Y. You network with groups A, B, and C. You follow each step that will help you advance to the next role in your field. You are fulfilled by your work and you periodically get promoted. Rinse and repeat for several decades until you retire.\nThe Script vs. Reality\nPeople are recognizing that The Script neglects key variables that impact a person\u2019s decision-making and career satisfaction. The Script\u2019s main shortcoming is its rigidity. It leaves little room for changing interests, exploration, and multifaceted passions.\nNot everyone has a soulmate\nThere is a great deal of pressure for people to find the One Thing they are supposed to do. Once you find the One Thing, you are expected to sequentially advance in that field. I\u2018ve lost count of how many times I found my \u201cOne Thing.\u201d Every single time, I felt deeply passionate about what I was doing. I was using my skills in a way that felt rewarding and challenging. I was learning and growing. But there were always other things I felt passionate about: things that did not fit into my current role, or even in my current field of work. I would move on to one of those things and it would become the new One Thing. Until it wasn\u2019t.\nPeople are often expected to choose between multiple passions. There is supposed to be one passion that makes the most sense, but sometimes it doesn\u2019t work that way. In my case, it made sense to pursue my passion for Psychology and mental health. It was a fulfilling chapter of my professional life, but it was not the whole story as I had assumed it would (and should) be. I was lost when I realized I had reached the end of the chapter.\nHaving multiple passions, and changing passions, is common. Current career trends show that I am far from alone in this experience:\nIn the last year, 32% of those 25 to 44 have considered a career change.\nSince starting their first job after college, 29% of people have completely changed fields.\nInterest in a different field ranked among the top motivators for people pursuing a career change.\nDecisions over exploration\nResearcher James Marcia\u2019s framework of identity development statuses (depicted below) offers a useful way to think about career decisions. Identity achievement marks the point when someone has explored their options and made a self-determined choice about the right path. The Script tells us to view identity achievement as a singular endpoint. Once the endpoint is reached and a career decision is made, \u201cthere is no going back\u201d, as I\u2019ve heard adolescents and young adults say because they fear falling behind The Script\u2019s linear trajectory. At the same time, young adults face pressure to rush through the process of exploration and arrive at a decision. Sometimes they make decisions before they are ready. Sometimes they decide on One Thing when there is not actually One Thing that will give them the career they want.\nJames Marcia\u2019s Identity Statuses, from Socio-Emotional Development\nThe beauty of Marcia\u2019s framework though, is its fluidity. When we discuss identity statuses and career development in class, I encourage students to question the idea that identity achievement is a \u201cfinish line.\u201d We discuss the ongoing importance of exploration throughout a person\u2019s career development.\nIt is not uncommon for people to realize that they are unhappy with their chosen careers years after the decision-making point. For some, this catalyzes the kind of exploration that they missed out on while rushing into a decision that stuck to The Script. For others, it\u2019s not that they made the \u201cwrong\u201d decision in the first place. They entered a career that was the right fit for them at the time, but times have changed. They have changed. They have developed new skills and interests or their priorities have shifted.\nEven people who are satisfied with their career choices often feel unprepared for the questions that arise after identity achievement has been reached. Exploration is crucial for people whose interests do not fit neatly into one career trajectory, but it\u2019s equally important for people who have found their \u201cright fit.\u201d Most people encounter unanticipated opportunities or challenges during their career trajectories, no matter how prepared they are.\nI\u2019ll offer a couple case examples that illustrate the value of exploration at different points in a person\u2019s career journey:\nA 21-year-old recently earned his certification as a car mechanic and began working at a repair shop. He is skilled at this work and finds it rewarding. He does not need to explore multiple career options at this point, but he is engaging in exploration related to the specifics of his chosen career path. The young man is exploring future employers based on differences in their workplace cultures, opportunities for advancement, and areas of specialization he could pursue. He is considering his other priorities (i.e. a future family, social relationships) and will continue adjusting his career goals based on their relationship to these other priorities.\nAfter working as a mental health counselor for 15 years, a 40-year-old woman is burnt out and dissatisfied with her career. After years in the workforce, she has a new set of \u201cdeal-breakers\u201d and \u201cmust-haves\u201d for a workplace. She has returned to school as a non-degree seeking student to take classes in multiple disciplines and explore new interests and career possibilities. She has always been passionate about art as a hobby, but is also discovering that she enjoys her courses in business and marketing strategy. While she explores her passions, she must also account for financial considerations as she supports 2 young children and helps care for her aging parents.\nThe purpose of work\nSome people are passionate about their work. Some people work out of necessity. For many, it\u2019s a balance of both. But balance continues to feel increasingly out of reach, or downright impossible, in today\u2019s climate. The cost of a college degree in the United States is astronomical and some degrees don\u2019t pay off the way the used to. Wages in many industries have not kept up with inflation. Technology can make it difficult to separate work time from personal time. People are making too little money and working too many hours to justify the philosophy of \u201cgrind away at your unfulfilling job and it will be offset by other parts of your life.\u201d\nThe Great Resignation is showing us that people are questioning the very nature of balance. They are not only asking \u201cwhat should my balance be between practicality and passion?\u201d They are questioning the entire system. They are acknowledging how unreasonable it is to structure our entire adult lives around work as the center.\nInstead of asking \u201cwhat career will bring my life meaning?\u201d They are asking \u201cwhat gives my life meaning?\u201d and then assessing how work fits into that picture. For some people, the answer to this question includes a specific job or occupational field. For some, it includes multiple passions and interests. For others, it includes work that affords them the freedom to pursue leisure and nurture their relationships.\nAs for me, I may be a disillusioned millennial and I may not believe in soulmates, but I am still an optimist. I am tremendously grateful for the degree of balance I have found in my own career. I am pursuing multiple passions that feel fulfilling and purposeful. It has taken a lot of trial and error, and I\u2019m sure there will be plenty more, but I am finally giving myself permission to view my career as fluid and multifaceted. I want my students to have the same freedom for exploration that I have found, whether their paths are similar to my own or completely different.\nI am optimistic that society will move away from the rigid Script in favor of holistic career development and meaningful lives. Increasing evidence shows that attitudes are changing. People and companies are increasingly committed to promoting work-life balance, equitable financial and educational opportunities, and social-emotional well-being.", "comment_count": 1, "like_count": 35, "created_time": 1645497163983, "comment": [{"user_id": "125b27c70cc8", "comment_time": 1645497163983, "comment": "Thank you for sharing!"}, {"user_id": "2ba31a9d6924", "comment_time": 1646446231705, "comment": "I really enjoy your writing about the challenge of building a satisfying career Brynne, how it's not a linear thing and has multiple moving parts that change over a lifetime. \nI do believe that the core of a satisfying career is intrinsic interest in and capacity for the work.

Most every instructor can say the same. Lately, I\u2019ve been thinking back to high school creative writing classes where the aphorism \u201cShow. Don\u2019t tell.\u201d was drilled into me and asking myself am I showing my undergraduate students that I care? Am I caring in a way that is meaningful to them and helps them get the most out of my class?\nWhen I worked in mental health, I knew that the quality of a client-counselor relationship could be just as important as evidence-based therapeutic interventions. Intuitively, it seemed that the same would be true for teaching. Research supports this intuition. It\u2019s not just nice for students to know that we care about them. It\u2019s one of several important variables that can impact their GPAs, engagement, dropout rates, cognitive skills, and the subjective quality of their college experiences.\nI am detailing some practical ways I show students that I care about who they are as human beings and the value of their educational experiences. This is by no means a perfect list. I know I will continue to find new and more effective strategies. My hope is that fellow instructors will comment and share their tips, and that students will comment with their perspectives on what is beneficial to them.\n1. Provide a copy of my teaching philosophy\nWill every student read it? Definitely not. Will most of them read it? I doubt it, but some will. Regardless, I believe that students have a right to know who is teaching them and how. They deserve a class experience driven by evidence-based instruction and a teacher who can clearly articulate why they\u2019re doing what they\u2019re doing. Sometimes the transparency itself is enough to make a difference and let students know they are respected.\n2. Seek actionable feedback\nSeeking feedback during a course can demonstrate that instruction is not a one-way street. I\u2019m not here to simply disseminate information. I\u2019m here to give information based on my expertise and facilitate useful engagement with course material. Student perspectives are not only helpful but necessary in allowing me to do this. Acting on their feedback (or giving a respectful explanation for why I can\u2019t act on certain feedback) is a way of demonstrably \u201cshowing\u201d rather than just \u201ctelling\u201d students that I care about their needs and their learning experiences.\nI normally use electronic feedback surveys that students complete during class. I\u2019ve received invaluable input from these surveys: input that has changed the structure of my lectures for the better. Input that has allowed me to help students feel more comfortable engaging during class when they might otherwise have disengaged. Input that was crucial for making my content inclusive and accessible. Input I may never have received (or only received on end-of-semester course evaluations when it was too late to make changes for those particular students) if I hadn\u2019t asked.\n*At the end of this article, I have included examples of survey questions that I use. I have found a brief format with both closed-ended and open-ended questions to be most useful.\n3. Invite varied forms of participation\nIt\u2019s a challenge, and a wonderful opportunity, to structure courses that engage students with varied personalities, needs, and interests. As someone who has always been comfortable with public speaking, I\u2019ve had to ask myself how I can engage students who are less comfortable speaking up in class. It helps to assess the curriculum for class sessions and plan for varied participation activities that are appropriate to each week\u2019s content. Throughout the semester I include a combination of three main forms of engagement: full class discussion, independent written reflections, and small group discussions. Within each individual class session, I try to incorporate at least two of the three.\nReviewing the forms of participation that are possible in a virtual format has also helped increase engagement in online courses. Many students have expressed they prefer the \u201craise hand\u201d feature as opposed to physically raising their hands or speaking up without being called upon. Some students also prefer to type their thoughts into the \u201cchat\u201d feature once they\u2019ve had time to think about what they\u2019d like to say.\n4. Always grant the first request for an extension\nThere are exceptions to every rule, but I typically grant a student\u2019s first request for an extension. I grant most extension requests in general. If a troubling pattern emerges and a student is falling behind or failing to communicate effectively about requests for flexibility, of course, I address that. But I think it\u2019s important to honor the fact that my students\u2019 lives do not revolve around my class.\nWhether a student is recovering from a health condition, taking care of a family matter, or simply got overwhelmed with assignments during a particular week, I would rather have them turn in quality work than rush an assignment for my class. I would rather reinforce that speaking up for their needs (both personal and academic) is a positive thing than promoting rigidity for its own sake. I would rather have students feel comfortable approaching me than have them be afraid to ask for flexibility that might promote their self-care and support the quality of their academic work.\n5. Promote self-directed learning\nStudent-led learning demonstrates that my perspective as the instructor is not the only important one or the most important one. My perspective is crucial because of my expertise in the subject matter, but their perspectives as learners breathe life into the material.\nIn most class sessions, I incorporate at least one opportunity for students to engage in collaborative student-led learning. It\u2019s important that they be given space to share their perspectives among classmates without being micromanaged. I have said this in other articles, and I\u2019ll keep repeating it: one of the biggest favors I have done my students is knowing when to get out of their way!\nI\u2019ve noticed that students truly appreciate when I prioritize their unique interests related to the course material. In addition to some assigned readings, I regularly let students choose from a collection of readings covering a variety of subjects relevant to our course. I also provide multiple choices for essay prompts and options for variable assignment formats.\n6. Provide positive feedback no matter what\nThis is just as important, if not more important, when a student doesn\u2019t perform as well as they hoped on an assignment. I am clear about referencing the rubric and identifying what was lacking in a student\u2019s work so that they have the opportunity to improve, but I also provide specific and detailed positive comments. The word \u201cspecific\u201d is key here. We know that specific feedback is important for facilitating meaningful learning. It\u2019s also important for demonstrating that an instructor cares enough to recognize and remember a student\u2019s unique strengths. Students are more likely to value a class where the instructor values them.\nI often include positive feedback in response to student communications apologizing for late work, poor attendance, etc. as well. I typically start my responses by thanking the student for being proactive and reaching out, particularly if they have made contact when there is still sufficient time to change course. In addition to acknowledging the consequences for missed assignments and options for moving forward, providing positive feedback demonstrates that I believe in the student\u2019s ability to succeed and that I want them to succeed. The fear that an instructor views someone as a \u201cbad student\u201d can inhibit academic growth and cause unnecessary stress.\nOf course, there will always be students who don\u2019t get the most out of a course. Will I be bummed if this happens? Sure. Will I bend over backward to give a student points they haven\u2019t earned? No. But I won\u2019t characterize them as \u201cbad\u201d students. And ultimately I want them to know that I recognize they are complex, worthy human beings regardless of their performance in my class.\n7. Be myself\nCorny as it may be, authenticity goes a long way. I have found that students feel more comfortable asking questions and stay more engaged during class when I\u2019m not trying so hard to conduct myself in a \u201cprofessional\u201d manner that I come across as impersonal.\nI don\u2019t need to be somebody that my students would want to befriend or be like. I just need them to see my authentic personality and my passion for the subject matter. So sometimes I say things in a way that makes me cringe a little. I second guess myself because I could\u2019ve framed something with a more \u201csophisticated\u201d analogy. I spend a few more minutes than intended hearing about students\u2019 weekend plans and asking cheesy icebreaker questions at the beginning of class and getting to know them better. Ultimately, I prioritize communicating in a language that feels natural to me and accessible to all students.\nAuthor\u2019s image below is an excerpt from a student feedback survey (distributed during the first third of a semester-long course):\nAuthor\u2019s image\nSubscribe to Insights from Educate for a biweekly dose of professional learning and inspiration from authentic voices in education.\n", "comment_count": 1, "like_count": 122, "created_time": 1642638297583, "comment": [{"user_id": "125b27c70cc8", "comment_time": 1642638297583, "comment": "Thank you for sharing!"}, {"user_id": "2ba31a9d6924", "comment_time": 1645478687366, "comment": "Excellent piece Brynne! \ud83d\udc4f Can stand alone as a primer on student engagement!\nI think authenticity and passion for the subject are the rocket fuel for student engagement.

Photo by Max Fischer from Pexels\nThe other day on Instagram, I got a little shocked because I realized I needed a bespoke serum for my skin. You wouldn\u2019t believe the extent to which it had changed all these influencers\u2019 lives! They felt beautiful, happy, and regretted all those years they had lived without the serum. So I took the linked skin quiz to receive an analysis kit and have an algorithm do its thing with my skin\u2019s oil, moisture, and pH levels. I needed customized beauty treatment asap. I mean, what am I, some hopeless hag doomed to walk the earth with mediocre drugstore skin, unworthy of the age-defying miracles a bespoke serum could bring?\nAlas, the urgent need went poof once I had scrolled further and was hit with an endless stream of solutions to other problems I didn\u2019t know I had: shampoo specifically for make-up brushes, a mug that keeps the perfect coffee temperature and talks to my phone about it, a device fixing flat ponytails, tape with the power to hold over two pounds of decoration on my wall, and more. With just one click, I\u2019d never have to deal with any of these headaches I never knew I had ever again! I\u2019d just have to figure out my perfect coffee temperature, let my phone know, and I\u2019d be on the path to being right as rain.\nRecently, I was considering buying a dog towel. It dries your dog. There are also yoga towels, you know, for yoga. There are hand towels, bath towels, hair towels, and decorative finger towels that are good for nothing but draping over hand towels. Foot towels, kitchen towels, tea towels, dish towels, travel towels, beach towels, baby mouth towels, and towels with happy dolphins frolicking in formation. Pottery Barn offers instructions about how to build a towel wardrobe. They suggest two to three sets of towels for all occasions for each person in the household. And they have solutions for storing these occupants of real estate in pretty ways.\nWhat do we need? What do we want? And who decides?\nGerman philosopher Immanuel Kant had the issue down in the 18th Century. He argued that a state with the desire to control doesn\u2019t want citizens who think for themselves. It wants to keep people immature and busy with the mundane to distract them from the fact that they are powerless in the important decisions that affect their lives. Dazzling grown-ups with the pleasure of consumption is a highly effective way to infantilize them and seduce them to preserve the system over which they have no say. Look at us, happily hunting more and more stuff, all the while voluntarily helping to be kept under control by handing over millions of pieces of personal information and allowing ourselves to be tracked. We even invite little devices into our homes, talk to them and have them listen. I grew up in East Berlin under the repression of the infamous secret service Stasi \u2014 they would have given their eyes and teeth for that kind of access. And most of us even know it\u2019s probably not that good of an idea to accept this kind of surveillance. But we do. What\u2019s the alternative? Not enjoy the convenience? Not play with all the toys?\nKant saw us as lazy and scared nonagers, only too happy to retreat to play-time. He called for human beings to exit their self-incurred immaturity, but that\u2019s easier said than done when you\u2019re busy trying to figure out which car will give your personality the right twist. Or which of these high-tech compression and thermoregulation leggings form the best butts. Every 13 seconds, a child dies from hunger, while every year the United States wastes $161 billion worth of food and \u2026 Oh, but look! The winner for best vacuum cleaner 2021 in the cordless category is out. And it\u2019s on sale! Wait, what were we talking about?\nRight, how our culture keeps us busy with ridiculous decisions about things we don\u2019t want or need.\nWhere I grew up, in East Germany, behind the wall, there was not much stuff to want. As a seductress, our market sucked. Initially, the revolution in the 80ies had not been about wanting capitalism but about a better socialism that might actually work. However, once the wall was down and the West German government had given every East German some welcome money, no one could be bothered anymore with creating a society with the best of both worlds. It was time to shop. We must have appeared voracious, the way we cleared out the shelves. Nothing else seemed to matter but things. Yours truly, at ten years old, developed an obsession with \u201cThe Price Is Right\u201d on TV. All those shiny things, the colors, the jingles \u2014 what a wonderful new universe! I was a kid whose whole world as she knew it had just crumbled, I had no idea where I was anymore and if I was going to be alright. But no one could beat me at guessing the price of a 10-piece blender set.\nBeing is free. But we prefer having.\nLooking back at how the events unfolded, I can\u2019t help but feel sad for my people. They had fought so hard for freedom only to immediately fall into the cage of jeans, Marlboro, and video recorders. Being is free. But we prefer having, thinking it will make being more pleasurable. In \u201cThe Art of Loving\u201d, psychologist and philosopher Erich Fromm writes about our insatiable appetite for consuming everything the world has to offer. \u201cThe world is one great object for our appetite, a big apple, a big bottle, a big breast,\u201d writes Fromm. \u201cWe are the sucklers, the eternally expectant ones, the hopeful ones \u2014 and the eternally disappointed ones.\u201d Because what we\u2019re really after is love. But we\u2019re trapped on the hedonic treadmill, setting and resetting our consumption goals to stimulate our pleasure centers, always craving another hit. We\u2019re running towards the mirage of satisfaction, but we\u2019ll never arrive.\nWe can\u2019t call it freedom if we have lost control over what we truly want and need. One freedom we do have, says Kant, is to keep our immediate desires in check. And only when we make use of this freedom can we be self-determined.

Photo by Brett Sayles from Pexels\nThis past fall, a 96-year-old woman in Germany went on the run. She took a cab in the early morning hours from her nursing home and fled to the city of Hamburg to escape the trial of her complicity in murdering more than 11.000 people. In her youth, she had worked as a secretary for a Nazi commandant in the concentration camp Stutthof. All correspondence regarding this hellish place of hunger, disease, and death crossed her desk. After the war, she claimed she didn\u2019t know anything about the murder machine she had helped run.\nSeven decades later, Irmgard Furchner wasn\u2019t able to elude justice once again. Police captured her and brought her to court, where she remained in custody.\nThe past is inescapable.\nLooking back at history can bring up a clump of uncomfortable feelings. I get it, America. Still, I\u2019m bewildered by your reluctance to have an honest historical reckoning. Not least of all because I\u2019m German.\nOr was. I\u2019m an American now \u2014 one who\u2019s struggling to wrap her mind around this \u201cCan we move on already?!\u201d approach to history. I\u2019ve always known that the US deals with its past quite differently from Germany. But witnessing the recent attempts at banning fact-based history education from schools opened my eyes to the full scope of refusal \u2014 or, in the best-case scenario, fear \u2014 to take responsibility for the entirety of parts that is the USA.\nParents are fighting tooth and nail to prevent their kids from learning about the dark areas of their country\u2019s past. The promise of forcing schools to keep silent on the lingering impact of slavery and racism wins elections. More than half of all US states have introduced bills that limit how teachers can discuss race \u2014 it\u2019s now written in US laws that history should not be taught if it might cause students to feel uncomfortable, guilty, or distressed on account of their race. Under these circumstances, a historical event like the 1921 Tulsa race massacre would hardly have a chance to make it into the classroom, given that it involves white people burning down much of the wealthy Black neighborhood of Greenwood, leaving hundreds of Black people dead, ten thousand homeless, and none of the survivors ever compensated for their losses. No arrests from the mob were made, and immediate effort was taken to erase the massacre from collective memory. Lots of potential for emotional unease.\nAssuming that the reason for selectively concealing history is, in fact, authentic concern for the emotional wellbeing of young people, or more specifically, young white people: Would it really make them feel bad hearing the unadorned truth about an evil their ancestors had committed? Likely. But as a German, I know that working through these feelings will be absolutely worth it for themselves as well as for the country.\nThe uncomfortable and challenging German history lessons erased the emotional distance to the past, shaping me, shaping the future. I\u2019m the link.\nI grew up learning over and over about the crimes my grandparents\u2019 generation had committed. I studied all the cruelties, watched the documentaries, visited the camps, listened to their survivors. For me, the piles of teeth did it. The piles of teeth the Nazis carefully collected from their victims in the camps. Or the barrels of hair, or stacks of bones. These horrific images I was shown as part of my education about the truth taught me to feel history. Feel it as a personal matter. Six million Jews killed is an abstract fact hard to connect to. But the pictures brought humanity to the number. They erased the emotional distance to the past, shaping me, shaping the future. I\u2019m the link.\nNot only in History class but also in Literature, Arts, and Social Studies did we learn in detail what our grandparents and great-grandparents unleashed on the world. The German school curriculum provides many ways to help students look the ugly past in the eye. And so I experienced all that opponents of an honest reckoning with US history fear. Yes, I felt uncomfortable about being German. I felt shame and still do. I don\u2019t want this to be part of my story. I don\u2019t want to be related to people that let this happen. I hate the connections people make when I say I\u2019m German. My historical education certainly challenged me emotionally and made me grapple with my identity and perspective on the world.\nThat\u2019s what learning and growing are all about.\nWhat it did not result in, concerned parents and politicians will be relieved to know, is making me think that Germany is per se an immoral and racist country and that I should feel apologetic for being German. It did not make me feel personally guilty for the Nazi crimes, nor did I conclude that I\u2019m evil by heritage. It did not program me to hate myself, my family, or my country.\nIt did, however, make me unequivocally aware of my personal duty to help prevent history from ever repeating itself. I learned that while I\u2019m not responsible for the past, I\u2019m responsible for the future. Those classes equipped me for the battle. Having studied what led to the crimes and what kept them ongoing, I\u2019m alert to relative dynamics in today\u2019s society. I learned to recognize racist and authoritarian views and prevent them from gaining traction. I also feel a strong connection to my fellow Germans through this shared collective responsibility. It gives me a sense of national pride \u2014 not just as a prescribed patriotic duty but a pride I legitimately earned and matured into by working through the shame that comes with certain truths.\nMost importantly, I learned empathy. It\u2019s what you\u2019re missing when you fight to keep your Confederate Statues without realizing that they represent the undesirability of your neighbors who have to walk past them day after day, too.\nFrom my immigrant perspective, the United States is all about the promise of a new day. This is where the dreamers come to live their dreams for other dreamers to dream about. From the beginnings of this country on, a constant stream of new immigrants has been bringing in new ideas for the future. Many come, if not to forget an old-world, then at least to find a better one. This country is driven by people looking forward. America is all about progress and the promise of better times.\nThat\u2019s the dream, at least. A dream famous the world over. And what is America if not the dream? It makes sense not to taint an identity wrapped in an uplifting future with a disturbing past.\n\u201cThose parts of our history that do not straighten our backs are either ignored or distorted to the point that they would be unrecognizable to the people who lived through them.\u201d \u2014 Mychal Denzel Smith, author\n\u201cAs Americans we are eager, ravenous even, to believe the most flattering narratives about ourselves,\u201d writes author Mychal Denzel Smith in his book Stakes is High. Life After the American Dream. \u201cThey don\u2019t have to be true; the hand-wringing over the age of \u2018alternative facts\u2019 rings hollow when the history we teach is built on them.\u201d Americans like stories that make them feel good about themselves, Smith writes. \u201cThose parts of our history that do not straighten our backs are either ignored or distorted to the point that they would be unrecognizable to the people who lived through them.\u201d\nNot that it\u2019s unhealthy to focus on the good. As I\u2019m often trapped in my anxious and pessimistic German thinking, I do adore the American optimism and the lust for moving forward. However, running from a former self with your eyes closed, you\u2019ll have the past in hot pursuit, nipping at your backside, sidetracking you from ever getting anywhere. Worse still, a culture that shuts out parts of its identity is in danger of disintegrating into a mere myth. \u201cOur faults are not American, only the progress,\u201d writes Smith, \u201cending slavery is American, the institution itself was not. Extending the vote to white women via constitutional amendment is American, denying them the vote for more than a century of the nation\u2019s existence was not.\u201d\nLo and behold, there\u2019s the light: Smith\u2019s observations also show that righting wrongs is actually on code with American culture. But the job of ending slavery has been left unfinished, as the country\u2019s racist history keeps informing the present. Acknowledging the horrors of history and recognizing the legacy slavery has left is the next step to straighten the American back to full strength.\nGuiding students through a confrontation with the facts of history will not leave them feeling like being white makes them part of a problem. But of a solution.\nUnderstandably, some parents might feel anxious at the thought of having their kids hear stories that might make them feel bad about being white Americans. But kids are not stupid. They already know they live in a world of racial tensions. They can feel it, like everyone. And they might not understand what\u2019s causing the conflicts, just like many adults don\u2019t. Most people have an abstract concept of racism in their head which they feel does not apply to them. As no abstract concept ever does. If you\u2019ve never learned the impact slavery had on the building blocks of our society, laws, and institutions, you might not be sensitive to words, actions, and behaviors that arise from racist ideas. The next generation deserves better. Guiding them through a confrontation with the facts of history will not leave them feeling like being white makes them part of a problem. But of a solution.\nThe historical reckoning in Germany is faulty and incomplete. Following the worldwide trend, the country struggles with a right-wing movement threatening democracy. And surveys show that a lot of Germans wish to stop it already with the debates about Nazis past. And yet, there\u2019s still a line and a common sense of norms. Not even at the very margins of the far right corner would anyone claim that World War II was about some noble cause other than racism, Aryan supremacy, and getting rid of Jews. Because it wasn\u2019t. You won\u2019t find any monuments honoring German World War II soldiers. Germany chose to unequivocally agree on the values it stands for today. When one of the most famous members of the right-wing populist party AfD, said that the Holocaust monument in Berlin was a monument of shame and that Germans should take a more positive attitude towards their Nazi past, the party denounced his remarks and referred to him as a burden. You can\u2019t win elections that far from the norm.\nThe German reckoning also started much too late. For decades after the war, Nazis held their old positions, and the vast majority of the population saw themselves as victims of the war. It wasn\u2019t until the 60s that the next generation confronted them, refusing to respect the authority of parents, teachers, or professors involved in the Nazi crimes, however passively. Only in the 80s did substantial research slowly begin, and did politicians follow.\n\u201cLearning that it took decades of hard work before those who committed what are arguably the greatest crimes in history could acknowledge those crimes and begin to atone for them, brings enormous relief to those working toward similar acknowledgment in the United States.\u201d \u2014 Susan Neiman, philosopher\nIt\u2019s precisely these failures that should bring hope to other nations reckoning with their respective pasts, as the philosopher Susan Neiman argues in her book Learning From the Germans. Race and the Memory of Evil. \u201cLearning that it took decades of hard work before those who committed what are arguably the greatest crimes in history could acknowledge those crimes and begin to atone for them, brings enormous relief to those working toward similar acknowledgment in the United States,\u201d writes Neiman. \u201cIf even those raised in the heart of darkness needed time and trouble to see the light, why shouldn\u2019t it take time and trouble to bring Americans \u2014 nurtured for years on messages of their own exceptional goodness \u2014 to come to terms with homegrown crimes?\u201d\nAfter all, they\u2019re on it. Cities and communities across the United States have begun to grapple with their history. New Orleans has removed several statues and monuments that paid tribute to a history of white supremacy. In Richmond, Virginia, the former capital of the confederacy, the statue of Robert E. Lee was hoisted up from its pedestal and taken down for good after having loomed as a physical testament to white power for more than 130 years. The mayor of Tulsa has reopened the investigation of the massacre. Joe Biden was the first president in 100 years to visit the grounds where he promised to stop burying the pain. \u201cWe can\u2019t just choose to learn what we want to know and not what we should know,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should know the good, the bad, the everything. That\u2019s what great nations do.\u201d\nWith truth comes healing.\nHad it been left to the Germans, they most likely wouldn\u2019t have chosen to uncover the layers of their shame. It was actually the Americans who helped Germany to grow by forcing it to reckon. Even American TV had a major impact: The miniseries Holocaust from 1978 was a turning point in the way the Germans thought about their history. It set off the willingness of a mass audience to grapple with the past. With their efforts to take full responsibility, the Germans gained strength and earned the trust of other countries who have allowed this former monster of a nation a comeback as a leading and respected partner. With truth comes healing, on all sides.

Photo by Monstera from Pexels\nWould you admit at a dinner party how envious you are of your friend as everything he touches turns to gold while you trudge through life a mere mortal? Probably not. Nobody wants to be the envious one in the room. Or the egoistic, frustrated, angry one, or, god forbid, commit the greatest sin of our upbeat culture: think negatively.\nWe\u2019re obsessed with positive feelings, positive attitudes, and positive thinking. Somehow, we have come to believe that we should never stray too far from the sunny side of our personality. Negativity means someone is in need of treatment. Smile, for good life\u2019s sake, smile!\nSpecifically, positive thinking has turned into somewhat of a decree. Not only is it frowned upon when we doubt ourselves, voice concern, or dwell on obstacles but do you, too, feel an inner judgment when your mind dares to bring up pessimistic demur? Because you feel like your failure to think positively will make your life go to the dogs? This is the other side of the common belief that we just have to focus on positive thoughts and believe firmly in our ability to achieve our dreams to make them happen, most famously described in the Law of Attraction. Admittedly, it\u2019s a tempting idea and comforting promise that I have the power to bring on any positive result I wish by thinking positive thoughts. There\u2019s a problem, though: If I believe it\u2019s all in my hands, then all the hard blows I\u2019m experiencing are also on me. I\u2019m then adding guilt and shame to every \u201cself-inflicted\u201d adverse event in my life.\n\u201cMerely dreaming about the future makes people less likely to realize their dreams and wishes.\u201d \u2014 Gabriele Oettingen, author and professor of psychology\nAnother problem: Science says positive thinking alone doesn\u2019t get you anywhere. Action does. \u201cThe solution isn\u2019t to do away with dreaming and positive thinking,\u201d says Gabrielle Oettingen, who has been researching for decades about the problematic consequences of one-track positive thinking. \u201cRather, it\u2019s making the most of our fantasies by brushing them up against the very thing most of us are taught to ignore or diminish: the obstacles that stand in our way.\u201d In her book Rethinking Positive Thinking. Inside the New Science of Motivation, she presents ample evidence for the motivational benefits of facing reality in all its positive and negative glory and paying particular attention to the problems that are holding us back. \u201cMy research has concluded that merely dreaming about the future makes people less likely to realize their dreams and wishes,\u201d writes Oettingen. \u201cThe pleasurable act of dreaming seems to let us fulfill our wishes in our minds, sapping our energy to perform the hard work of meeting the challenges in real life.\u201d\nOettingen introduces an approach to get you out of that trap: mental contrasting. It allows you to anticipate the obstacles you\u2019ll most likely encounter on your way to your dream future so that you can start working on removing them before the situation overwhelms you. You might be asking yourself, \u201cDon\u2019t we run the risk of talking ourselves out of our dreams by preemptively focusing on possible hurdles along the way?\u201d Good for you; you already started your practice of allowing some negative thoughts. But no need to worry about this, as studies, show that mental contrasting grounds our fantasies in reality and motivates us to take action to pursue our goals. It\u2019s precisely the envisioning of obstacles that energizes us to take them on.\nSo let\u2019s get to it; time to WOOP now. Wish, Outcome, Obstacle, Plan \u2014 that\u2019s the four-step mental strategy Oettingen has developed to help you apply mental contrasting.\nGet your dream ready, and let\u2019s WOOP it to life:\nWish\nWhat are you dreaming of? Do you wish to achieve a particular goal or solve a problem? It can be a big ambition that could take some time to realize, like writing a book, working your way to a promotion, or learning Mandarin. Or it might be a minor task you\u2019re looking to accomplish, like sending an uncomfortable text or eating no more than ten cookies. While dreaming big is always to be encouraged, make sure your wish is feasible. I, for one, want to marry Owen Wilson, but I might die WOOPing about it.\nOutcome\nThis is the time to imagine the outcome of your wish in all its beauty. Don\u2019t hold back, paint with all your crayons. How would life be if you\u2019d finally found the courage to have an honest conversation with your roommate about the late-night fish cooking? How could your future look if you dared to ask this fabulous person out and they said yes? How would it feel to have slain the presentation at work amazing everyone with your ideas which will all be implemented, leading the company to great success, a success that will echo throughout the office for decades to come? Really live through the result of your wish coming true, venture further and further into your desired future. This mental experience of your dream will provide direction for your actions.\nObstacle\nNow hit the ground of reality. Time for some straight talk with one crucial question: What\u2019s keeping you from going where you want to go? What\u2019s the hold-up? Often we don\u2019t really have a clear picture of the barriers that are holding us back. \u201cFind the most critical, internal obstacle that prevents you from fulfilling your wish or solving your concern,\u201d writes Oettingen. \u201cWhen thinking about obstacles, people often look to the external world, naming circumstances or individuals they feel are blocking them. But by choosing a wish that we think is feasible, we\u2019re already accounting for obstacles outside us (if serious obstacles outside us existed, the wish wouldn\u2019t be feasible).\u201d Think about how your behaviors, habits, emotions, or assumptions might stand in your way: Is your idleness to blame? Or your fear of turmoil or change? Try to be as specific as you can: Are you too tired in the evenings to work on your cat training business model? Is your inner rebel who wants to sit and watch one more and then another episode of anything preventing you from writing your thesis? Do all the other, seemingly more pressing things on your to-do list keep you from hitting the gym? If you have a clear vision of your obstacle, you will have a shot at clearing it out of the way.\nPlan\nThe last step is creating a plan for what exactly to do once your obstacle shows up. And you know it will. Say, your hurdle for not turning your brilliant story idea into a screenplay is that you don\u2019t have time to do it. Because you have so many other things to do. Because there\u2019s always someone distracting you. Because whenever you sit down, your mind turns into broccoli. Because life is so extra all the time that you can\u2019t have two consecutive thoughts. Or could it actually be that your fear of failing at your genius idea with a mediocre execution is just so big that you\u2019d rather blame life and time? Yeah, thought that was the one. So what are you going to do when this fear shows up? How exactly will you react when it tries to convince you that you should avoid working on your script at all costs? Formulate a specific plan: \u201cIf that fear shows up, I\u2019m going to remind myself that I\u2019ve already accomplished many things in life as I was simultaneously freaking the hell out. I\u2019m going to remember that fear visits regularly during my day job too but not delivering there isn\u2019t an option as I enjoy things like shelter and eating. I am, actually, a pretty reliable worker despite all my inner doubts.\u201d So this is the action you\u2019re going to take once your obstacle shows up. With this plan in mind, you won\u2019t get overwhelmed, you will allow your fear to yap for a second, hug it, have it sit next to you, and let it freak the hell out about all your brilliant writing. Maybe ask it to keep it down a bit.\nNone of this is to say you should become a grumpy downer. A positive outlook is a helpful tool to improve your life \u2014 both optimism and positive thinking are linked to better mental and physical health. But leaving the path of positivity when the time is right allows you to pursue realistic goals in a thoughtful, determined way.", "comment_count": 11, "like_count": 1225, "created_time": 1635539782668, "comment": [{"user_id": "d976b7524dd1", "comment_time": 1635539782668, "comment": "Thank you for sharing!"}, {"user_id": "5e31c56d6ea3", "comment_time": 1635634541130, "comment": "You make very good points.

Photo by cottonbro from Pexels\nWe do it for a green light, a pregnancy, a good idea or a promotion, for something bad to happen, someone to stop talking, or someone fabulous to text back: waiting. And, boy, do we hate it.\nWaiting feels like time that belongs in the trash. It\u2019s not good for anything else but holding up mirrors to see the fools who believe they have control over their lives. Instead of living our best self-determined life, we\u2019re at the mercy of some event that\u2019s still playing hard to get. And who knows when and even if it\u2019ll happen or if we\u2019ll still want it once it\u2019s here. And will it turn out the way we want or as just some bunk outcome that wasn\u2019t worth the wait?\nIn waiting, we feel like we\u2019re being robbed of the possibilities of our present because time seems to be passing in relation to some point in the future. There\u2019s no direction in this kind of now; it\u2019s an in-between state with many unknowns and not much to hold on to. Nothing is happening, we\u2019re just frittering life away. It can make us feel anything on the spectrum from uncomfortable to berserk.\nDid you know that people would rather give themselves an electric shock than sit around for a few minutes with nothing to do?\nBut before you stick a fork in the toaster, bear with me for a bit until we come to the inevitable understanding of how awesome it is to not get what we want right away. To wait for it.\nHere are 5 reasons to start loving the involuntary pause:\n1. Embrace every opportunity forcing you to practice patience\nWho did this to us? Who robbed us of our ability to be patient, turning us into screaming babies as soon as we don\u2019t get the cookie, now? Living in the times of digital straightaway-ism, we\u2019ve gotten used to every wish immediately fulfilled. Insta insta insta! Delivery tomorrow? Well, that\u2019s just bad service. My fellow impationaries, let\u2019s revolt! Let\u2019s want it later, let\u2019s de-Prime our lives, let\u2019s say hooray delay! And this is why: Studies found that patient people experience less depression and are better able to cope with difficult situations. They feel better connected to the people around them, are more hopeful and satisfied with their lives. Patience also helps you achieve your goals because you\u2019re better able to see the big picture instead of being discouraged by a lack of immediate results. Cherish every moment that life refuses to fulfill your desires as a golden opportunity to practice patience \u2014 for example, by reflecting on our tendency to expect the environment, people, or even our minds to conform to our expectations. A bit much to ask, isn\u2019t it?\n2. Find pleasure in waiting for it\nI grew up in East Berlin behind the wall \u2014 a place where you never got what you wanted, let alone immediately. The average waiting time for our miraculously crappy Trabant car was ten to 15 years. Many East Germans are still waiting as the fall of the wall in 1989 was also the Trabant\u2019s demise. Growing up in an economy not designed to fulfill your every need, I know the joys of anticipation. See, as a kid, I was crazy for cornflakes. Because, usually, I had none. Only once in a blue moon, you\u2019d enter the supermarket and spot them in someone\u2019s cart. Then you\u2019d start to run, and if this was your lucky day, you\u2019d get your hands on a bag of them. On these days, in the cornflakes aisle, I found true happiness. Now, with the daily platoons of available boxes standing at attention? Now cornflakes are meh. What\u2019s so brilliant about toasted maize anyway? What\u2019s so great about anything? Wanting something nowadays means that it\u2019s probably already there. And we\u2019re missing out because anticipation amps up the value of what you\u2019re getting. That\u2019s true for the whole scope of things to want \u2014 from cornflakes to a loved one you were given the gift of missing. Appreciation feels fantastic. And this feeling has legs, too: A psychological study has shown that waiting for things makes us happy in the long run. So go and make a \u201cDon\u2019t do\u201d list and jot down everything you want to wait for.\n3. Become the master of your time by letting go of mastering your time\nIs there anyone out there who isn\u2019t aware that meditation and mindfulness is the key to making pretty much everything better? I challenge you to browse ten self-help articles and find one without reference to the benefits of mindfulness. Most of us know how important it is to regularly have some quality alone time with the moment. Far fewer people feel like actually sitting down to meditate. But you don\u2019t have to necessarily restrict your practice of attention and awareness to the typical meditation set-up: What if not waiting, where time famously passes much slower, offers an excellent opportunity to observe what is happening and savor the moment? Don\u2019t try to escape this precious time by grabbing your phone to check something, like something, send something, or do other useless stuff for the sake of feeling useful. Instead, wait. Wait for what\u2019s next and enjoy the feeling of not being the master but a mere observer of your time.\nAdvanced waiters can proceed to consciously seek out waiting time. Wait until you hear a honk, until your phone makes a sound, until you\u2019ve seen five people with funny walks, or something getting carried away by the wind. Games like these help us to become more conscious of the value of time. You\u2019ll actually gain time because you\u2019re training yourself to become aware sooner whenever you\u2019re trapped in time-gobbling nonsense activity. I\u2019m looking at you, there in bed, checking TikTok for hours. (I\u2019m looking at me.)\n4. Let boredom bring out the best in you\nFace it, in the transition from birth to death, all life is waiting. It might be precisely that which can make actual waiting times so unbearable: When life gets a bit tedious, we\u2019re reminded of the end. But that\u2019s okay, no need to dread or eliminate boredom. It won\u2019t kill you. In fact, it can give birth to the fantastic gifts inside of you to make life better for all of us. Doing nothing boosts productivity and creativity \u2014 if you\u2019re bored, your brain uses the time to connect dots and sort thoughts, which can lead to brilliant ideas and solutions for problems.\n5. Outline your new story\nCertain events bring about new chapters in our lives. But often, our new story doesn\u2019t begin right away. Sometimes it all starts out with a hunch that change might be necessary. And from there, it can take forever to figure out where to actually go. Other times, something happens that abruptly puts an end to the world as you know it \u2014 as the pandemic did. We were thrown into a new situation, and we had no idea what to expect and how our lives would turn out. These in-between times can be extremely nerve-wracking but also extremely precious. Suppose life doesn\u2019t serve you your new situation or your new identity immediately, and everything is upside down. Taking action wouldn\u2019t make any sense yet. In that case, you get to use the transition period for freely exploring your options. In times of insecurity, we look for orientation, which opens up our minds to novel ways. Dream about new directions for your life, envision what you desire, play with different scenarios. Use the space you were given to start preparing new beginnings.\nImagine how life would feel if you\u2019d never had to simmer a season\u2019s finale; if you\u2019d never had a chance to smell the cake getting ready for you in the oven; if you swipe right on someone who\u2019d immediately sit on your couch talking about Bitcoin; if Spring would already be there, always; if someone you love got pregnant and the baby would already be screaming in your arms; if you could call it a day before it had even started. Would we feel life at all without unfulfilled desire, needful imagination, and the eternal pursuit of happiness?", "comment_count": 11, "like_count": 1456, "created_time": 1635197215665, "comment": [{"user_id": "d976b7524dd1", "comment_time": 1635197215665, "comment": "Thank you for sharing!"}, {"user_id": "ec2c78950ce", "comment_time": 1635802996793, "comment": "Hear, hear!"}, {"user_id": "7d0503f920f2", "comment_time": 1635457244983, "comment": "Loved this!

Public Domain.\nThe thing about me and the social graces that society demands is that I can do them all fine\u2014as long as I mean them. When I mean it, I can effortlessly tell someone that I love their haircut, that I\u2019m impressed with their skills and talents, that I enjoy their turn of phrase or that I learned a lot from their insights. To me these are not social graces, they are authentic remarks. And this approach will get me so far in making friends.\nBut there\u2019s a glass ceiling. And to break the glass ceiling, you\u2019ll eventually need to flatter people you have no time for. This is when things become much, much harder. Misrepresenting myself is a dissonant experience that begins in my body and feels like I am being shaken. It\u2019s nauseating in the non-metaphorical sense and creates a disabling vibration in the bright flowing that is my inner experience. Sparks fly inside me and they burn. Mis-representing reality itself simply does not compute.\nFerrero Rocher: the praline ball of naked political ambition\nMy high school tutor\u2014who was a friend and ally\u2014wrote a letter to my mother when I finished school saying she had found me \u201cchallenging and iconoclastic, but always a pleasure\u201d.\nMy mother was happy with this seemingly positive appraisal, but I understood that my teacher meant I had been a royal pain the rear, constantly subjecting the pompous to a scrutiny they found uncomfortable and, in many cases, intolerable. And while my tutor may have quietly enjoyed that, as a kind of intelligent rebellion, most of my teachers had seen it as a series of deliberately insolent challenges to their authority. I saw it as neither. I was not remotely concerned with power, or what they thought power was. For me it was merely the essential mapping of reality.\nIf a teacher tells a whole class that a spider is an insect, they are going to get corrected. It\u2019s a force I cannot control. They might send me out of the class and keep me behind afterwards to threaten me and call me provocative, but at the end of the day, we\u2019re here to learn and the taxonomy is on my side. It\u2019s not a hard point to concede. Shouldn\u2019t their shoulders be broader? It always shocked me that they were not.\nMy school friends would have a sharp intake of breath whenever I would pipe up in class. \u201cShut up, Lewie, you\u2019re gonna get in trouble.\u201d But, to me, what would happen if I didn\u2019t speak up was much worse. My whole life has been lived like this, with a somatic inability to live with an untruth or a broken system, purely to smooth relations with an assumed power. And that makes diplomacy very, very hard. Because lying about the world to stay safe from power is what diplomacy is.\nAnd there\u2019s the rub. For me, truth is safety. Establishing a truth, for me, feels like driving a pile deep into silty ground to gain a solid footing. Each truth mapped shores up reality. The more true I can make things, the less chance we all have of sinking into the silt and being washed away. Every time someone forces me to retract a truth, because acknowledging it would ill-suit their ego, the more compromised the whole structure of reality becomes. If they kick away all of my carefully driven foundations, then everyone is lying about everything and nowhere is safe.\nI never understood how my school friends and, later, colleagues could live with these fundamental rips in space-time and pretend everything was OK. I knew I could not.\nThe first time that I made a career choice that I felt actually leaned into my personality was when I became a journalist. Surely this was the ultimate career for a pathological truth-teller? I got a shock when I realised people didn\u2019t have to take your call or tell you anything. The only way to make that happen was to curry favour. Use diplomacy.\nAfraid of failing, I learned how to lunch the powerful. I made them like me by hiding my intelligence. I would make deliberate small mistakes and allow them to correct me, then thank them for their insight. I would lay out breadcrumbs, leave them to voice the blindingly obvious conclusion, then praise their excellent idea. I would \u201caccidentally\u201d let slip something I wanted them to know, then apologise for my indiscretion. They would respond by lowering their own defences. As a result, I found these power brokers would now take my call and, eventually, they would be the ones calling me, to tell me everything I wanted to know.\nTo me, it felt diabolical, manipulative and false. How did they not see it? All in all I worked for around 12 years as a journalist and when I stopped, the relief was all-encompassing. How many lies can you tell about yourself in order to tell the truth about something else? Is it worth it? Some neurotypes are perfectly comfortable with this kind of hierarchy of truths. To them it\u2019s just the way of the world. But for me, living as a cypher had been mentally and physically exhausting. I believe I never again regained the kind of elastic energy I had in that period of my life. I feel the intense and sustained masking left me permanently spent. From that point on I would need to live more congruently, even if it meant being less successful.\nEventually, I was lucky to find a career where I was surrounded by impressive and likeable people, so the issue never came up. The piles were driven deep and things felt secure. In the meantime I trained as a psychotherapist because I felt this work would allow me to use what was authentically and congruently within me to help others heal from experiences like mine. And that is true. It works. I can offer relief.\nBut the profession \u2026 the counselling and psychotherapy profession itself is riddled with self-appointed powers, saturated with giant splintery egos exploiting the gullible, and held up by flimsy balsa-wood structures built on fine dry sand. There are many would-be emperors and they all are naked.\nAnd I feel a familiar old vibration in the bright flowing \u2026\nEnjoyed this?

If the amazing products were any good and as profitable as they said, they should have been trying to sell us the products.\nBut they weren\u2019t. Instead, they were trying to sell us entrepreneur starter kits. Mini-franchises. To people who dreamed of being their own boss but had zero ideas. The truth about MLM is the products are poor and nobody wants them. They pile up in garages. The only way to make any money in MLM is to keep recruiting gullible new members.\nIts cousin in the investment world is the Ponzi scheme.\nPonzi scheme (n) a form of fraud in which belief in the success of a non-existent enterprise is fostered by the payment of quick returns to the first investors from money invested by later investors.\nNow, let\u2019s have a look at the Medium Partner Scheme revenue structure. When people read my terrible articles I earn $0.06. Maybe $0.26. It\u2019s dust. Worse, I have no control over this: I can\u2019t forecast an income based on this, it\u2019s subject to unpredictable spikes and rapid fall-off, only cured by adding new content. Over and over again. What kind of output volume would I need in order to pull in just $100 a month? That\u2019s a huge amount of labour for very little gain. But \u2026\nBut \u2026\nIf I \ud83d\ude03\u26a0\ufe0f\u27a1\ufe0f recruit a new Medium member using my affiliate link \u2b05\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\ud83d\ude03 I get HALF their fee. That\u2019s already $2.25. That income, while still very low, is much higher and more stable than any possible return on my actual content.\nThe epiphany that it\u2019s more profitable to recruit new members to the platform than actually have them read your work should be a wake-up call for anyone hoping to use this platform to fund the dream of being a writer. In truth, the dream of getting paid for writing is being exploited here to recruit marketers for a platform whose only revenue model depends on you continuing that free labour.\nReal-onomics\nThe market for real writers has taken a real blow in real value over the last 20 years, thanks chiefly to the flourishing of free content on the internet. Like, uh, this. The money isn\u2019t what it was. Or rather, it\u2019s still exactly what it was in 1999, despite the cost of living has trebled. Today, selling your work to publishers offers a very modest return on success compared to other careers. But it is still streets ahead of hustling on a platform such as Medium: the Spotify of writing.\nIf you look at this platform as a way to free yourself of wage slavery, then you\u2019re going to be disappointed, working far harder than anyone should get a payday. And then you work out the only way to get a decent return is to recruit more people who dream of being writers. I suggest that taking this route is somewhat soul-destroying.\nIf you look upon it as a cheap way to showcase your work and evidence a readership to real editors who may someday want to commission your work for real money, then you\u2019ll probably be OK.\nHowever, if you see it as a place to spread ideas for free, make a ruckus and start a movement\u2014then you\u2019re really going to do something of value.

However, our distress is living in the present. How do we build a bridge from one to the other?\nWhen something horrible happens to us, it happens to all of us at once: it happens to our body and to our nervous system and it happens to our thoughts and emotions. However, talk therapy can sometimes forget about the body and nervous system.\nNarrative\nIf a person has survived a traumatic experience and I want to help them heal, I\u2019ll start by trying to make it feel safe to talk a little about what happened and when. The person will then begin to offer me a narrative of the past. The story of what happened may be quite defended\u2014the person may have told it before and been judged or shamed. Because of these factors, I\u2019m unlikely to hear much more than an outline. The story as originally told will often minimise impacts, such that the telling of it does not re-traumatise the teller. They may use humour to burnish the sharp edges.\nEmotion\nAs trust develops between us, I\u2019ll try to help the person feel safe to open up about how their experiences made them feel. These feelings will usually be more defended than the story, with very good reason. These are what the walls of the story hide. They speak of the person\u2019s vulnerability. A person who has been harmed has often learned to hide signs of their true vulnerability and shut down anyone who gets close to it. A lot of time in therapy therefore is spent building rapport, trust and psychological bridges so it can begin to feel safe to articulate the emotion. That is to say, the person will feel sufficiently known and accompanied that they can surface vulnerable parts of themselves without fear of being judged, rejected, shamed, shunned and abandoned to relive the full force of their trauma alone.\nBut when they come, the feelings are often in the past. This happened to me and it made me feel this way. It\u2019s important to speak this truth, but of course it is not the whole story. Because, although the events are in the past, the person is still feeling distress today. They may have grown around the wound, stoically moved on with life and they may have been outwardly successful at all of this. But they have come to therapy now because they have not healed and they are still feeling the distress right now, in the present. So the present is where we must go.\nSensation\nThe key here is to focus not on the emotion or the story, not the rationalisations or meanings we have made, but sensations in the body right now. Find where the feeling lives on in the body, what is the sensation? Does it feel like a burning spike or a cold hand in your gut, does it feel like turbulence in your insides? Do you feel sick or like you\u2019re being shaken? Is it a tightness, a compression, a pulsing? Does it have a colour or a sound or a smell?\nThe events have long gone but trauma lives on in our nervous system, in our muscles, in our state. A key part of the work is to accompany the person and make it feel safe for them to locate the source in the body and describe it. Name it. Then help them find ways to return their body to a safe state.", "comment_count": 1, "like_count": 250, "created_time": 1651311976871, "comment": [{"user_id": "4d6f9783d24b", "comment_time": 1651311976871, "comment": "Thank you for sharing!"}, {"user_id": "42fd5f553b7d", "comment_time": 1651354346439, "comment": "Richard, this is so good!

We languish in denial when a brother or sister is addicted to narcotics or alcohol. We can\u2019t face it.\nWe deny they are a terrible human being (while actively addicted). We make excuses. We let them keep wreaking havoc.\nSo it is with America and its racial legacy, white supremacy, etc. Far too many Americans continue to deny the depraved state of their country\u2019s sordid racial and racist origins and the inability to correct itself.\nThey keep acting as if white supremacy never existed and does not exist. They act as if white supremacy is a tiny pimple on someone\u2019s back rather than the whole back.\nWhite supremacy is the entire back and too many continue to deny the need to stop drinking from the vat. Stop sipping the whiskey of white supremacy. Get off the bottle. Get clean.\nThe antidote\nThe Dylan Thomas poem above is a poem about death. His father is dying and Thomas is telling his father to not go gently. Fight for every bit of this life.\nThis is like white supremacy and its supporters. It is dying. It can be dead soon if only those who need it for some reason, let it die. Denounce it. Do let go, in other words, of this unholy elixir.\nThe 1619 Project, Critical Race Theory, and anti-racism efforts are part of the cure for the evil of white supremacy. They won\u2019t end it but they are landing haymakers and staggering it.\nThat is why the hard core acolytes of white supremacy fight so hard day by day to make these liberating ideas sound ominous. They have even put anti-racists on the defensive in some instances.\nThings are so bad in some circles, people are apologizing and saying Critical Race Theory is not taught in K-12 school. They are trying to put white supremacists at ease. Imagine.\nThe answer to that is, so what if Critical Race Theory is taught in school? That would be a good thing. I teach it. It is what I would describe as a \u201cbetter idea.\u201d\nMy students, of all ethnic backgrounds, love to discuss it even though it is new to them. They enjoy intersectionality even more. These ideas counter the narrative that has been circulated forever in America to make everyone feel good.\nThose trying to silence Critical Race Theory, the 1619 Project, and anti-racism know why they want to ban it. White supremacy is an anti-human concept not rooted in facts, science, or anything other than a desire to oppress and demean others. They know the entirety of American history is on the chopping block because it is mostly, a lie.\nThey are likewise addicted to white supremacy like a drug. They are that relative of yours you see strung out on dope and can\u2019t kick, just like collectively America can\u2019t kick the drug either. They are destroying themselves and the country by continuing to use the dope.\nStatue of Dylan Thomas, by John Doubleday, 1984, in Dylan Thomas Square, Maritime Quarter, Swansea, Wales \u2014 (Creative Commons license)\nRage\nDylan Thomas, the great Welsh poet, lived a hard life. He died in 1953. His life was short and while he created great art, he also destroyed himself slowly with whiskey and cigarettes before he turned 40. Was he troubled? Surely.\nAmerica is like Dylan Thomas. It is raging against the dying of white supremacy and really how things were and will be for not much longer. It is unclear what the goal is to tell the truth.\n\u201cTime is moving on,\u201d as the Last Poets once wrote.

White supremacy is blowing it up slowly. It has kept America from becoming what it claimed it wanted to be in 1776.\nAs Thomas famously wrote (and said)\u2014 \u201cRage! Rage!

Barack Obama was President. Nancy Pelosi was Speaker of the House and the Democrats controlled the U.S. Senate. They were fully in power.\nThey could have taken care of abortion rights for women back then and many other things. They didn\u2019t. Now, a lot of people are about to pay for their lack of focus and political trickery and cowardice.\nWhen they had this veto-proof majority in Congress, they passed The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and a reauthorization for the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIPS), one of the nation\u2019s most popular programs. The Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Act also passed.\nThey did things. But abortion? Swing and a miss. In fact, they didn\u2019t even try to swing. They didn\u2019t even punt.\nOne must ask \u2014 why didn\u2019t the Democrats pass a federal law guaranteeing the right to abortion in every state in 2009?\nThe support was there. Over 70 percent of the American people supported and still support some abortion rights in America. Less than 20 percent want the practice declared illegal. This has been consistent for decades.\nAccording to the website, feminist.com, over 80 percent of U.S. counties lack abortion services. So, there is, and was a need to safeguard access and rights despite general support for the procedure. Yet, they did nothing.\nAbortion is an accepted reality in most of America. It is also an accepted reality that efforts to impede the human rights of women to control their bodies is being challenged in the U.S. and is part of the country\u2019s foundation.\nIn writing this article, I took the liberty to check and see if any Democrat introduced a bill in 2009 to codify abortion rights for women when their party controlled the government, with a filibuster proof majority. I was thinking maybe such bills were held up for some reason.\nThere were no such bills introduced. Not one. Most of the laws introduced were introduced by Republican lawmakers seeking to outlaw and/or impede the rights of women to control their bodies.\nThe Democrats are politically useless. They are not the party of change or egalitarian progress. They are a corporate party hiding behind Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal and Lyndon Johnson\u2019s Great Society.\nI am not a Democrat. I am not a Republican either. I do believe in the humanity and the human rights of women to control their bodies. I am down with fighting for that.

They won 106\u201392 and are three games away from another Eastern Conference Finals.\nThis happened despite the fact that the Heat didn\u2019t really look that dominating. Kyle Lowry, their point guard with the championship pedigree, is out. Jimmy Butler is hobbled a bit with a bad knee. And, the Heat are not that explosive anyway.\nYet, the Sixers\u2019 best player, Joel Embiid, the likely NBA regular season MVP, is still out. A concussion and a broken orbital bone kept him out and the Sixers were offensively lethargic.\nEmbiid averaged 31\u201312\u20134 this year, so somehow, Philly has to replace those stats. Not easy. More importantly, he shoots 12 free throws on average per game, wreaking havoc on the other team.\nHe also creates space for shooters because you can\u2019t ignore him inside and outside. No accident that the Sixers shot 6\u201337 from the three point line. Their season average is 13\u201334, which they have to match to have a chance to win against the top seed in the East.\nThe Heat\nWithout Kyle Lowry, the Heat looked quite ordinary. Lowry brings intensity and defense but also points and a consistent three point shot, the very best friend of aging point guards. Lowry shot 37 percent from three this year and made two per game. With him out, their outside shooting is different. He finds the open man (7 assists per game) and he scores 13 per game. The Heat aren\u2019t nearly as offensively dangerous without Lowry on the court.\nTyler Herro (25 points) made up for Lowry last night but he is going to drop 20\u201325 anyway. The Heat won last night because of defensive and scrappy play, which is their trademark. But because of their style of play, their margin is small, only about 4 points per game on average.\nWhen Embiid\u2019s 31 points and 12 rebounds returns, they will have to press even harder. They will need Lowry. I am sure of it. And a long, physical seven game series with guys already banged up, is not good for a deep, deep run into the second season, for either team expecting to win it all.\nKareem @ 75\nAnd remembering an NBA Finals performance for the agesmedium.com\nThe NBA\u2019s True MVP \u2014 Injuries\nThe championship is always decided by how teams can manage those late and second season physical setbacksmedium.com\nCBS Sports Basketball Reference Complex Sports The Sporting Press NBA InsideHoops.com NBA NBA Scholar", "comment_count": 1, "like_count": 69, "created_time": 1651587096770, "comment": [{"user_id": "87a6532fe20e", "comment_time": 1651587096770, "comment": "Thank you for sharing!"}, {"user_id": "b26df0f41bbf", "comment_time": 1651628379011, "comment": "The heat still gonna beat the sixers"}], "post_tag": ["Basketball", "NBA", "NBA Playoffs", "Sports", "Health"]}, {"author": "Claire Sewell", "post_id": "2d448c4dcf57", "user_id": "9ded6b6426bd", "title": "Fear Is the Mind-killer: On Deciding to Read Dune", "content": "Fear Is the Mind-killer: On Deciding to Read Dune\nBook cover of the 2021 movie tie-in edition\n\u201cI must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past, I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.\u201d \u2014 Litany Against Fear\nIn 2016 I realized that I had a big gap in my reading history: classic science fiction. I also turned to the genre during a time when the world seemed especially upside down. Sci-fi, in both the best of times and the worst of times, helps us to make sense of what we\u2019re experiencing in real life through escapism and allegories alike. Blade Runner 2049 was on the horizon, and I\u2019d never read anything by Philip K. Dick, so I started with his well-known novel from 1968, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sleep?. Simple enough. It\u2019s only a little over two-hundred pages, after all. Moving along in my quest, a good friend of mine who\u2019s a big Dune fan kept telling me I should read it, but I was resistant. Published in 1965 and cited as the world\u2019s bestselling science fiction novel, Dune has a reputation, and its presence looms large. A tome to say the least at over 800 pages (give or take a couple of hundred, depending on the edition), I would glance at it on bookstore shelves, convinced that it wasn\u2019t for me. Besides being intimidated by the page count, I had also fallen prey to the often repeated commentary about Dune: that the plot is impenetrable, the storyline is confusing, and the writing is dense. By 2018, a new Dune film was in the works, so I finally decided to give Frank Herbert\u2019s epic novel a go.\nThe opening to Book I of Dune\nTo my complete surprise, I was immediately drawn in to the story through Herbert\u2019s descriptive and often lyrical language. I was particularly taken with the introductions to each chapter that are presented as written by the Princess Irulan, a sort of story within a story that provides bits of necessary background. I had been afraid that Dune would be boring, but instead I found a story that was unlike anything I\u2019d ever read. Parts of it are a little long in the tooth, sure, but I think that\u2019s to be expected in a novel that works to create this level of worldbuilding. Yet, at its heart, Dune is simply a Bildungsroman, or a classic coming of age novel. Amidst all the mentions of the spice, sandworms, balisets, ornithopters, and stillsuits is the story of Paul Atreides and his perilous journey to assume his destiny as leader of the planetary Empire. Yes, there\u2019s also plenty of discourse about the novel as a white savior narrative and criticism of the films. Others have also called attention to the ways that Herbert explored the dangers of climate change before it became a mainstream issue decades later. Great literature always yields plenty of commentary, and Dune is no exception.\nAlthough the new film had already been announced, when I started reading Dune there wasn\u2019t a lot of chatter on social media about it yet. I thought it would be fun to \u201clive tweet\u201d my experience with the book so I started a Twitter thread.\n\nJust as the slow blade penetrates the shield, soon enough I was a part of the Dune fandom. Perhaps it goes without saying at this point, but Dune lends itself incredibly well to meme culture. Now that I\u2019d read the book I could understand and have a laugh at references created by other fans. And in a way that I could never have predicted, Dune became even more special to me because I found out I was pregnant while in the midst of reading it. So much so that our daughter\u2019s middle name is Irulan. Although many fans consider Irulan to be a background character, I felt deeply connected to her ability to forge her own path despite the odds and her desire to preserve the Empire\u2019s history. Dune is also the story of powerful women like the Bene Gesserit, Lady Jessica, and Chani, whose lives are explored in detail as the novel unfolds. In this way, Herbert shows us that no man is an island and that the experiences of those surrounding him deserve just as much exploration.\n\nSo if you\u2019ve seen the new film and want to get a better handle on things then you have plenty of time to catch up before part two hits theaters in 2023. I chose to read Dune on my Kindle because I\u2019ve conquered other long books in that format since it allows me to not become distracted by a looming page count. But you can take your pick from the many different versions published over the years. The 2019 Ace edition provides a fun immersive experience with a newly illustrated dust jacket and endpapers. It even has page edges stained in Fremen blue. There\u2019s also an audiobook and even a graphic novel.\nDune cover art over the years\nIt\u2019s been fun seeing all of the takes on the Internet about the new Dune as people encounter the story for the first time. If that doesn\u2019t prove that Herbert\u2019s Hugo and Nebula award-winning novel stands the test of time then I don\u2019t know what does. But it\u2019s also frustrating to see so many writers repeating the same tired things about it just for the clicks. If you\u2019ve never tried to read Dune before then how would you know if it\u2019s dense or impenetrable? I get it, though. Like a lot of other science fiction, Dune has its own unique vocabulary that definitely seems strange at first. But Frank Herbert was a journalist and researcher himself who understood a reader\u2019s hunger for knowledge, and he included three appendices to further explain the history and machinations of Dune along with a glossary of terms that are used throughout the novel. You can\u2019t say he didn\u2019t try to set us all up for success in navigating his text. I\u2019m a big believer that certain books find us at exactly the time in our lives when we need them the most, and Dune was definitely one of those books for me. I can\u2019t say that it will be the same for you, but I hope if you decide to give reading Dune a try that you\u2019ll open your mind to navigating a beautifully written story that is more relevant than ever.", "comment_count": 1, "like_count": 104, "created_time": 1635279016314, "comment": [{"user_id": "9ded6b6426bd", "comment_time": 1635279016314, "comment": "Thank you for sharing!"}, {"user_id": "5ce586ffcc5", "comment_time": 1636062564016, "comment": "This is an excellent meditation on patience.

I still think about her words often, especially as librarians are in the position of providing access to information. In order to do this, we must take the time to engage with and think critically about issues that impact our profession. So here is a librarians\u2019 advisory: a list of six books and related readings covering critical race theory, feminism, intersectionality, bias in the library catalog, and so much more. Each title links to WorldCat so you can find it in a library near you (don\u2019t forget about ILL, too).\nKnowledge Justice: Disrupting Library and Information Studies Through Critical Race Theory\n\n\u201cIn Knowledge Justice, Black, Indigenous, and Peoples of Color scholars use critical race theory (CRT) to challenge the foundational principles, values, and assumptions of Library and Information Science and Studies (LIS) in the United States. They propel CRT to center stage in LIS, to push the profession to understand and reckon with how white supremacy affects practices, services, curriculum, spaces, and policies. The contributors show that the field is deeply invested in the false idea of its own objectivity and neutrality, and they go on to show how this relates to assumptions about race. Through deep analyses of library and archival collections, scholarly communication, hierarchies of power, epistemic supremacy, children\u2019s librarianship, teaching and learning, digital humanities, and the education system, Knowledge Justice challenges LIS to reimagine itself by throwing off the weight and legacy of white supremacy and reaching for racial justice.\u201d\nRelated reading: Social Justice in Cataloging Annotated Bibliography\nPushing the Margins: Women of Color and Intersectionality in LIS\n\n\u201cUsing intersectionality as a framework, this edited collection explores the experiences of women of color in library and information science (LIS). With roots in black feminism and critical race theory, intersectionality studies the ways in which multiple social and cultural identities impact individual experience. Libraries and archives idealistically portray themselves as egalitarian and neutral entities that provide information equally to everyone, yet these institutions often reflect and perpetuate societal racism, sexism, and additional forms of oppression. Women of color who work in LIS are often placed in the position of balancing the ideal of the library and archive providing good customer service and being an unbiased environment with the lived reality of receiving microaggressions and other forms of harassment on a daily basis from both colleagues and patrons. This book examines how lived experiences of social identities affect women of color and their work in LIS.\u201d\nRelated reading: White Librarianship in Blackface: Diversity Initiatives in LIS, by April Hathcock\nBookishness: Loving Books in a Digital Age\n\n\u201cTwenty-first-century culture is obsessed with books. In a time when many voices have joined to predict the death of print, books continue to resurface in new and unexpected ways. From the proliferation of \u201cshelfies\u201d to Jane Austen\u2013themed leggings and from decorative pillows printed with beloved book covers to bookwork sculptures exhibited in prestigious collections, books are everywhere and are not just for reading. Writers have caught up with this trend: many contemporary novels depict books as central characters or fetishize paper and print thematically and formally. In Bookishness, Jessica Pressman examines the new status of the book as object and symbol. She explores the rise of \u201cbookishness\u201d as an identity and an aesthetic strategy that proliferates from store-window d\u00e9cor to experimental writing. Ranging from literature to kitsch objects, stop-motion animation films to book design, Pressman considers the multivalent meanings of books in contemporary culture.\u201d\nRelated reading: Weeding Is Fundamental: On Libraries and Throwing Away Books, by Claire Sewell\nFeminist and Queer Information Studies Reader\n\n\u201cIn Feminist and Queer Information Studies Reader, Keilty and Dean put the field of Information Studies into critical conversation with studies of gender, sexuality, race, and technology. In classic and original essays, renowned scholars from a range of disciplines think through a broad array of information and technology philosophies and practices. Conceiving of \u201cinformation\u201d in a broad sense, the contributors reevaluate conventional methods and topics within Information Studies to examine encounters with information phenomena and technology that do not lend themselves easily to the scientific and behaviorist modes of description that have long dominated the field. A Foreword, Introduction, and Afterword provide helpful context to the reader\u2019s 27 essays, arranged around topics that include information as gendered labor, cyborgs and cyberfeminism, online environments, information organization, information extraction and flow, archives, and performance.\u201d\nRelated reading: Vocational Awe and Librarianship: The Lies We Tell Ourselves, by Fobazi Ettarh\nNot Free, Not for All: Public Libraries In the Age of Jim Crow\n\n\u201cIn Not Free, Not for All, Cheryl Knott traces the establishment, growth, and eventual demise of separate public libraries for African Americans in the South, disrupting the popular image of the American public library as historically welcoming readers from all walks of life. Using institutional records, contemporaneous newspaper and magazine articles, and other primary sources together with scholarly work in the fields of print culture and civil rights history, Knott reconstructs a complex story involving both animosity and cooperation among whites and blacks who valued what libraries had to offer. African American library advocates, staff, and users emerge as the creators of their own separate collections and services with both symbolic and material importance, even as they worked toward dismantling those very institutions during the era of desegregation.\u201d\nRelated reading: A History of US Public Libraries, by the Digital Public Library of America (DPLA)\nCruising the Library: Perversities In the Organization of Knowledge\n\n\u201cCruising the Library offers a highly innovative analysis of the history of sexuality and categories of sexual perversion through a critical examination of the Library of Congress and its cataloging practices. Taking the publication of Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick\u2019s Epistemologies of the Closet as emblematic of the Library\u2019s inability to account for sexual difference, Melissa Adler embarks upon a detailed critique of how cataloging systems have delimited and proscribed expressions of gender, sexuality, ethnicity, and race in a manner that mirrors psychiatric and sociological attempts to pathologize non-normative sexual practices and civil subjects. \u2026 Cruising the Library provides us with a critical understanding of library science, an alternative view of discourses around the history of sexuality, and an analysis of the relationship between governmentality and the cataloging of research and information \u2014 as well as categories of difference \u2014 in American culture.\u201d\nRelated reading: Queering the Catalog: Queer Theory and the Politics of Correction, by E.

I love it! Why? Because it means more space on the shelves for new books and other materials that are of current interest to our patrons. Weeding is a fundamental part of the life cycle of the library, but I get it. The decisions librarians make to get rid of books are often confusing and mysterious, especially when a photo of a dumpster full of books starts making the rounds on the Internet.\nA dumpster of weeded books outside a Chicago area school\nI never thought that weeding books would become so integral to both my job and my identity as a librarian. Although I mentioned before that I love throwing away books I can still be a little precious about them, too. I collect vintage paperbacks at home and enjoy the thrill of a unique find at a used bookstore or in someone\u2019s Little Free Library if I get really lucky. So, believe me: I understand. On first glance, seeing a dumpster full of books can seem completely antithetical to everything libraries are supposed to stand for as repositories of knowledge. Yet each time this happens I also see the same concerns about why libraries are throwing away what seem like perfectly good books. I\u2019ll never be able to stop the social media outrage, but I\u2019d like to address some of the common questions about weeding and arguments against putting books in the trash in the hopes of alleviating some of the frustration.\nWhat exactly is this \u201cweeding\u201d process, anyway?\nAccording to the American Library Association (ALA):\nWeeding or the deselection of material is critical to collection maintenance and involves the removal of resources from the collection. All materials are considered for weeding based on accuracy, currency, and relevancy. Space limitations, edition, format, physical condition, and number of copies are considered when evaluating physical materials.\nThis process is also called deaccessioning, and you might encounter the acronyms CREW and MUSTIE used by librarians to describe the processes by which we evaluate books for removal from collections. Every library has specific criteria for weeding, but physical condition and currency tend to get the most focus.\nPeople usually don\u2019t have a problem with books that are weeded based on conspicuous conditions such as mold, \u201crepairs\u201d with duct tape, or being covered in sewage \u2014 all issues that I\u2019ve personally dealt with. Old manuals for outdated computer programs like WordPerfect 3.0 or tips and tricks for browsing the Internet on Netscape are also usually obvious enough choices. It\u2019s the copies of the \u201cclassics\u201d that tend to tug at the heart strings of book lovers around the world. Yet when I take a closer look at the photo above I see editions of several books I was assigned to read in high school. I graduated in 2002, which means those copies are at least almost 20 years old (ouch). So if those books are still being assigned at that school then it\u2019s likely the case that space was needed for new copies that haven\u2019t been passed around thousands of times.\nCurrent Folger Shakespeare Library edition\nDifferent libraries also have different collection needs depending on the populations they serve. My current position is at an academic research library. We keep a lot of stuff. A LOT. So much that we actually have an off-site facility where we store materials that can be requested by our patrons. But this isn\u2019t the case for the vast majority of libraries, especially school and public ones. Old, outdated, damaged, or simply low circulating books have to be weeded on a regular basis in order for us to make space for new books that you\u2019ll actually want to check out.\nWhy not sell or simply give the books away instead?\nIn fact, I used to work for a large public library system that does hold annual book sales. It\u2019s no small feat, though. This library system has a separate non-profit group that runs and maintains those sales and then donates the funds back to the library system every year. I\u2019ll give you two guesses as to where a lot of those books come from. Yes, a good deal of them were weeded, but a lot of them were donations that were just not appropriate for current library collections. Many government funded libraries are also not allowed to sell discarded books or the process required to do so is not manageable by staff who are already overworked and underpaid.\nSometimes the demand for yet another edition of Romeo and Juliet or Brave New World just isn\u2019t there, either. A photo of a dumpster full of books can create community demand where it didn\u2019t previously exist, but this isn\u2019t the same thing as perceived general demand. This also isn\u2019t the same thing as censorship or book burning, but that\u2019s an essay for another day. Furthermore, students today deserve the opportunity to read current books that they can more easily identify with. The \u201cclassics\u201d are not universal. I\u2019m going to state that again:\nThe \u201cclassics\u201d are not universal.\nAren\u2019t there shelters, prisons, or other groups who would want these books?\nMaybe, but this process is complicated, too. It is definitely possible to donate books to prison libraries and incarcerated folks, but there are rules that vary by individual state about what\u2019s allowed. For instance, lots of prisons won\u2019t accept hardcover books or, unsurprisingly, books in bad condition. Check out the programs below to get a better idea of how it works and what you can do to help in this area.\nBooks to Prisoners Programs\nBooks to Prisons Alabama , Tuscaloosa AL Serves: TX and AL via DC Books to Prisoners California Pages and Time , Los\u2026prisonbookprogram.org\nDonate to Jail & Prison Libraries\nGreenlight Booklist In 2020, we worked with library staff at three public library systems to establish the PLSN\u2026plsn-nyc.tumblr.com\nShelters also work hard to help lots of different populations that need assistance with housing, food, and other critical needs. To be quite honest, books probably just aren\u2019t at the top of their list of priorities. They may not have the time or even the space to house book donations. Still, if you have books that you\u2019d like to donate, make the time and effort yourself to call and see if local organizations are interested and able to take them. The American Library Association also provides a helpful Book Donation Programs libguide that has more information and guidelines about how to donate books to libraries and other organizations.\nOld computer books thrown away by me.\nFinally, let\u2019s also take a moment to consider the optics of giving old and outdated books to groups that are perceived as low income or less fortunate. While well intentioned, this suggestion actually comes from a place of privilege. Basically, it says that they should be okay with settling for other people\u2019s cast offs. Something is often better than nothing, but that shouldn\u2019t always be the standard that guides us in our desire to help others. Consider giving money to organizations in your community who purchase and donate new books to populations in need.\nKids Need to Read | Providing Books to Disadvantaged Children\nKids Need to Read is a national nonprofit foundation that promotes childhood literacy and addresses the crisis in\u2026www.kidsneedtoread.org\n18 Literacy Charities to Donate to This Year | Book Riot\nAs the year comes to a close, many of us start thinking of ways to give back to our communities, whether as holiday\u2026bookriot.com\nAnd while you\u2019re at it, contact your elected officials and tell them to support full funding for libraries and keeping libraries in schools.\nWon\u2019t somebody just please think of the books??\nYes. We do! We think a lot about them, actually, because it\u2019s our job. I hope it\u2019s a little more obvious now that those books in the dumpster have already gone through a weeding process that took a good deal of time and careful thought. Librarians work hard to maintain collections that serve and benefit everyone.

Despite maintaining the same art style as ever-popular franchise movies including Monsters University (2013), Finding Dory (2017), Incredibles 2 (2018), and Toy Story 4 (2019), recent diverse and inclusive Disney-Pixar movies have gotten heat for perpetuating the \u201clazy\u201d art of \u201cCal Arts Style,\u201d a term that has defined several different animation aesthetics since 2010.\nWhat is \u201cCal Arts Style\u201d?\nThe term \u201cCal Arts Style\u201d was coined in the 2010 by animator John Kricfalusi in order to mock the animation style allegedly being taught at the California Institute of the Arts \u2014 aka \u201cCal Arts\u201d \u2014 on his blog. The original definition was that of an art style \u201cderived from late 1950s to 1970s Disney Movies \u2014 and Don Bluth \u2014 who emulates 1960s Disney movies\u201d being taught to students at Cal Arts.\nKricfalusi criticized Cal Arts Style for being repetitive, lazy, and copy-paste, using all the same line art \u2014 especially eyes, hands, and mouths \u2014 across several different animated feature films. The original blog post was concerned almost entirely with \u201crecycled\u201d line art in a particular hand-drawn style.\nSince the 2010s, the definition of \u201cCal Arts Style\u201d has become far less concrete. For several years it was used (primarily on Tumblr) to describe the \u201cbean head\u201d style of popular cartoons including Adventure Time, Steven Universe, and Gravity Falls, none of which use directly \u201crecycled\u201d frames in the same way that Disney was often guilty of during their celluloid era. Instead, they use generic shapes in character design that make the art style simplified and easily reproducible.\nExamples of the supposed \u201cbean head\u201d phenomenon; image via Know Your Meme\nThis version of Cal Arts Style is a particular brand of thin line art depicting characters with comprised of rounded shapes: big bean-shaped heads, small rounded bodies, solid pupils, gummy-worm grins, and noodle arms. These characters appear boneless, over-simplified with comedically exaggerated facial expressions and little to no shading or detail. When 3-D animation took over classic line art, \u201cCal Arts Style\u201d came to refer to the current Pixar animated film style, despite barely resembling the thin-line, unshaded, detail-less art of 2010s cartoons.\nFinding New Ways to Be Derogatory\n\u201cCal Arts Style\u201d is a controversial term in the animation world because it is \u2014 rather lazily \u2014 used almost exclusively to refer to whatever style is currently trending in the industry. According to Kelsey McCarthy writing for Redbubble, calling animation \u201cCal Arts Style\u201d has become a \u201csomewhat derogatory\u201d shorthand for being a \u201clazy artist,\u201d since animation using generic, rounded shapes can be \u201ceasily copied\u201d and therefore are \u201cthought of as being unoriginal.\u201d\nBecause the benchmark for what \u201ccounts\u201d as Cal Arts Style is constantly changing, the term has essentially become meaningless in actual discussions of animation. If it was used to exclusively refer to the thin-line, bean-headed style of shows like Steven Universe, it would at least have a purpose outside of being a rather rude way to call and artist\u2019s style lazy or unoriginal. Instead, it has become a \u201ccatch-all\u201d for animation deemed too simplistic, stylized, or \u201ccartoony,\u201d and therefore adds nothing to animation discourse.\nThe four films I presented at the start of this article look nothing like Steven Universe \u2014and they can\u2019t, because 3-D animation requires a significantly different skill set than line art and is, well, not flat. Pixar\u2019s 3-D movies have fantastic texture, shading, consistency, and variability, all things lacking in what was previously called \u201cCal Arts Style.\u201d Calling movies like Soul and Luca \u201cCal Artsy\u201d only makes sense if the term has become a shorthand for something else \u2014 either simply \u201cbeing mainstream,\u201d or something much more insidious, like racism.\n\nAn example: Recently, @Bolverk15 tweeted that \u201cPixar fell off so f \u2014 ing hard\u201d and shared an image from the studio\u2019s upcoming release, Turning Red (2022). In a quote-tweet of @Bolverk15, Twitter user @siberlikon commented,\n\u201cnot sure why but blk ppl [Black people] really f \u2014 ing love this ugly dog shit\u201d.\nUh oh: @siberlikon has said the quiet part out loud. (Edit 01/04/22: The account has since been suspended.)\nTurning Red, the latest in a series of films with a culturally diverse cast of characters, has been subjected to horrendous reviews\u2026 and it isn\u2019t even out yet! Riding the tails of stand-alone movies Coco (2017), Soul (2020), and Luca (2021) \u2014 as well as Disney\u2019s Encanto (2021)\u2014against the regular flood of nostalgia-bait sequels, Turning Red features a Chinese-Canadian preteen learning to cope with the unexpected bodily changes puberty brings (i.e., turning into a giant red panda). It is also first Pixar movie directed entirely by a woman, Domee Shi, and features the first-ever fully female leadership team, from producer Lindsey Collins through the art and story departments.\nAs it turns out, \u201canimation bros\u201d don\u2019t take too kindly to women and racial minorities \u201cinvading\u201d an industry that has been predominantly white and male since the 1930s. Just as there were protests about the all-female reboot of Ghostbusters before the movie was even finished, so too has there been an outcry about the number of recent movies highlighting nonwhite experiences.\nWhile legitimate criticisms can be made about movies like Soul and whether it appropriately captured the experience of being a struggling Black jazz musician in America, these nuanced discussions of representation have very frequently been drowned out by the screeching of the anti-Woke crowd who decided the movie was bad without ever watching it.\n\u201cCal Arts Style\u201d Isn\u2019t Real\nThe argument that animation has devolved into a \u201clazy\u201d game of cut-and-paste is flat out wrong, and deliberately disingenuous. If we go back to the example of the \u201cbean head\u201d style I showed above versus the official character renders in the same pose, it is obvious that the similarities between character designs across cartoon IPs has been greatly exaggerated:\n\nWhile in the first image it appeared as though all these characters shared the same face, they actually do not: they just share a similar vibe, and that vibe has been very popular and successful in the last few years. Calling art \u201cCal Arts Style\u201d is mostly just a smokescreen used to attack anything cute, bright, colorful, round, or just not hyper-masculine. You know, the sort of things that young women are often drawn to.\nAnything even remotely cute, feminine, progressive, inclusive, or \u201cSJW-y\u201d (whatever that means) has been co-opted into this conversation of \u201cCal Arts Style,\u201d when such a thing\u2026 doesn\u2019t really exist? Many artists and animators who have never stepped foot in California, let alone at the California Institute of the Arts, have adopted a digital line art that is reflective of current trends in children\u2019s cartoons, but each IP is, in fact, visually distinct and the artists involved worked incredibly hard on them. The same goes for recent 3-D animated films: trends in visual style do not mean artists are getting \u201clazy\u201d!\nGranted, those who have been making pronouncements about Pixar\u2019s recent lineup are in the vocal minority, and their tweets \u2014 including @Bolverk15\u2019s criticism of Turning Red \u2014 are often ratio\u2019d, gaining far more comments than likes. Those comments demonstrate that for most viewers, not only is there nothing wrong with Pixar\u2019s animation, but the fact that their last several stand-alone films have been racially and culturally diverse is appealing, rather than a drawback.\nThe Rivera family from Pixar\u2019s Coco (2017), \u00a9 Pixar Animation Studios / Walt Disney Studios\nIn Coco (2017), D\u00eda de Muertos (Day of the Dead) traditions are celebrated alongside the art, music, clothing and other cultural traditions of Mexico. Set entirely in Santa Cecilia (and the spirit world), Coco follows a Mexican child learning about his family, heritage, and cultural customs while pursuing his dream of becoming a famous musician.\nFinal Jazz Photography from Soul (2020) \u00a9 Pixar Animation Studios / Walt Disney Studios, image via Cinematography With Soul: Representing a Diverse World by Leif Pedersen\nIn Soul (2020), a uniquely African American experience of music, specifically jazz \u2014 which has a rich tradition in Harlem that spans back to ragtime, blues, and the call-and-response style of work song developed by enslaved people in antebellum America\u2014 is showcased. A vibrant array of Black characters populate the New York City of Soul, rather than the white-washed NYC we\u2019re used to seeing on shows like Friends and Sex and the City.\nPromotional material for Luca (2021), \u00a9 Pixar Animation Studios / Walt Disney Studios\nIn Luca (2021), two young sea monsters try to blend in among humans in a small Italian town circa 1960. The central theme of the movie is about accepting bodily difference \u2014 not everyone\u2019s body looks the same, but that doesn\u2019t meant they aren\u2019t valuable members of the community. One of the main characters is a fisherman with a limb difference (he is missing one arm) whose acceptance of the boys is the first step in the town\u2019s reckoning with its xenophobic treatment of their semi-aquatic neighbours.\nPromotional material for Turning Red (2022), \u00a9 Pixar Animation Studios / Walt Disney Studios\nIn Turning Read (2022), a Chinese-Canadian tween must learn how to control a confusing change in her body: when experiencing intense emotions, she turns into a giant red panda! As an allegory for reaching menarche, Turning Red will break significant new ground when it come to depicting puberty in a Pixar film, as well as having a diverse set of primary and secondary characters.\nWhat do these films all have in common? They share a visual identity and aesthetic with one another and Pixar\u2019s other films \u2014 a style of big, round heads, empty mouths with blocky teeth, soft edges, geometric shapes, bold colour palettes, and realistic textures. They also teach our children how to be empathetic; to see other cultures as beautiful; to live a day in someone else\u2019s shoes; to fight for their passions and pursue their dreams; to see others as complex, unique human beings; and to see beyond the markers of race, culture, gender, and disability to the values we share and the communities we can build together.\nIf the characters in these films all have big heads and chicklet teeth, so be it!\nI\u2019m loving the direction that Pixar and Disney have taken in the last few years. The focus on reproducing particular times and spaces (contemporary Mexico and New York City, 1960s Italy, 2003 Toronto\u2019s Chinatown) and the lived experiences of the people who populate those spaces \u2014 even if they live more magical lives than we do \u2014 is leading to more nuanced and thoughful stories that will be cherished for years to come.\nSupport the author:\nIf you\u2019re enjoying my content, consider showing your support by buying me a coffee.

I stopped dead in my tracks halfway across the street and then had to hurry to make it to the other side before the light changed.\nThe loon: its modulating tremolo unmistakable. One of the few bird calls I can identify in an instant. I hadn\u2019t heard it in so long.\nI grew up in Ontario, Canada. The loon is so ubiquitous there that it is the face of our one-dollar coin, which we affectionately call the Loonie.

A child on a paddleboat, I watched the moon rise over the glassy lake. Far in the distance: that sound. Canada, my home.\nThe loon call reminds me of Heritage Minutes, sixty-second local history lessons interspersed between commercials on Canadian television stations. The sound has been used as a shorthand for North American settings on TV and in movies for as long as soundscapes have existed; you hear a loon, you know something is set in Ontario or Michigan or perhaps Maine.

I have always struggled with insomnia, but as I get older I have come to realize that getting enough (and good-quality) sleep is vital to both my health and my productivity. When I sleep poorly, I know the day ahead will not be as successful as it could have been.\nI have always had trouble sleeping. Sounds and smells and light and even air movement can prevent me from falling asleep. Until very recently, it wasn\u2019t unusual for me to be up until 3.00 am most nights. During my undergraduate years, I would often stay up until 4.00 or even 5.00 in the morning, tossing and turning. Checking my phone. Calculating how much time I had left to sleep. Getting up to pee. Rearranging my bed.\nOne leg in, one leg out. Roll over. Flip pillow. Repeat. The dance of the insomniac will be familiar to many readers. The restless legs, the sudden itch, the urge to change position. One more drink of water. One more story. I\u2019ll just check Twitter really quick.\nThe next thing you know, your alarm is blaring and you have to get up.\nInsomnia is an illness\nChronic insomnia can be debilitating. It isn\u2019t something talked about enough, considering the number of people who suffer from poor sleep. The Cleveland Clinic estimates that up to 70 million Americans per year suffer from sleep disorders. Up to 50% of the adult population will experience occasional insomnia, while 10\u201315% suffer from chronic insomnia. It is more common in women and in adults over 60.\nNot only can a lack of sleep cause you to be irritable, anxious, or depressed and create or worsen mental health problems, but it can also affect your physical health. We know that poor sleep increases your risk of developing diabetes, high blood pressure (hypertension), heart disease, and stroke, as well as contributing to weight gain and obesity.\nLack of sleep is also shown to decrease your ability to fight infections and viruses by weakening your natural immune system. The cytokines produced during REM sleep are necessary for healing infection and inflammation, as well as for the creation of antibodies. (During a pandemic, sleep is more important than ever.)\nPhoto by Matthew Henry on Unsplash\nHow can I improve my sleep?\nI have been asking myself lately: How can I improve my sleep? I already know that I am not sleeping well. I have trouble falling asleep, trouble staying asleep, and in the morning, I struggle to wake up!\nFor me, removing distractions has been a huge help. My husband snores and talks in his sleep, and while I find it adorable (if sometimes irritating), it is very hard to fall asleep while listening to another person sleeping\u2026 loudly. Earplugs have helped me to reduce the irritation of external noise. The neighbours can now have a party without me wanting to scream at them!\nLight in my room has also been a recurring issue. For the last year or so, I\u2019ve tried various sleep masks. While it may seem gimmicky, reducing light has helped tremendously. Even with blackout curtains, no room is truly dark enough for those of us with thin eyelids. The power bar has a tiny red light on it. The smoke detector on the ceiling has a little green indicator. These used to jump out at me but, with a thick enough mask, become invisible.\nA weighted mask has proven even nicer. I received a sleep mask for Christmas this year that provides gentle pressure and total darkness. A bit like a weighted blanket, the sleep mask has glass microbeads that provide deep pressure stimulation to the orbits. You can even freeze it for a cooling effect that is supposed to help with migraines, though I haven\u2019t tried it yet.\nPhoto by bruce mars on Unsplash\nNow that I\u2019ve blocked out all light and sound, you\u2019d think that my sleep would be perfect, right? Well, no. I\u2019ve still been struggling with insomnia. I have chronic pain that predominantly affects my lower back and hips, and lying in the same position for too long causes me to ache. One thing that has helped is the quality and position of my pillows.\nA firm pillow can go a surprisingly long way in alleviating nighttime aches. Proper neck support is surprisingly effective, as is placing a firm pillow between your knees. It makes rolling over slightly more complicated, but in my experience, you\u2019ll need to roll around less to get comfortable if you place a firm pillow between your legs. Here is an article that lists the benefits of sleeping with a pillow between your knees:\nSleeping With a Pillow Between Your Knees: 10 Benefits | Casper Blog\nWhile it might look a little strange, sleeping with a pillow between your knees can be excellent for your sleep health\u2026casper.com\nIn my personal experience, having proper hip alignment reduces pain and inflammation, leading to better quality sleep. Having to roll over and change position fewer times during the night means fewer interruptions in the REM cycle.\nAs an autistic person who is sensitive to textures, I find that having the right kinds of sheets and blankets is also essential to sleeping well. I prefer a heavy blanket that provides pressure and stability throughout the night, but also one soft enough to touch my skin. A scratchy or thin blanket can ruin a night\u2019s sleep for me. Clean, soft sheets make a bed much easier to sleep in.\nI\u2019m still struggling\nEven with all these measures in place, I struggle with insomnia. Recently, I\u2019ve begun taking melatonin tablets before bed, and that has also helped some. Your body produces melatonin naturally, but many people with insomnia are deficient in this sleep hormone. Unlike other sleep medications, you are unlikely to become dependent on melatonin, have a diminished response after repeated use, or experience a hangover.\nI discovered that taking a whole melatonin pill at the dose I purchased was too much for me, and made me groggy in the day that followed. Having broken my tablets in half, the smaller dosage seems to do the trick of making me sleepier before bed, but not once I wake up. If you plan to take a medication or supplement, research what dose is appropriate for someone of your age, size, and sex. Discuss with a doctor if you have any concerns.\nBeing sensitive to medications has always been part of my life. I have an extremely low alcohol tolerance, and often need a smaller dosage of other medications. Reducing my caffeine intake has helped me to sleep better. As much as we all love coffee \u2014 and of course, Coffee Times \u2014 having too much caffeine in your diet can impact the quality and timing of your sleep. On the days when I have had a Coke after 4.00 pm, I know I will struggle to fall asleep. I may even have panicky, intrusive thoughts well into the morning. If you have anxiety, consider reducing your caffeine intake wherever possible.\nPhoto by Slumber Sleep Aid on Unsplash\nEach of the methods I discussed here has helped to reduce or eliminate one of the problems I face when it comes to getting quality sleep at night. Just doing one thing or the other would not be enough for me: I require a combination of efforts to get myself in the correct mood, position, and disposition to sleep soundly.\nThat being said, I can say with certainty that these measures have helped me to sleep through the night (sometimes without waking up once when I used to be up once per hour). I have been able to wake up easier in the morning, and go to bed at a more reasonable hour (sometimes even before midnight!).\nThese are the things that have helped me sleep better:\nearplugs\nweighted eye mask\nfirm pillows\nhip alignment with a pillow for support\nheavy blanket\nsoft sheets\ncomfortable sleep clothing\nmelatonin supplements\nreducing caffeine\nNot all of these will work for every person, but I hope that others who suffer from insomnia and poor sleep can find the combination of factors that work for them. Sleeping better is in all of our best interests.\nWhat helps you to sleep better at night? Did I miss any factors?

It\u2019s been popular for a while now to categorize people by when they were born \u2014 boomers, Gen X, millennials, Gen Z \u2014 as a shorthand for a particular kind of experience. Being born in 1995, there are many ways that we feel like cuspie \u201czennials,\u201d having gotten a taste of both experiences.\nOr so we thought.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t used a floppy disk either,\u201d Rhys told me the other night when I brought up the story of my Irish students as an example of the difference between millennials and Gen Z. \u201cMost people our age haven\u2019t.\u201d\nPhoto of a floppy disk by Onur Buz on Unsplash\nI thought he was crazy. He\u2019d never used a floppy disk? What was he doing from 1997 to 2005? His answer: using CDs. And then USB thumb drives.\nThat\u2019s when I realized that even being born in the same year doesn\u2019t guarantee you grew up in the same generation. The more we talked about it, the more we realized that while we had assumed we had the same experiences growing up \u2014 we were in the same grade, in the same regional school district \u2014 our experiences couldn\u2019t have been more different.\nAt my elementary school, we saved our work on hard floppy disks. My floppy was orange and had my name written on it in Sharpie. The school computers (tower desktops that ran on Windows 95) blocked all social media, including email, so it was the only way to transfer files or hand in a digital copy of an assignment.\nThe last thing I remember saving on a floppy was a project I did in sixth grade involving stop-motion animation. We used a top-of-the-line digital camera to take stills of clay figures we\u2019d made, edited them together into a movie on a Windows XP computer, and saved the movie on a floppy disk. I still have it, somewhere. I was 12 years old.\nMy partner, on the other hand, has not only never handled a floppy disk, but has never even used a rewritable CD. I distinctly remember when our computer labs got upgraded in seventh grade and we could, for the first time, burn CD-ROMs. My friends and I downloaded music from Napster and made \u201cmixtapes\u201d for each other on CDs. We played them in our Walkmans (portable CD players, with headphones).\nPhoto of my older sister using the family computer, surrounded by loose CDs, circa 2001\nWe called these CDs mixtapes because kids our age \u2014 13 in 2008 \u2014 had grown up with cassette tapes. My first portable music player was a pink Barbie cassette player that had been my sister\u2019s, which I used until I got my first Walkman when I was seven. When I was a toddler, we\u2019d had the Barney, Elmo, and Mickey Mouse Club soundtracks on cassettes for long car trips.\nMy partner has never burned a CD-ROM. He had never listened to a cassette tape. He had a VCR, but grew up thinking that the Disney movies on VHS his family owned were antiquated technology. He can\u2019t remember ever having to rewind a VHS with a pencil. He never taped a TV show or movie on a VHS using a VCR. His family never even had TiVo or DVR, they just bought box sets or downloaded shows from the internet. His family got a PlayStation 3 just to play Blu-rays \u2014 in 2006.\nIn 2006, my family had a VCR/DVD player combo. We still regularly used VHS tapes. I had my own tape, with a homemade label that said, \u201cCasey\u2019s Tape of Awesomeness,\u201d that I used to record shows that were on during dinner, after bedtime, or during school. Before we upgraded VHS players, someone had to manually hit \u201crecord\u201d at the right time, and the TV had to be on the right channel. I had to beg my mom or my sister to remember to tape Star Trek for me if I didn\u2019t want to miss an episode. Getting a DVR-capable Cogeco box in 2009 or so was a luxury in comparison: you could set it to record shows automatically, it could do three simultaneously (no fighting over whose show got taped!), and it was all digital storage, no tapes!\nPhoto of a Nintendo64 by Pat Moin on Unsplash\nRhys\u2019s first video game console was a GameCube, followed closely by the Wii and PS3. Mine was the Nintendo 64, eventually followed by the GameCube.\nHis family had wireless internet from the time he was a baby. My family had dial-up internet that went through the phone line until late 2007.\nWe had one internet-capable \u201cfamily computer\u201d that was kept first in the den, then in my grandmother\u2019s bedroom. It ran on Windows 95. He had his own desktop computer with Wi-Fi in his bedroom as a child.\nHow could two people who are the exact same age, from the same place, and from similar socioeconomic backgrounds, have such different experiences?\nI have an older sister, born in 1991, which means that many of my childhood toys were bought before I was born. The Nintendo 64 came out in 1996. While you wouldn\u2019t buy a gaming console for a one-year-old, you might get one for a precocious five- or six-year-old. I grew up having that N 64 in the house, playing Donkey Kong; Hey You, Pikachu!; Mario Kart; Mario Party; and classic games like Tetris and Space Invaders. I inherited my sister\u2019s original Game Boy before graduating to a Game Boy Color and eventually a DS.\nThe author and her sister holding dogs, circa 2002\nGetting hand-me-downs meant that perhaps I was more familiar with older tech than zennial cuspies who, like Rhys, are the oldest sibling. We had cassettes because that\u2019s what was available for kids\u2019 music in 1992. We had movies on VHS because that\u2019s what my sister watched. I was into Spice Girls and the Backstreet Boys because that\u2019s what my sister listened to.\nRhys, on the other hand, got everything new in the late \u201990s, as a firstborn. By 1996, CDs were the way to go, not cassettes. DVDs started replacing VHS around the same time. He grew up on media that was also appropriate for his younger brother, who is solidly Gen Z.\nBoth our fathers were \u201ccomputer guys\u201d in the \u201990s, but his dad worked as a network engineer and had access to the latest technology. My dad repaired PCs as a side gig, and most of our tech was cobbled together out of the parts of old, broken machines. My dad and I build a tower desktop out of spare parts when I was six; if it was used for anything other than word processing and MS Paint, it would overheat and crash after only an hour. (If playing The Sims, I had about 30 minutes before alarms would go off and it would auto-shutdown to prevent a fire.)\nI identify firmly as a millennial, despite not fitting one of the main \u201ccriteria\u201d: being able of remembering 9/11/2001. My memory prior to 2002 is shoddy as best, and I\u2019ve only got the faintest inkling of what 9/11 was like. On the other hand, I remember so much of what the world was like before 9/11, if only because, through my sister, I was experiencing shifts in technology slightly later than some of my peers.\nI remember a time without internet access, or with very limited internet access. I\u2019ve not only seen and handled, but used:\nFloppy floppy disks, the soft, flexible plastic precursors to the \u201chard\u201d floppy disk\nHard floppy disks\nA DOS computer\nDial-up internet\nAOL, Ask Jeeves, Neopets\nCassettes\nVHS tapes\nTape recorder\nAnswering machine with tape\nA \u201cbrick\u201d phone, with an extendable antenna\nHome movies filmed on Super 8\nCRT \u201cbox\u201d televisions\n8-bit video games (SNES, Atari)\nWind-up, disposable cameras\nI remember turning in a roll of film at Walmart or Kinko\u2019s and waiting two weeks to see if the pictures turned out. I remember peeking at the film negatives to try to see if the pictures would be good.\nFor me, being a millennial means having grown up at a time when technology was rapidly changing, and constantly having to adapt to those changes. Being born before many of the conveniences of today\u2019s internet-savvy kids were widely available, we had to learn these new and exciting tools on the fly.\nI remember a time before YouTube. I remember the dawn of social media.\nI remember having to be home before the streetlights came on. Knocking on a stranger\u2019s door to use their phone to call home when I fell off my bike. Wall-phones with curly cords that had to be used standing in the right place. Trying to fold a paper map back up after checking directions. Later, printing out directions from MapQuest (pre-Google Maps).\nMy parents are a few years older than my partner\u2019s parents. Most of my favourite movies and music are from the \u201980s and early \u201990s, because that\u2019s what was played in my house. You\u2019ve Got Mail triggers nostalgia for me. My favourite song as a kid was \u201cTainted Love\u201d by Soft Cell. I know far too many INXS and Rolling Stones lyrics.\nPhoto by Jeremy Bezanger on Unsplash\nSome people define millennials as being the \u201clast generation to remember 9/11.\u201d If that\u2019s the case, then Rhys is a millennial and I\u2019m not. Some people define millennials as being the \u201clast generation to grow up without the internet\u201d or who \u201cremember a time before the internet was ubiquitous.\u201d If that\u2019s the case, I\u2019m a millennial and Rhys isn\u2019t.\nAm I a millennial because I had a Tamagotchi and a Trapper Keeper? Because I rented VHS tapes from Blockbuster Video? Because I had a digital alarm clock radio? Because I bought Aqua songs on CD? Because I collected Pok\u00e9mon cards?\nOr am I a Gen Z because I don\u2019t remember 9/11? Because I got my first cell phone at 14? Because I have a TikTok account? Because I keep all my data in the cloud?\nWhen we categorize people by the year they were born and assume that the majority of people in that \u201cgeneration\u201d had the same experiences, we\u2019re making a lot of assumptions. We\u2019re assuming everyone had the same kind of access to the latest technology, which just isn\u2019t the case. It is a very Western-centric view that ignores that people in other countries had and still have very different relationships to things like fashion, computers, and media.\nNot everyone was a middle-class, white child in America, and even if they were, most families held onto and repaired older technology rather than upgrading every time something new came to market until very recently. I know people who had their first laptop at six years old, and others grew up without a computer altogether.\nWe all know millennials are killing the napkin industry. And diamonds, department stores, cereal, cable TV. But what if we kill the idea that there are \u201cgenerations\u201d at all? It isn\u2019t at all useful to categorize people this way, rather than by, say, life stage. \u201cFirst-time homebuyers\u201d and \u201cearly career researchers\u201d are far more useful to understand where someone is in their life, that isn\u2019t dependent on age.\nSaying \u201cpeople who grew up with a computer\u201d doesn\u2019t necessarily only mean people born after 1997, and may not include many people who were. Inclusive language can help us be clearer when the arbitrary categories we assign to people based on birth year prove inadequate, imprecise, and reductive.\nSupport the author:\nIf you\u2019re enjoying my content, consider showing your support by buying me a coffee.

The piece below reflects my beliefs then that parents should allow our children into the conversation of our pregnancy.\nWhat are your thoughts?\nBy Melissa Uchiyama\nFrom the very start of pregnancy, there are a myriad of decisions to make. No pee stick doles out suggestions on who to tell when. There is no chart. Becoming pregnant while already a parent means another giant decision must be made: when to tell your child that he or she may have a sibling. I say, tell \u2019em. Tell \u2019em when you\u2019re comfortable and don\u2019t let fear get in the way of important, life-changing news that\u2019s yours to tell.\nTelling our kids early-on puts faith in them as thinking and feeling family members. Our family has only positively benefited from including our children in the good news early on, not stifling a sweet thing, pretending I\u2019m only getting rounder from bread rolls, and not an actual baby.\nMy husband and I told both of our children very early on (less than ten weeks) and decided to do all of the growing and many of the discussions together, as a family. No secrets. As a result, both of my children (and now again, as I await the birth of my third) bonded with their siblings in utero, through a myriad of communication and lots of tummy hugs. I also believe telling children, and close friends, early-on is healthy, even if complications later arise. They will have already picked up on grief and may feel confused if not a part of the process. This, to me, is family. This is growing in community and building bonds that will be strong as thick rope vines as the new baby is born and continues to grow.\nOther parents may dismiss their child\u2019s ability to understand there is a growing baby inside. They often wait months, believing that their older children cannot possibility understand abstract time and that which is not instant. I became pregnant within a few weeks of a close friend. She and her husband decided to tell their toddler, who by the way, is very smart, months later, as a Christmas gift, whereas our daughter had already been touching and kissing my growing midsection, discussing her shifting life as a big sister, and learning about the process of growing a baby, for those same months. By the time our new baby was born, the bond was tangible and strong; they were siblings. It took more time, I believe, for our friend\u2019s kids to latch on to their bond.\nAt seven weeks gestation, I couldn\u2019t contain my excitement. It was a maternal adrenaline \u2014 I called my friend outside of a grocery store. She had taken a moment to answer my call while skiing on a mountain and I knew with certainty, as I divulged my news, should my good news turn to heartache, I\u2019d need her same arms reaching through the phone, reaching into helping me cope. For me, I needed to share.\nCertainly, our kids are not our besties we gab to over the phone or over a glass of Merlot. They are our children and we have the job of choosing what and how to edit information so that it is developmentally sound, emotionally appropriate. To be honest, my husband shocked me when he told our daughter at seven weeks. I knew the risks of loss. Even so, we told her and we rejoiced. It\u2019s hard to stifle joy and it\u2019s hard to silence the pain of loss. Kids may see lots of tears at different points-the happy and the sad. I say, with as much uncertainty in the world, let\u2019s choose to show them the joy, never mind the risks. Anything can happen at anytime. If an egg has fertilized and rooted to the walls of a uterus, that is joy. Everything is working, especially if this was an answer to prayer, if the family can picture another squirmy body pulling up to the family table.\nAgain, if the pregnancy does not go as planned, if there is a problem, an abnormality, a heartbeat that later fails, leaving you empty and grieving, your children will be a comfort. They will be part of the overall process of not just a mom\u2019s pain, but a family\u2019s process towards healing. They will need to grieve, perhaps, the loss of a sibling, a brother or sister they could not meet. But those moments with their head on your belly, listening for a heartbeat? Those loving snapshots of big sis rubbing lotion on mom\u2019s belly and those talks about what goes on in the womb? This is the molecular structure of jewels. These will be healing, sweet memories, the times you included them in your joy.\nI say tell them. Tell your kids there is room for one more. Tell them they are important and needed. Tell them you are praying and expecting that strong heartbeat to keep beating and beating until they are in your arms and eating bananas with big sis and later, still, running around. Families share their plans.\nMelissa Uchiyama is an educator, writer, and mother.

It is her first one, the first milk tooth to drop from her mouth. She wiggled it with incessant fascination, so much so, that she got an instant cough, fever, and must wash her hands every few minutes. All the germs that come with wiggling teeth. This is all new.\nHer pink training wheels sit by the front door, wrenched off like another two baby teeth. Not needed. Grown out and flung away. All this growing and that\u2019s hardly the end. This is the tip, the first shoots. My baby girl cannot stay small.\nShe is climbing up like a vine, a summer tendril with beans and new flowers. Another wiggly tooth sits by the other\u2019s hole. Her legs cast off from the hips and she is almost-six going on eight. Amazed at the sharp sides of the tooth and that which couldn\u2019t be seen before, she kept placing it back inside, back in its place. Everything had already changed. That which falls out cannot go back. It\u2019s done being there. In fact, there are already grown-up teeth with ridges.\nI fight to record the growth. Not just hers, but also my son\u2019s. I cannot capture the changes fast enough, cannot devote myself to sitting long enough with paper and pen. It\u2019s easier to nurse with Netflix than to peck one-handedly on a keyboard. The material stacks up. Already like teens, they sour their faces when I again whip out my phone to take a picture or ask them to repeat a phrase so I can pin it verbatim in my notebook. Three out of five times, my son will ruin a shot by sticking out his arm. They want pictures later, the camera away now. They want the evidence, but they want my eyes, my whole body engaged in the present, actively listening, in real time.\nI\u2019ve gotten fast at taking the right shots, so I\u2019m still in conversation. I count it my job to take so many pictures and record short clips with my phone. Parenting frenetic, funny, emotional kids takes effort and momentum. I do not always record quotes, conversations or dramatic essays. Sometimes I am overwhelmed with everything taking place. I wash a few dishes or lay down to nurse, and the time seems to be gone. If I\u2019m not recording, not wildly looting and frantically puling each memory into a case, who, then? Life with kids seems like it\u2019s long, the whole \u201cthe hours are long\u201d, but like the chomp of a gator, it\u2019s quick. Each glimpse into who we are together at this moment could be lost.\nThat\u2019s the challenge and total impetus of this writerly-mothering movement: we want to capture these moments of growth and pain, all the stretching of muscles and mammary glands before it\u2019s over- before we\u2019re lost to the blur. We want to feel each pearl of truth. It is not enough to simply jot down, \u201cJuly 10: no more training wheels\u201d. How big were her eyes when she peddled into the sun? Did she squint in concentration? How about those knuckles and what did she say that sounded proud? I already forget.\nMy infant, the newest person in our clan is two months old, and holds up her neck with the best of them. Her yet-blond lashes double daily and her faculties increase, yet I\u2019ve not even written out her birth. I have not written about those first looks and how she feels in my arms. That weight increases as she takes in my milk. She is already twelve pounds and nearly rolling over. I think I\u2019ll remember the big things, but I already rely on my photos to spark memory. It\u2019s like jumpstarting a car\u2019s battery. That\u2019s the trick about motherhood-no stage seems like it\u2019s leaving until suddenly, it does. You need every member of the family to roll around life with a Go-Pro camera stuck on their heads so at least there\u2019s no want for footage.\nI used to record conversations with my daughter, verbatim, used to keep a notebook of her funny expressions and all of the wonderful words, mispronounced. This new gap in her mouth may change new sounds in her speech as she already corrects the old, endearing ones. \u201cDoor\u201d has been \u201cdoh-ah\u201d and \u201cexcited\u201d, \u201ces-kited\u201d. My son is in that stage of trying out autonomy through knowing my first name. He tries to access my attention, calling out \u201cMoolissa\u201d when \u201cMommy mommy mommy\u201d doesn\u2019t work. He\u2019s perfectly integrated the word \u201cactually\u201d into his everyday lingo. Yet, I have zero remembrance of their first words.\nI mourn the thousands of gorgeous moments undocumented. They are lost. My son, his legs are growing thicker. He stands with his father\u2019s shoulders and back, giggles and speaks with me about how baby popped out and isn\u2019t there anymore. He wants to talk about planes, engines, his baby, favorite teachers, with the language of NOW, of him being three, today, at 4:51. Without sufficient recordings, I will forget the ring and tenure of his voice, loud and then soft.\nTo want to write, to be a writer, though stages of child and mother is both blessed and torture. It is to adore a summer sun and see it fading. To be so busy with the act of loving and the desire to remember every ray of sun as it spreads. Childhood in itself is the act of changing, the seasons of marking time. Maybe writing, then, is the remarkable.\nWe want this, but most days leave us so plumb tuckered-out, we may barely get through the tuck-in story. My husband and I have both knocked our poor kids on their heads with hard-cover books when we\u2019ve fallen asleep, mid-story. Who can journal much or write anything cogent any of these tired days? And suddenly, months have passed. Suddenly, it is time to invite guests to the first and then next birthday parties. Suddenly, teeth sit under a pillow, waiting for you. Time keeps moving; they keep growing and we mothers, we try to keep up. All we can do is snap, capture even a moment of beauty, a whir of beating wings.\nThese fallen teeth, these training wheels sit while I decide what we shall do with them. Treasure? Trash? Leverage to stick under a pillow for money and the promise of something better? It all leads to independence, the kind of run that makes us proud. It also makes us weep. Our babies are gone, pumping legs, splashing hard, teeth under fluffed pillows.\nToday I caught my daughter\u2019s thin limbs peddling, pushing hard round the corner. Those training wheels shall not go back on and that tooth is out for good. Most surprising, perhaps, is the fact that I wrote it down.\nMelissa Uchiyama is an essayist and sometimes poet.

You know, the Celtic singer made famous in the early nineties in the yoga and New Age world. Her \u201cOrinoco Flow\u201d debuted worldwide in 1988; a year that is forever burned within my DNA. I am eight in 1988, waking in my Coral Springs, Florida home. It is Saturday (weekend, sugar cereal time) and my parents are knee-deep in that New Age crowd Enya seems to find herself popular with. We eat Oodles of Noodles, California-style salads, watch The Cosby Show; but we are probably not like too many of the neighbors you\u2019ll find in our cul-de-sac. My parents befriend a woman who boasts in gorgeous Portuguese of her communication with dolphins. Everyone speaks of their personal past-life regression as Inca priests, Pueblo princesses, or secret etchers of Norse runes.\nMy hair hangs from a half-up side ponytail. Enya plays from my dad\u2019s T-top car radio, the Publix supermarket, crystal bookshops, and the coffee shop/bookstore on the corner of Mizner Park in East Boca. Enya\u2019s life-size display stands take over the store, just as I remember a shaggy- haired Yani doing so live at the Acropolis.\nEnya is in LA Story\u2019s soundtrack, and every note of that specific soundtrack, paired with young Sarah Jessica Parker and Steve Martin is the buoyant life I crave as a girl in South Florida \u2014 calm and joyous. 1991 feels innocent still.\nWe south Florida kids dig giant holes at the beach, buy nail polish and earrings at the mall, run errands with our friends and parents in zippy sports cars with ever-present traces of Atlantic Ocean sand falling out of our car doors.\nEnya\u2019s haunting Irish lyricism gets under the skin, making it prickle with the sheer joy of life, like effervescent seltzer, with an ease that chants you to sleep, not unlike water tumbling over stone.\nMy mom is sick in the spring of 1990 after a cerebral hemorrhage, leading to repeated grand mal seizures the next year. More crystal toting friends and New Age yoga music. No wonder I still crave these Enya songs and attainable peace as palpable as her mostly undecipherable lyrics. All of us kids sing, \u201cSay 0-Ay\u201d for her \u201cSail Away.\u201d The point is not precision, but to sail whole out of swirling seas and a family home that crumbles, with a mom who regains walking and talking, relearning phonics and words after her brain bleed. She gradually is well enough to drive again.\nMy dad leaves the marriage in the summer of \u201991. My single mom regains enough, slowly, slowly, to learn every ligament, bone, and muscle in the body, be- coming a licensed massage therapist. She pushes play on the Enya CD as she practices on us. I graduate high school in \u201998. I am working while finding myself, poorly launching into adulthood with the trepidation that can only be matched by Peter Pan. I sell vitamins and organic food until I tire of it after three years, switching instead to leading elementary school groups-tours of St. Augustine. I wear Clinique\u2019s Happy perfume and Petite Sophisticate $28.00 silk scarves around my neck like a chirpy flight attendant. Enya bubbles up with Orinoco Flow in the jingle of shampoo ads. She is everywhere, her sound still dappling through my jazz, punk, gospel, folk, rock, you-name-it influences.\nEvery rainstorm, every passing season and decade, with Enya in the muffled background, is a testament to living. She strikes from out of nowhere, an eerie comfort like pieces of Narnia appearing before you, the Pevensie child you always knew you were.\nIn the angst of teenage-dom, those trickles of Enya on shop sound systems were more than a break in the storm; they were Crystal Light rain showers with the possibility of maintaining a life despite squalls and disappointment, pools where I could stare down at my best self and dare to dive in. I leave America and my immediate family with my new husband for Japan. \u201cWho can say where the road goes\u201d \u2014 I uncover new ground, in and out of clouds. Enya is there when I tailor the music for my first labor and delivery roughly two years after we land in Japan. I am very pregnant and need to know I will be okay in this new country despite midwives who do not understand me and a birth plan that does not include pain killers.\nI add Enya to my Hypno-birth playlist for the first and later, my other two unmedicated, natural child-births. (All took place at a local birth house, not a hospital catering to expats and a wish or expectation for epidurals). She joins my playlist amongst a gambit of others: from She-ra anthems to soft melodies that will lull me into calm. She is my quiet place.\nThe day arrives \u2014 a September day after the steam of summer and the cicadas\u2019 last calls. I breathe.\nShifting at each swerve, I am on a packed train when I realize that I am mere hours from entering life as a new mom outside of her own country. My own mother-in-law was shushed into submission by her mom during labor, who said that making any peep or cry brought shame. I plan on something halfway between prayer and manic trucker-cursing. Midwives print the hours and minutes of my labor, but what is time when each breath feels like a fight for strength?\nI am perhaps an hour (or two?) into labor, a labor that has me bobbing for air like a flummoxed woman of the sea, gulping in air and water. I suddenly focus with a clang \u2014 only one song has been playing \u2014 not my entire playlist, but one, single, damn Enya song, and I can do nothing but breathe through it and wish someone could change it. They are all keyed into me. There is no time.\nI am now twelve years into my Tokyo life, twelve years digging into the life I want while simultaneously missing the life behind me, hours back on Eastern Standard Time.\nEnya chimes in periodically over the seasons. I have three kids now, and news of a new baby who is roughly the size of a plump strawberry. My Enya soundtrack runs through me still, as the world is currently waist-high in the Covid pandemic. Seasons scootch by and every now and then, I hear these songs again.\nWe are saturated by home, by the rhythm of the life we carved out before and now, especially this year, with Covid. Who can say when life will find us and our hearts will choose the far thing, the relationship that spurs us to move over the globe. It is a particularly wild and brave thing to take in our just-born infants\u2019 eyes as they take in their surroundings and first come to trust us with their wellbeing.\nI feel as if I have experienced enough of Enya, but these songs still find me, stirring my heart with the memory of that girl in the bookstore, the one who prayed on nighttime beaches, who flew across continents and sea, salty tresses whipping my eyes. These lyrics still unfold in real-time. I am finding that becoming myself is still good, and this life, with its hiccups, comfort, and pain, still leads to victories that are very real. It all just fits.\nThis fourth baby is a tangerine and then lemon-sized when I write this sentence here, a field of promises expanding inside. I feel hopeful, but worried, fully reliant on ultrasound and exams because it is too soon to feel\nflutters or kicks. The birth house fits me in on December 31st, first thing, through the side door. I take my bike, then two trains, finally walking twenty minutes to hear and see our baby\u2019s heartbeat. I need this before we climb\ninto the New Year. I need the solidity and confidence of the ultrasound printout in my hands before we fly out the next day to warm Okinawa, a prefecture composed of 150 islands between the mainland of Japan and Taiwan.\nI slide into the pleather seat for the ultrasound. \u201cI have bad news.\u201d I paw and scoot backwards. \u201cNo no no no no.\u201d A fallen bird lays in my womb. My doctor touches my hand and directs me to call my husband. My baby is gone.\nI dutifully call. He comes.\nI mewl and sob through the remaining day and night, inconsolable. Wrecked.\nWe return back the following morning, 9 am, to move forward through our grief and pull our child out. Hours of tears, twice fainting with my blood pressure as low as dirt. I flail. I failed to keep our child alive past 13 weeks,\nthough I, myself, thought I was into my 15th week.\nMy husband must leave the room now and I am alone and scared in the same room as my previous three inspired, peaceful kids\u2019 births. Where they were first placed on my chest, where my husband whispered our love to them, where they bathed in a deep sink basin and then donned a cotton cap.\nIn here, now, it is cold and scary. I am moments from sleep as the IV snakes hot meds into my left wrist, preparing to knock me out for the operation. I hear folk and Nick Drake and Carole King. I try to breathe, try to hold on to songs of my youth. My pulse is monitored, but I fear I will simply slip away, too tired to ask, \u201cWill I be okay?\u201d while they tear out my heart and remove all\nsigns of life from my most vulnerable, most cracked and crushed part.\nI re-emerge into awakenness, my husband back at my side. \u201cDo you hear that?\u201d I ask. Wordless, voiceless keyboards are there, nurturing the silence. \u201cIt\u2019s Enya\u201d.\nThis is the first I have ever heard her being played here since my playlist mishap with Enya nonstop, more than ten years ago. Even now in grief, she finds me.\nI cry through showers, want to write My Baby on steamed glass. You were here. I cry and cry, blame the maybe too hot bath or too tight pants I wore. Blame stress. Blame coffee-milk, blame me. I emerge from gloggy, sodden thoughts with each new possible \u201cThis must have happened\u201d scenario.\nWe decide to leave for Okinawa, still, later, on January 4th. It is not all sun, but cold, grey rain.\nI cook for our friends while she drives her kids to soccer practice. After days of being served and soothed at our home in Tokyo, here I am, making two trays of lasagna. I should not be, maybe, but it is upon me to chiffonade spinach, layer on starchy pasta, garlic spinach, and fragrant bunches of basil. It is on me to comfort myself, it seems, with the act of layering lasagna. Before this trip, I barely go without tears for two hours, but here I am cooking a meal for two families. I am the one stretching out sauce with splashes of chicken broth and olive oil, checking a pantry I have never used, to feed hungry children. Somehow, I still can provide and later, the kids and adults declare it the best lasagna ever.\nI slink off to a quiet room following dinner and think of my baby, my littlest one. I need comfort at every moment \u2014 especially in sleeping and waking, every hour, needing a visceral shield of hugs to fight blame and grief.\nI need cups and cups of hot tea, thick socks, and voices sweeter and louder telling me the truth and the pain of what happened. I need warm water sloshing softly as I lie on a raft, not unlike the peace I felt when giving birth.\nI am ready to be found again and again by every song. The cold and wet continues, not the tropical Okinawa I expected as a rescue balm. Water makes every leaf lush, though. There are two servings of lasagna left and the songs that weave through me.\nWho can say where the time goes, only time. The memory of each seed stays in soil. I am living, changed by the remembrance. I am fashioned to pull life and sustenance out of heat.\nMy omiyage/souvenirs to bring back from our week in Okinawa is a glass I made, rotating left and right hands as I blow my breath through a metal pipe. I sit with the guide, a young Japanese guy who steers me in making the lip of the glass. It will be pink with a burst of colors, life in and out of fire, spun into a fixed form. I want to pull my child, this baby who could not continue to grow, into my hands here. I want to guide my breath right, giving every chance of air aimed like a spear.\nI want a do-over, but what I have is memory. The knowledge that I wanted this baby, loved it from the first splitting of cells. Only ash, not a form to hold.\nI pick up my glass the next day. It is not what I thought I made. It is a childish thing, just polka-dots of green, purple, and yellow.\nI don\u2019t want this thing. I\u2019d rather the fire and the chance to make it over again, the same one, only more real. If only I had more time, to stand right there with it, my boots hot, hands blistering. If only I had more of whatever knowledge one needs to blow glass or make diamonds.\nWho can say if your love grows as your heart chose,\nonly time.\nThe heart is a wondrous, capsized thing that\nremembers every tune of sorrow, every sweet, little\nravenous beat.", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 19, "created_time": 1644132053870, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Enya", "Miscarriage", "Loss", "Grief", "Pregnancy And Childbirth"]}, {"author": "Kate Verity", "post_id": "86445cf80531", "user_id": "b0bcd57e95cb", "title": "The Lasting Impact of Growing Up With A Suicidal Parent", "content": "The Lasting Impact of Growing Up With A Suicidal Parent\nWhere do you go when home isn\u2019t safe anymore?\nPhoto by Vince Fleming on Unsplash\nTrigger warning: This essay talks about suicide, attempted suicide, and self harm. Please honor your boundaries and proceed with caution.\nThere are things that you\u2019re not supposed to talk about.\nThings that under no circumstances leave this house, do you understand?\nIt never even needed to be said. You just knew, without needing to be told, that no one would love you if you told your shame-filled story. That your parents would feel betrayed because you don\u2019t air your dirty laundry out in public. That there was no help for you, no matter how much pain you held unconsciously in your eyes.\nThis was just how life was, and someone always had it worse than you did anyway.\nI remember trying to reach out for help just once, in a particularly desperate moment after my mother\u2019s third (and most traumatic) wayward suicide attempt. I told my friend in hushed voices what had happened when we were alone in the computer lab, and this poor, overwhelmed, totally unprepared girl looked to the side\u2026and she changed the subject.\nAnd honestly, I can\u2019t even blame her. This 16-year-old did not have the tools to handle what I was telling her or to help me in any meaningful way. But her reaction to my confession confirmed any reservations I had about sharing what happened at home.\nThere would be no help for me, and I was absolutely on my own.\nShame needs three things to grow exponentially in our lives: secrecy, silence, and judgment. (Brene Brown)\nTrauma is a generational gift that runs through both sides of my family. My mother was specifically dealt a really shitty hand and survived an abominable childhood terrorized by her mother. She ran away at 16 and moved to the other side of the state, where she met and fell in love with my father. By 18, she was pregnant with me. By 19, she was married.\nWhat followed could really be considered a utilitarian childhood. I\u2019m sure there was love, but I don\u2019t remember a lot of warmth in my home. Just like I know we were materially taken care of, but I remember feeling scarcity like a cold knife running down my back. We weren\u2019t poor but we lived poor and made up for it with appearances \u2014 the perfect picture of a nice, normal middle-class family.\nWe stretched and strained to fit this illusion and it worked for a while. My father worked full time and my mother became the perfect housewife, the T-ball coach, the Girl Scout troop leader, the ideal 90s mother. But here\u2019s the thing about buried trauma \u2014 just because you\u2019ve put it in a box and packed it away in the back of your mind doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s gone. It sits there, growing and rotting and leaking until it takes a header into your life and decides it won\u2019t be ignored anymore.\nMy mother had no close friends or family, and my father had the emotional maturity of a heavily armed five year old. By the time she started seeing a psychiatrist, she\u2019d been cutting for years to give an outlet to this intense emotional pain roaring inside her. She tried antidepressants for a while, but it didn\u2019t take.\nAnd pretty soon she started to drink heavily, and began fading away.\nAn unacknowledged trauma is like a wound that never heals over and may start bleeding again at any time. (Alice Miller)\nThe first time my mother tried to kill herself, I was half way through junior high school. The memory of that night is burned into my brain in technicolor, the tiniest details given intense attention.\nThe flashing police lights through my frilly, white curtains; seeing her passed out on the chair (again) but this time with police and EMTs around her; being taken to a friend\u2019s house in the middle of the night to sleep on their couch, terrified of what happened but with no answers and no one to hold me and tell me that she\u2019d be fine, everything would be fine, and it was okay to cry.\nMy father, who could not process or handle his own emotions, gave us a stilted explanation the next morning when he picked us up \u2014 took some pills, stomach pumped, staying overnight. I don\u2019t remember talking about it after, and we certainly never discussed our emotions, goodness no. Best just to carry on as if it never happened. We welcomed her home later with open arms, happiness and fear closely intertwined.\nThe second time she tried to kill herself was two years later, after she\u2019d moved to an apartment in town but before my parents were officially divorced. I was on the periphery of this one \u2014 that is, until my father took me to her apartment, where I got to see the scattered remains of the nights events and a front door with a missing doorknob.\nHe wasn\u2019t shy about telling me what had happened, having mistook me for a fourteen-year-old therapist and co-conspirator instead of a daughter with mentally ill parents who was trying not to drown.\nThe third time, there was no sideline for me. I was sixteen, a junior in high school, on an every-other-weekend visit to my mother\u2019s house with my younger sister. I remember the medical bill that kicked off the spiral and sent her to her bedroom crying.\nI left my sister in front of the TV while I joined my mother, the smell of marijuana heavy as she told me she couldn\u2019t do this anymore and didn\u2019t want to live. She read me poetry that she had written when she was a teenager, quiet, romantic sonnets about love and hope and loss. She gave me her PIN number and told me how to access her funds at the bank.\nShe told me which rings she wanted which person to have after she was gone. I was locked in to this confusing, intimate moment with my mother, wanting to prolong it, unsure of how to stop it or what to say, afraid to move, afraid to breathe. Objections died on my lips before they even left my mouth, and I was left with confusing feelings of terror and apathy. And then she got into her car and drove away.\nI don\u2019t remember much about what happened after, only that I was on her bedroom floor sobbing with the door closed, not wanting to scare my little sister, and somehow managed to call my father to come pick us up, because our mother just drove away to kill herself.\nWhen he pulled into her driveway an hour later, the phone rang. It was my mother \u2014 she was less than a mile down the road hanging out at her friend\u2019s house, and was finally calling to let me know she was still alive.\nAnd she always had a way with her brokenness. She would take her pieces and make them beautiful. (R.M. Drake)\nI look back on these milestones of trauma now with a certain solemnity and a clearer understanding how each of them hammered me into a new shape \u2014 at first a harsher, more cynical version of myself and later, softened with time and reflection, someone who can find compassion and lessons in moments of breathtaking pain.\nThese weren\u2019t the first events that robbed me of my childlike ideal of the world being a safe and welcoming place. But they did set off cycles of hypervigilance, distrust, and dysfunction where love and fear became so intertwined that for the longest time, I didn\u2019t know how to have one without the other and still feel like I was on solid ground. It is with years of therapy and self-reflection that I have finally began to mend the broken pieces back together.\nThey also permanently damaged my relationship with my mother, something we only came close to recovering after she was diagnosed with small-cell lung cancer. She had stopped cutting and as far as I know, had never tried to commit suicide after those events, but she continued to self-medicate with alcohol, cigarettes, and other medicinal crutches until the very end of her life.\nWhen my mother died of cancer in 2020, I received the most beautiful messages from family and friends, some of which had known her when we were growing up. They remembered her as a Girl Scout leader and a T-ball coach, someone who chaperoned school field trips and talked about there being a woman president someday. They honestly took me completely by surprise, both with their wholehearted compassion for my loss, and that they remembered someone who I\u2019d honestly forgotten had ever existed.\nI think that has been the most challenging part of recovery for me \u2014 seeing her as a whole person instead of hyperfocusing on the things she did that caused me pain. Because yes, she was self-destructive and narcissistic, but she was also someone who didn\u2019t know how to handle the enormous amount of emotional pain she felt, and whose children got caught up in the fallout when she could no longer contain the madness inside her.\nThere is a dichotomy to these experiences that has become a cornerstone of understanding my trauma \u2014 that my mother did the best she could with the tools that she had available to her, and that her tools were not enough to protect her children from being traumatized.\nIt\u2019s one of the reasons I\u2019ve read intensively about trauma and have spent a good amount of time in therapy\u2014I want to break this generational cycle so that my daughter and her children don\u2019t have the same experiences as past generations.

They started popping up at craft shops and grocery stores almost overnight. I remember a group of women at my work that would get together during their lunch breaks to color, books and pencils in hand as they chatted and filled in gardens and mandalas.\nEven though coloring has been around forever, it wasn\u2019t until 2015 that the popularity of adult coloring books really exploded. In the last few years, coloring books have been hailed as being therapeutic without being therapy, and giving readers hours of \u201czen-like stress relief.\u201d Coloring books are also now a booming business \u2014 sales went from 1 million books sold in 2014 to a whopping 12 million in 2015.\nSo I decided to finally get one of my own to see what all the fuss was about. I purchased my first coloring book, which promised to color my stress away, and a brand new set of markers. When I pulled them out for the first time, I fully expected a meditative relaxation to take hold of me while I lost myself in filling in the small segments of the pattern.\nThat is not at all what happened.\nAs I picked up my marker and began to color, I felt my jaw clench and shoulders tighten until they were near to my ears. I strained to keep my markers within the lines, my anxiety rising as I neared the edges and I found myself holding my breath for fear of crossing the line and ruining my work.\nWhen I went to grab my next color, my anxiety went even higher as I started to overthink which color to pick next \u2014 what should the color palette be? would these colors go? what if the shade was off? I wish I\u2019d have picked a different shade of green \u2014 and by the time I put the book down, my entire body was tight with stress and I was a giant ball of anxiety.\nThis cannot be what zen-like relaxation feels like.\nWhat in the world just happened?\nThe internet is chock full of advice on how to relieve stress, and I\u2019ve read a good chunk of it on my healing journey. Everything from essential oils and exercise to juice cleanses and Himalayan salt lamps, there are a thousand and one solutions that are guaranteed to loosen your shoulders and make your insides glow with the rays of a thousand shining suns.\nNot to mention rainbows flying out of your\u2026\nWell, let's not get sidetracked.\nNow, I\u2019m not saying that these things don\u2019t work for anyone. The problem with mass-marketed stress relievers is that their marketing plan often hinges on getting the largest audience possible \u2014 that is, throwing the biggest net to see who they can catch. And if they price their miracle solution just right, you can almost always talk yourself into giving it a try.\nUnfortunately, trial and error is largely how you find what\u2019s right for you. The key to trial and error though is figuring out why a certain solution didn\u2019t work for you.\nThis is where we have a breakdown.\nI\u2019m guilty of it too, 1000%. I try a solution, it doesn\u2019t work, and I dismiss it without stopping to consider why it didn\u2019t work. A few weeks/months/years later, I have the same problem and I try a similar solution, with similarly disappointing results.\nCase in point \u2014 coloring books. After I bought my first coloring book and was decidedly NOT relieved of my stress, I figured maybe it was the artistic medium\u2026so I bought colored pencils. When that didn\u2019t work, I got a few new coloring books thinking maybe it was the pattern that was causing me to tighten up. But nothing worked.\nSo why was that?\nIt was because my anxiety is based on control.\nI\u2019m a recovering perfectionist and people pleaser who had extremely critical parents growing up. I have a large amount of shame associated with not meeting my own and other people\u2019s expectations of perfection, to the point where I have a hard time trying new things if I think I might not be great at them.\nI know all of this because I\u2019m eyeballs deep in inner work at the moment.\nAnd yet \u2014 I bought myself coloring books and accidentally triggered a shame spiral.\nIt\u2019s one of those connections I don\u2019t think you can make in the moment, to be honest. It didn\u2019t occur to me until years after I\u2019d bought my first book that I\u2019d accidentally pushed on something that was very raw inside me.\nSo while coloring books may be a good therapeutic tool to work on getting comfortable with imperfection, they were not the stress relief tool I was looking for.\nWhat Actually Helped Me Lower My Stress\nI\u2019ve tried a lot of things on my healing journey to find the right combination of self-care tools for someone with my anxiety type. After some trial and error, I found these ones had the most long-term benefit.\nChanging my diet: I had to make some drastic changes to my diet a few years ago due to an autoimmune disease, and one of the interesting things that came to light was how much certain foods raised the feeling of stress in my body. I\u2019m talking specifically about gluten, caffeine, and sugar. In fact, if I eat processed carbs regularly, I start getting heart palpitations. You really are what you eat.\nWalking Outside: I\u2019m not here to tell you exercise is important because everyone knows that. But what I will say is that if I don\u2019t go for my short morning walk (20 minutes) for a couple of days, I can feel it in my body and my temperament. After the pandemic started, I also took up hiking which has the added benefit of being surrounded by nature and is especially relaxing, when done solo.\nYin Yoga: This is not your normal yoga class. Yin yoga is putting your body into a beautiful shape and then relaxing to let your body gently stretch and release. It\u2019s all about letting go while being present in your body and has helped me release a lot of stuck energy. It\u2019s also taken the place of meditation, with which I\u2019ve always had a love/hate relationship.\nComedy: I\u2019m very mindful about the television I watch and the music I listen to, as these can have a big impact on my mood and mental health. I\u2019ve always heard laughter is the best medicine, and I can confirm that putting on a comedian works wonders for distracting and turning around my mood. Extra points for Mike Birbiglia and Marc Maron \u2014 I\u2019ve fallen asleep to their comedy shows more than a few times in the last year.\nCBT: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, or CBT, is a form of talk therapy that works on identifying and deconstructing damaging core beliefs we hold about ourselves and the world around us. By challenging how your mind thinks about things, you can change what stresses you out and how you hold it in your body. It\u2019s more structured than regular talk therapy and for me, was an absolute game changer.\nYou can never eliminate stress entirely, you can only learn how to keep it at a manageable level so that it isn\u2019t left unchecked. Even though coloring didn\u2019t work for me, I learned something about myself when I finally figured out why. And I also found a pretty great set of tools that work for my body and mind.\nSo wherever you are in your healing journey, I hope you can find your own tools to fill your toolbox with.

Our other cat, nearly eight years old, loved being an \u201conly child\u201d and flourished in our single cat household. It made it easy to decide to forego a new cat companion, and with the loss still sharp and fresh, I honestly wasn\u2019t ready anyway. As I wrestled with this loss, I was also helping my mother fight stage four lung cancer\u200a\u2014 at least until the COVID pandemic hit and her health took an abrupt turn for the worse.\nAnd all of a sudden, she was moving into a Hospice care facility and my sister and I were dividing her two cats between our homes. She took Q, and I took Lady Grace.\nSome things to know about Lady Grace (aside from the outrageously aristocratic name): she was 18 years old, white with gray patches, and as tiny as a kitten at less than six pounds. My mother had owned both her parents and had been with her since the day she was born. Years ago, when it was an intangible commitment, my mother had made me promise to take Grace should anything happen to her. And like most promises you think you won\u2019t have to actually go through with, I easily agreed.\nGrace arrived at our home with a yellow tinge to her fur and smelled like residual smoke, which honesty, I\u2019d expected\u200a\u2014 she\u2019d been living with a smoker her entire life. I hadn\u2019t realized her eyes were also cloudy with smoke until they started to clear after a few weeks of living with us.\nAs she aged, Grace had become hyperthyroid and progressively deaf, which led to absolutely no volume modulation when she meowed and caterwauled from the top of our stairs, the sound echoing off the hardwood floors. She was extremely resonant, like an 80s hair band singer, and was often mistaken for a crying baby on Zoom calls. Her hyperthyroidism was being treated with an herbal remedy off of Amazon that did nothing for her thyroid levels. She was frantic, drinking water constantly, caterwauling from room to room, constantly unsettled. It also became clear that she wasn\u2019t used to being fed regularly. I remember Grace begging for scraps at the dinner table when we first got her, and meowing at top volume during feeding time, panicked and alert even as we were dishing out the food.\nWhat I hadn\u2019t realized when we took Grace in was how bad she\u2019d been neglected. My mother loved her cats\u200a\u2014 more than she\u2019d loved her own children\u200a\u2014 and I\u2019d assumed that love had meant good care. And it might have, at one point. But as I took care of this cat, I thought about how chaotic my mom could be, how loving her felt like a trial by fire, and how I\u2019d watched her spiral into self destruction. And how after being diagnosed with cancer, my mother insisted that she continue to live alone and fought tooth and nail to stay out of nursing homes, even while her mental state deteriorated.\nI remember talking with my mother after she moved into Hospice House and how she would plead with me to bring Grace in for a visit. Just sneak her in, so she could see her and pet her and love her. My heart broke every time I had to tell her no\u200a\u2014\u200ano, there are rules in Hospice House and no, I can\u2019t re-traumatize a cat like that. I took pictures of cute, tiny Grace and sent them to my mother, hoping that if she saw her being taken care of, maybe it would ease her mind. And it seemed to, for a while. And then she didn\u2019t seem to care about pictures or phones or anything at all.\nShe finally passed away in June after two months in Hospice care. She was 56.\nImage credit: Author\nIn the wake of my mother\u2019s passing, Grace began a slow healing of her own that I only recognized in retrospect. It took a few weeks before her fur started showing up white and her eyes cleared up. When the caterwauling was too much to take, we took her to the vet and found out that her thyroid levels were way out of range; we promptly started her on some actual medication and little cat slowly started to stabilize. We found out that she also had early stage kidney disease, so we switched her to canned food and mixed in some pumpkin and water.\nWith all these changes, this little cat began to thrive. She calmed down and stopped caterwauling. She started trusting that she would be regularly fed, and cuddled between our pillows at night. She\u2019d make mad dashes down the hallway in unexpected bouts of playfulness. She walked around with her hind legs jaunting like John Wayne and still announced herself when she walked into a room, but it was now at a slightly quieter volume. She also became a notorious plastic muncher and never let us sleep through the night, but we admired her grit and resilience. She was the living, breathing, cat version of Betty White, and as she kept going and going, I half-wondered if she\u2019d outlive us.\nSometimes when I stroked her white, furry chin, I wondered if she misses my mother. Or if she missed her like I missed her\u200a\u2014\u200agrief and sadness with a tinge of relief. I got to grow up and leave her chaotic presence, but this cat\u2026this cat had probably seen some shit. I remember my mother complaining about how loud Grace was and how constant her nagging had been. And how the nagging I\u2019d experienced went away as soon as I provided her with consistent care, feeding, and responsiveness. My mother loved her, yes, but she loved her because Grace\u2019s love was unconditional. As soon as she had needs and wants, she became a nuisance, something to push away.\nI guess maybe we\u2019d both seen some shit.\nImage credit: Author\nJust as gently as she healed, Grace began her decline.\nI\u2019ve only ever had to put one pet down, and when the time came, I struggled with it. How do you decide when your pet needs to die? When is the cost of continuing to live greater than helping them gently into the night? With my mother, I\u2019d watched her cling to life and struggle to the bitter end, when a gentle escape would have been more of a mercy than watching her slowly fade away.\nIn the end, he told me it was time. After weeks of laying on me and nursing me through my concussion and my grandmother\u2019s death, he decided that he\u2019d had enough. His back legs got weak and he stopped eating, stopped cleaning himself. He just curled up and knew. And still it was agonizing.\nBut this one. This one is different. This is a cat I never wanted but still ended up loving. She was 19 and a half, and she was the last living thing I had left of my mother. And yet somehow, in the last year and a half Grace had also made herself mine.\nWhen her back legs started giving out, we knew we were close and started mentally preparing my daughter and ourselves for what was coming. After using a stepping stool for a while, we ended up having to lift her to get in her favorite spot on the bed. Her appetite kept going but she slowed way down, seeming only to sleep and hobble to the bowl and cat box. At night, she started sitting so close to my face that she would boop my nose on accident and startle me awake, or would meow softly in my ear (even now, I\u2019m not sure why). I think she could feel a shift, and I tried to comfort her as best I could.\nI still ended up Googling \u201cHow do you know when it\u2019s time to put your cat down\u201d. Because I knew it was time, but it felt like I was saying goodbye to two things now instead of just one and I didn\u2019t know if I was ready, even when I knew it wasn\u2019t about me. When she started dragging her back legs behind her as she walked to the food bowl, I knew it would be selfish to wait any longer.\nBecause of COVID, we set up outside the vet clinic on a picnic table overlooking the garden and wandering chickens. I held her to my chest, tears streaming down my face, and pet her gently as the cool breeze ruffled her fur and she slowly calmed. She cuddled with my arm when I placed her on the table, stroking the spot on her chin that she loved so much. And then we said goodbye.\nThe house is quieter now, more relaxed. My cat, now nine and a half, is enjoying being an only cat once again. We joke about finally getting a full nights sleep, a half-truth laced with sadness and no small amount of relief. I talk about love and grief with my daughter, who is wrestling yet again with some very big emotions.\nAnd even though I know Grace is gone, sometimes I still see her curled between our pillows during the day, and feel her resting beside my head at night.\nI wonder how long that will last, and if I\u2019ll be sad when I notice it\u2019s stopped.\nIn my mother\u2019s final months, she asked me to have Grace cremated with her when the time came so they could be together. Grace ended up outliving her by a year and a half, so I couldn\u2019t do what she asked of me at the time. But I did end up getting Grace cremated.\nWhen the weather warms and the ground thaws and the birds start chirping again, I\u2019ll take them for a walk and sprinkle their ashes together in the forest.\nI think they both would have liked that.", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 0, "created_time": 1634741852096, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Grief", "Loss", "Family", "Death", "Life"]}, {"author": "Sudan Aryal", "post_id": "a52096ef245a", "user_id": "35dc2b607dab", "title": "Homo Economicus: What\u2019s Wrong with the Rational Economic Man?", "content": "Homo Economicus: What\u2019s Wrong with the Rational Economic Man?\nClassical physics offered more to economic modeling than any other field of natural science \u2014 is quantum physics the future?\n\n\u201cOrthodoxy means not thinking- not needing to think. Orthodoxy is unconsciousness.\u201d\n-George Orwell, Nineteen Eighty-four (1949)\nSuppose you were offered to make a choice between two bets: bet A gives you a 9/10 chance of winning $10, while bet B has a 1/10 chance of winning $100. Which one of the mentioned two deals would you prefer?\nSuch scenarios, whereby individuals are required to make choices in the face of uncertainty are not rare. On the contrary, such decision-making extends from the way we choose to pick stocks with varying levels of risk and return in the stock market, to the way we choose what beverage to drink in a bar. Being an issue with such far-reaching implications, it lies therefore at the heart of economic thought, whose primary aim is to analyze the way we make decisions, both individually and collectively, in the face of scarcity.\nIn order to explain how individuals and societies make choices, the concept \u2018homo economicus\u2019, the rational economic man, was introduced by classical economists as an abstraction of actual individuals. As Smith famously quoted in his classic work The Wealth of Nations: \u201cIt is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own self-interest.\u201d The sole function of the rational economic man in the economy was to seek efficiency in maximizing their self-interest.\nNewtonian physics and classic economics\nThis efficiency maximizing abstraction of individuals made by Classical economists owes much gratitude to the Newtonian physicists of the era and their realization of the phenomenon of diffraction of light through a glass prism, whereby individual photons of light would take the most efficient path. Newton\u2019s contemporary, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, explained the idea by comparing God to an architect \u201cwho utilizes his location and the funds destined for the building in the most advantageous manner.\u201d\nRepresenting societal individuals as Newtonian particles enabled classical economists to make Newtonian calculations about how prices would be set in a market economy, or to arrive at what William Stanley Jevons called a \u201cmechanics of self-interest and utility.\u201d\nAccording to classical economists, the decision-making of our rational economic man in the face of uncertainty would be explained by what is called the expected utility theory, whereby the economic agent would pursue his aim of self-interest maximization, and choose the deal that would maximize his/her expected utility. The expected utility of each deal was to be calculated by multiplying the likelihood of occurrence with the value of the outcome to the individual, and whichever deals provided the greatest expected utility to the individual, that deal was to be pursued. Therefore, according to this theory, individuals would choose Bet B (1/10*100=$10) over Bet A (9/10*10=$9), in order to maximize their expected utility.\nHowever, a similar game conducted in an experimental setting by Tversky and Thaler in 1990, provided circumstantial results, whereby individuals would not follow the path prescribed by the classical economists and always prefer the bet which provided the maximum expected utility. The choices made by actual individuals, it turns out, were highly influenced by the situation they were in. If the person was playing the game themselves, then 71% of the participants preferred to go with Bet A, because of their dislike for the uncertainty of outcomes that affected their self-interest. On the other hand, if their job was to price the game for someone else, they suddenly turned on their calculators, with 67% correctly considering Bet B as more valuable.\nSuch a reversal in preference can be more clearly recognized if you ask a cigarette smoker to rank his/her utility of smoking and quitting. People trying to quit smoking will rank the utility of not smoking in the future higher than that of smoking (which is why they are trying to quit). However, if asked to rank the utility of actually stopping smoking right now, they often prefer to reverse their preferences and pull out a cigarette, in defiance of classical economic logic.\nErrors in the fundamental theory\nNow, the key role of economic science in modern society has far-reaching implications, and fundamental classical economic principles such as the expected utility theory lie a priori on theories of management, finance, and commerce. Therefore, errors in fundamental economic theories such as that of the expected utility theory (clearly been pointed out in the field of Behavioural Economics by Kahneman and Tversky in their famous work Thinking Fast and Slow) has far-reaching consequences to several other related fields of social science.\nIn defense of their classical logic, economists do seem to consider such results as a consequence of \u2018irrational\u2019 behavior and simply rule them out, even mocking Behavioural Economics considering it to be \u201cpsychology of stupidity\u201d which makes no sense to the realm of pure economic thought. However, they remain silent about the consequences of their errors such as what happened in the financial crises of 2008/09.\nThe key error in part of classical economic logic as concluded by behavioral economists lies in their unrealistic assumption of \u2018homo economicus\u2019, and thus due to the vast differences in the behavior of conscious individuals with that of Newtonian particles that obeyed mechanical laws. However, this in no way would imply that physics should have no partake in explaining economic phenomena, in fact, physics has offered more to economic modeling than any other field of natural science. The problem with Economics here lies in the accepted orthodoxy about the hard-to-swallow assumptions unchanged since the Newtonian era, and in its failure to adapt to the rapid evolution that our knowledge of physical phenomena has undergone.\nWelcoming the quantum age\nQuantum physics offers an elegant explanation of the phenomena, with a great deal of relevance to economic thought and the concept of homo economicus. The errors in economic principles that are mainly due to the false assumption of the rational economic man, can be resolved using quantum logic. The fundamental difference between classical and quantum logic lies in the fact that the first allows only for Aristotelian or binary distinction, while quantum logic sees a system as being in a superposition of multiple states, which snaps down to a single answer only at the time of measurement.\nWe are less like Newtonian particles fixating our preferences based on a mechanical law, and more like Schrodinger\u2019s cat existing in more than one state at the same time, at least until we need to make a choice.\nTo explain what this has to do with our concept of a rational economic man, it makes sense only from a classical logic point of view to speak about the fixed linear preferences of a rational economic man, while in the context of quantum logic, such an approach stops making sense. Preferences of individuals are described by a time-varying probabilistic function that is sensitive to both measurement and context. Our preferences seem to lack a hard and fast rule, and change according to spatial-temporal circumstances.\nFor example, we might usually prefer red wine with a meal, but we can occasionally choose white or rose depending on the exact situation. We are less like Newtonian particles fixating our preferences based on a mechanical law, and more like Schrodinger\u2019s cat existing in more than one state at the same time, at least until we need to make a choice.\nQuantum formalism of economic phenomena is ideally suited for handling situations where consumer behavior depends on infinitely many factors and that the consumer is not aware of any preference until the matter is brought up. Applying quantum decision theory to such cases makes it possible to explain the counterintuitive results of the fore-mentioned experiment by complementing the utility function with another attraction function that describes sub-conscious preferences, such as risk-aversion, and their quantum interference with the uncertain prospects, which classical Economics fails to account for.\nThe real problem with economics, I believe lies in its orthodoxy, and not in its derivation of principles from the realm of physical thought. On the contrary, the realm of quantum physics has to offer much more to the realm of Economics in the contemporary era, and thus, to enable contemporary economists to explain the behavioral aspects of economic agents in modern society.", "comment_count": 8, "like_count": 115, "created_time": 1643904497920, "comment": [{"user_id": "35dc2b607dab", "comment_time": 1643904497920, "comment": "Homo Economicus: What\u2019s Wrong with the Rational Economic Man?"}, {"user_id": "802456ecb138", "comment_time": 1645362017068, "comment": "Capitalism is immoral.

No, these students were in my class several years ago. My kids. Any teacher will tell you that this is how it works.\nWhen a student comes into my classroom, I tell them they have a lifetime warranty on their experience as my student. Struggling in college? Call. Need a reference? Email. Want to meet up for an in-person pep-talk? Text.\nMany do.\nI\u2019ve attended college graduations and weddings and baby showers and birthday parties to celebrate them. I\u2019ve held their brand new babies. I\u2019ve let toddlers waddle across the colored tiles in my classroom as their parents fill me in on their adult lives. I\u2019ve met them for brunches, lunches, dinners, and coffees. I\u2019ve scheduled their appointments with therapists and talked them through post-college crises.\nI tell them to call. Many do.\nThe ones who don\u2019t are the ones who linger in my mind. They\u2019re the ones I wonder about on some random cloudy afternoon as I drive down Interstate 5, my mind wandering to the crystal-clear centers of otherwise foggy memories: the stickers they carefully arranged on their water bottle or the playfully doodled notes they left on their assignments or the tears they shed as they sat in my classroom and cried over a break-up.\nIn sixteen years of teaching, I have yet to be able to convey the depth of the care I feel for my students. Every day they sit in front of me, vulnerable in their roles as learners, trusting me to guide them in a manner that will make them feel valued and capable. It\u2019s the greatest responsibility of my life.\nI just wish they knew.\nI wish they knew that I root for them as I grade their essays.\nI wish they knew that I see their pain on a bad day, the pain they try to hide behind a hoodie, and I cross my fingers, hoping that the next time I see them, the hood will be down and the smile will be back.\nI wish they knew that I see them vying for acceptance every day, earnestness sparking quietly in their eyes, even as they work so heartbreakingly hard to make it seem like they don\u2019t care what anyone else thinks.\nI wish they knew how often they make me laugh \u2014 even when I have to hide it.\nI wish they knew just how much they\u2019re capable of accomplishing \u2014 especially when they have resigned themselves to the fate of being \u201cbad\u201d in school.\nI wish they knew how much I love the notes they leave for me \u2014 on assignments, on the whiteboard, and on post-its. The crooked smiley faces and the silly jokes are fuel for another day.\nI wish they knew that I carry their successes and failures with me long after the final bell of the day.\nI wish they knew that I cross my fingers and toes for them on graduation day. That I hope post-high school life is everything they hope it will be and more. That if I could pave the road they\u2019re about to travel to glass-like smoothness, I would. But I can\u2019t and I know it\u2019s for the best.\nI wish my students knew how much I think about them after they leave me. I wish they knew how proud I am when they become mothers, fathers, teachers, nurses, lawyers, mechanics, firefighters, baristas, artists, welders, problem-solvers, soul-searchers, world-travelers, or whatever it is that fills them with a sense of their own tremendous worth.\nI try to tell them these things\u2014 explicitly first \u2014 and then through my actions. I talk to them every single day. I try to cultivate silly little inside jokes with them. I tell them I\u2019m glad they\u2019ve come to class \u2014 even when they\u2019re 30 minutes late. I invite them to stay after school if they need help \u2014 or just a quiet place to work. I encourage them to join the clubs I advise, and I tell them I miss them on the days that they\u2019re gone.\nI lost two students last month. Gone forever. Two truncated sentences in what should have been two full-length stories of vivacity and accomplishment.\nI can\u2019t help but wonder if they knew the richness they added to my life.\nI hope they did.", "comment_count": 37, "like_count": 2763, "created_time": 1633302379257, "comment": [{"user_id": "23a4307290a3", "comment_time": 1633302379257, "comment": "Thank you for sharing!"}, {"user_id": "141726aaf458", "comment_time": 1637456318568, "comment": "The teachers like you are the ones I\u2019ve thought a lot about since HS, the ones with a positive impact, the ones who cared enough to give it their all.

The birds chirp ceaselessly, safely zipping and whirling from branch to branch darting through pinkish puffs of almond blossoms. Chickens trot comically around the stable yard, pecking persistently for any remnants of scratch. A horse whinnies somewhere in the distance and another responds from the opposite direction, both greetings carried by the breeze. The smell is, well\u2026pungent. But you adapt \u2014 first becoming used to it and then becoming fond of it.\nIt makes no sense. Nobody in my family had ever had any sort of interest in or proximity to horses, and I was an unusually timid child, so my fixation with these flighty prey animals seemed incongruous. I never really played with Barbie much, but I did play with her dream horses, grooming them and setting up horse shows without ever having seen one in real life.\nIf ever there was a petting zoo or a pony ride \u2014 anything that involved a horse, my parents were forking over the cash for me to participate. On one memorable occasion in the third grade, a classmate brought her quarter horse to school for show-and-tell, and we each had the chance to pet its neck. I still remember the trance-like state I fell into as I let my fingers drag reverently over the velvety sinew.\nIt took years of begging for my parents to relent, but they eventually acquiesced to my repeated requests for riding lessons. I can still remember a trip to the local feed store where I picked a pair of black Justin roper boots. A family friend spotted us and remarked with a vague sort of fondness, \u201cGirls and their horses. Such a wonderful phase.\u201d\nThat was 27 years ago.\nHorses were simultaneously the most humbling and the most empowering creatures I had ever encountered. This is still the case.\nBut it all started with a scrappy little Appaloosa.\nMy first horse was a rental. My family paid $40 a month for the privilege of calling him ours twice a week. His name was Aslan, he was an ancient Appaloosa gelding, and he had one eye.\nYes, I rode a one-eyed horse.\nNo, that\u2019s not a euphemism.\nAslan (Image from the author\u2019s library)\nAslan\u2019s eye had been surgically removed to stave off the painful effects of a progressive eye disease, and he had been donated to my instructor \u2014 resigned to a life of teaching gawky beginners what not to do in the saddle. A saint in horse form.\nThe first time I saw him, I thought he was magnificent. A white steed worthy of every fairy tale I had ever read. My untrained eye didn\u2019t see all of the flaws that would label him a conformational disaster by any legitimate measure of quality horseflesh. His mottled coat, thick neck, bottle-brush tail, and roached (shaved) mane, were hardly reminiscent of the Barbie dream horses I had come to know, but this was of little concern to me.\nHe was a real horse.\nAslan was the equine equivalent to a jaunty Scotty dog, trotting along at a cheerful clip, his ears perked, empty eye socket blinking away. He was a seasoned pro \u2014 ancient for as long as I knew him \u2014 and he taught countless children to ride through his carefully devised system of genuine laziness and halfhearted naughtiness.\nAslan taught me things that no classroom ever could...or would.\nAslan taught me problem-solving when he, recognizing my inexperience, would refuse to let me catch him in his large pasture, leaving me sprinting from corner to corner, halter in hand, as he reveled in the impromptu game of tag with his pasture mates \u2014 I was always \u201cit.\u201d This was especially humbling during the winter months when the rain would turn the high-traffic corner of the pasture into a treacherous pit of thick and sticky mud, my rubber boots making a grotesque sucking sound each time I pulled my foot free of the muck. On one memorable occasion, I remember Aslan teasingly approaching, nearly within my reach, so that I lunged in an effort to catch him, only to fall flat on my face, nose deep in God-only-knows-what, my boots still standing upright, free of my socked feet.\nAslan taught me to be detail-oriented when I would (finally) bring him in from his pasture, the marbling of his brown and white coat caked in a solid shell of dried mud. I would spend up to an hour currying in frantic circles, my arm growing numb as I choked on the thickening cloud of dust and hair, until his coat was smooth and free of clinging clods. Horses were to be properly groomed for lessons and anything less than immaculate was unacceptable.\nAslan taught me responsibility every time he decided to\u2026relieve himself\u2026at the most inopportune moments, which was pretty much always. One of the rules of the barn was always to keep things tidy, which meant a whole lot of scooping, sweeping, scrubbing, shoveling, and sweating. And stench. Always the stench. Over time, I learned to be quick enough that I would have a shovel ready at the first hint of a rising tail, ready to intercept the plop before it ever touched the ground.\nAslan taught me precision when he refused to transition from a trot to a canter \u2014 unless I asked correctly. To canter (or lope) is every beginner\u2019s first big dream, and after so many sessions of walking and trotting, first on a lunge-line and then around the perimeter of the ring, I was ready. Aslan thought differently. If you\u2019ve never experienced this particularly humbling phenomenon firsthand, trust me when I say there are few things as mortifying as being \u201cpony-schooled\u201d by a horse who refuses to work harder than he has to, and gleefully rattles your bones as he trots at warp speed, with all the finesse of a rogue jackhammer, all because you haven\u2019t asked with just-so accuracy.\nEventually, Aslan taught me exhilaration when I finally asked correctly and the tooth-rattling jackhammer trot suddenly lifted and softened into the glorious rocking motion of a proper canter stride. The rush of the air caused my eyes to water ever-so-slightly as we moved with three-beated swiftness around the perimeter of the ring. I felt weightless and powerful and elegant \u2014 all at the same time. I felt proud.\nAslan taught me about leads and diagonals and counting strides. He taught me to halter, to groom, to saddle, to bridle. He taught me how to ask, then tell. He taught me about the magic of whitening shampoo and the importance of a handy hoofpick. He taught me to care for his needs before worrying after my own.\nWhen I outgrew Aslan, I moved on to riding Aggie, then Pio, and then my very own first horse, a palomino named Blondie. Even after taking a break from horse ownership as I transitioned from high school to university, I rode dozens of horses throughout my college years, and then dozens more when I re-entered the horse world after graduate school. My own personal rite of passage into adulthood was the purchase of Sienna and Tucker, the pair of bay thoroughbreds I still own today.\nI\u2019ve made no secret of the fact that I was an anxious and introverted child \u2014 and that I am an anxious and introverted adult. I\u2019ve managed to find ways to work through these things as I\u2019ve grown, but being \u201ctightly wound\u201d seems to be a part of my nature, and I\u2019ve learned to work with it rather than fight against it.\nHorses are a huge part of this.\nTo this day, I\u2019m what you might call \u201chorse poor,\u201d but I consider it an investment in my mental health.\nTo be at the barn is to be at ease.\nMy shoulders are relaxed. My breaths are deep. I can sit silently on the lid of my tack trunk next to my horse\u2019s stall and melt into the sounds of whinnies and nickers and swishing tails and the munching of hay. I can trail ride through the vineyards and watch the sun sink below the horizon and into the grapes.\nNow, all these years later, I get to teach my own nieces and nephews the ins and outs of the horse world. I get to watch as they learn the straps of a halter, the meaning of ask-then-tell, and the importance of a handy hoofpick. I get to watch as they learn all of the priceless lessons that just can\u2019t quite be taught as beautifully by anyone \u2014 or anything \u2014 else.\n\u201cGirls and their horses. Such a wonderful phase.\u201d\nIndeed.\nAnd it all started with that scrappy little one-eyed horse.", "comment_count": 4, "like_count": 117, "created_time": 1642483639310, "comment": [{"user_id": "23a4307290a3", "comment_time": 1642483639310, "comment": "Thank you for sharing!"}, {"user_id": "3c2e86203411", "comment_time": 1647579388080, "comment": "Really interesting"}, {"user_id": "a4f6f6078b8a", "comment_time": 1647689595904, "comment": "Me too"}, {"user_id": "a4f6f6078b8a", "comment_time": 1647689378909, "comment": "Me too"}, {"user_id": "a4f6f6078b8a", "comment_time": 1647689147894, "comment": "I remember those."}], "post_tag": ["Horses", "Childhood Memories", "Horseback Riding", "Childhood", "Reflections"]}, {"author": "Ellie Reaves", "post_id": "ec0d9528a9c0", "user_id": "23a4307290a3", "title": "The Kids Are (Going to Be) Alright", "content": "The Kids Are (Going to Be) Alright\nWhy today\u2019s teens give me hope.\nPhoto by Zachary Nelson on Unsplash\nWhen I tell people what I do for a living, the conversation usually goes something like this:\n\u201cWhat do you do?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m a teacher.\u201d\n\u201cOh!

I was about to tell her that she was welcome to step outside and take a breath when her classmates took over for me.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got this!\u201d they chanted. Others clapped and nodded encouragingly. \u201cWe\u2019ve got you,\u201d they promised. They cheered when she finished.\nThere was the student who had been with me for four years and had struggled with his identity for the bulk of his high school career. During his senior year, in the midst of a class discussion, he came out, informing his long-time classmates that he was gay. I could see the terror in his eyes. His fists were clenched as he awaited their reaction. I held my breath \u2014 not in fear but in anticipation.\n\u201cCongratulations!\u201d they crowed. \u201cWe\u2019re so happy for you!\u201d\nIt was the first time he had uttered the words aloud. They embraced him.\nOne of the most remarkable phenomena I have witnessed in my sixteen years as a educator is this: Every time I have a bad day and I feel ready to throw in the towel, some unsuspecting student blesses me with the gift of gratitude or a gesture of kindness, reminding me why I live my life according to bell schedules and essay deadlines. When I reach the end of my day and feel like I\u2019ve fallen short of nearly every expectation I\u2019ve set for myself, there\u2019s a knock at the door and a former student appears, ready to reminisce on our shared classroom days. When I start to fold beneath the weight of my own lack of \u201cenoughness,\u201d a group of squirrely freshman will appear, insisting that I hear their latest tale of woe.\nThey never know how perfect their timing is.\nThe kids are engaged.\nIn the past several years, I have been approached by more students than I can count about their desire to become activists in a variety of areas.\nOne group became acutely aware of the power our young people can have if they become politically aware, and they proceeded to start a club focused on voter registration. Students with beliefs spanning the political spectrum joined forces and worked to ensure that their peers understand the power that comes with the vote. They held virtual meetings, shared links, organized virtual voter registration drives, and committed to helping their family members vote, many of them for the very first time.\nAnother group of young women approached me with their desire to start a feminist club on campus \u2014 open to all \u2014 where they could engage in open discussions of the everyday issues they face. They made a concentrated effort to create an intersectional community, and they have done a stellar job of ensuring that they invite authentic voices to speak truth to every issue and every experience. The result has been a group that oscillates in its function, from a think-tank brainstorming solutions and raising funds for impactful organizations, to a cocoon of support providing a soft place to land in times of struggle.\nYet another group worked totally on their own to start a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to assisting the youth of our community as they cope with many of the challenges presented by the unique circumstances of our city.\nThe kids see problems. But they see the solutions too.\nThe kids are brave.\nEveryone is familiar with the can-do spirit that emerged during the early days of the pandemic. As terrified as we all were of the unknown boogey-man that was COVID, there was something inspiring about the narrative that emerged. We all heard tales of the essential workers who became the heroes of the day, the people who had long gone unsung who were suddenly vital to the day-to-day functioning of society.\nEveryone saw those stories. Not everyone saw what teachers beheld on their Zoom screens.\nWe saw our kids, these children, stepping up to take responsibility for their own education. And many of the ones we didn\u2019t see were only missing because they were stepping up to take responsibility for their families.\nI saw students bouncing younger siblings on their laps. I saw students making meals for their families. I heard students translating for their parents. I saw students in work uniforms, working in class, only to spend the next several hours working at a job.\nI saw their fear of the unknown and their ache for connection. Their frustration and their dedication. I heard them ask for help, and I saw them accept help with grace.\nI saw grit.\nThe kids are curious.\nAny teacher will tell you: The questions are never-ending.\nWhat is it like to get older when you\u2019re always teaching kids who are the same age?\nWhy do people make us learn science in school if they\u2019re gonna ignore science in real life?\nDo you think it\u2019s more important to make a lot of money or make a lot of difference?\nHow do you ACTUALLY use a semicolon?\nDo you really think the author thought this hard about the story?\nWhy do all the stories we read in school end with the main characters dying?\nAnd then there are gems like these ones:\nIs it technically cannibalism if you eat a mermaid?\nWere there color TVs when you were a kid?\nHow did you delete a wrong number on one of those old spinny-click phones?\nIs a zombie a person or an object?\nDo they sometimes try their hardest to steer me away from the day\u2019s lesson? Of course. What kind of teens would they be if they didn\u2019t? But do they also pose legitimately thoughtful questions that prompt me to pause, ponder, and set aside the day\u2019s assignment to grab hold of that fleeting chance at an authentic teachable moment? Absolutely.\nThe kids are funny as hell.\nI can\u2019t imagine laughing this hard this often in any other role.\nI once informed my students that I cannot stand the taste of watermelon, and it became the stuff of legend. It was the answer to a trivia question at a school wide rally, it is the first thing younger siblings mention when they tell me their older sibling was in my class, and I have accumulated more watermelon themed gifts than I can count: drawings, socks, mugs, lip glosses, paintings, and a personalized pair of watermelon Crocs. My students treat watermelons like they are my kryptonite, and their glee at my (mock) horror never fails to make me smile.\nThe antics continue.\nI once heard a story, with all of the suspenseful build-up of a Stephen King novel, about a student who lost his pet lizard and mourned it for days \u2014 only to discover it hiding in his hair one morning.\nMy students started a Cat Wall in my classroom, a tradition which lasted ten years and led to a frightening number of cat images forming a gradual (and disconcerting) feline collage.\nI once had a group Rickroll me during a live presentation \u2014 performing an impressively timed and well-rehearsed switch from a somber bit of Shakespeare to an energetic rendition of Astley.\nThey leave silly notes and cartoons on their papers \u2014 many which make me giggle when I\u2019m succumbing to an essay-induced madness.\nEven more importantly, they make me giggle when I\u2019m succumbing to society-induced madness.\nThe kids are still kids.\nThere will undoubtedly be people reading this who will reflect upon their own negative encounters with teens and will see this as a celebration of mediocrity. They will roll their eyes and scoff about selfies and phones and TikTok challenges, ignorant to the fact that every generation has had their own brand of childish rebellion. The fact is, there will always be students who prompt me to clench my teeth and take a deep breath. They sometimes drive me nuts with their eye-rolling, foot-dragging, excuse-giving, late-arriving habits. It is in those moments that I think of them as newborn babies \u2014 squirming, sweet, and unscathed by life.\nBut when I peer through their hastily hung and threadbare curtains of sleep deprivation and ego-fueled bravado, I see the things that matter.\nI think of my tough-talking ninth grader who tries with all her might to convey a total lack of regard for anything and everything \u2014 and then sends a nonchalant email letting me know that I should \u201cdefinitely come\u201d to her basketball game even though they \u201care definitely gonna lose.\u201d\nThey seek connection.\nI think of the students who run me ragged during their early high school years and then return just before graduation to apologize sheepishly for their silly antics.\nThey grow.\nI think of the students who tell me they\u2019re afraid to leave high school because they don\u2019t know what they want to do with their lives \u2014 they just know they want to do something and be someone.\nThey care.\nI think of the students who are sprinting at life, arms wide open, hungry for the chance to live it fully and anxious for the chance to live it well.\nThey hope.\nAt the end of the day, what nearly every single one of these kids wants is to feel valued. To feel like their teacher looks at them and sees someone worthy of time, energy, and enthusiasm.\nIsn\u2019t that what we all want?\nThere are plenty of things I fear about the future, but when I think of a future as it will unfold with my students at the helm, I\u2019m comforted.\nWhy do I teach high school?\nThe kids.\nThey\u2019re not perfect, but they\u2019re pretty damned good.\nIt\u2019s a start.", "comment_count": 6, "like_count": 261, "created_time": 1642001578009, "comment": [{"user_id": "23a4307290a3", "comment_time": 1642001578009, "comment": "Thank you for sharing!"}, {"user_id": "104fe11abba4", "comment_time": 1645116114297, "comment": "Felt the same way about the students that rolled through my classroom.

Finally.\nWho knew meme-culture (and pandemics) could bring the world\u2019s wallflowers to the forefront?\nWhen I was a kid, I didn\u2019t have the benefit of the quirky relatability now associated with this label. I wasn\u2019t aware that there was a label at all.\nI was just sort of weird.\nWhile I did enjoy playing with my friends from the neighborhood and spending time at the park across the street, I often preferred to spend my time reading beneath the curtain of the weeping willow branch that swept over our backyard fence, creating a perfect little nook of shade. Or I was content to play quietly in my bedroom, using my own imagination for company. I would read or draw or write stories of my own. It\u2019s not so much that I minded the company of others; I just didn\u2019t feel the need to surround myself with people, as I felt quite comfortable in my own creative cocoon.\nIn school, I was just called shy. While I thrived within the task-driven confines of the school day, I struggled when released to the \u201cfreedom\u201d of the Parks and Recreation after-school program. Socializing felt more like work than any spelling worksheet or math packet, and it made me anxious from a very early age. While I was supposed to attend \u201cRec\u201d immediately after school, I found myself begging my first grade teacher for classroom chores each day. Most students lept from their chairs like horses from the starting gate at the sound of the final bell, but I felt a sense of dread at the prospect of having to enter the chaos and noise of the Rec room. Wreck, indeed.\nTo make matters worse, I was a hypersensitive child, and my aloofness caused others to think of me as weird or even snobby, which prompted me to retreat further into my shell to shield myself from the implicit rejection. Phrases like \u201coversensitive\u201d and \u201cthin skinned\u201d became my staple descriptors, and I internalized them early on, remedying the problem over time with a steady diet of sarcasm and performative flippancy.\nI always envied my more extroverted friends, and I find that I tend to gravitate toward these people even in adulthood, precisely because they possess so many of the qualities I lack. That other people actually gain energy from even the most surface-level of interactions has always been completely baffling to me. My best friend during childhood was one of those marvels. Gregarious and outgoing, she seemed to bubble over with charisma, and many of my childhood adventures were experienced on her coattails. I wondered at the ease with which she navigated the treacherous waters of social interaction. I envied her magnetism and the way others seemed ready to follow her lead. I didn\u2019t understand why she seemed to thrive in situations that left me feeling inert and fragile.\nI just knew that I wanted what she had.\nLike so many other introverts, I am a survivor of a society that seeks to \u201cextro\u201d the \u201cintros.\u201d\nFrom elementary schools and summer camps to staff retreats and professional conferences, our society always seemed hellbent on forcing connection and collaboration at the expense of solitude and mindfulness. Participation points were always awarded on the basis of speaking, of standing, of playing, of joining, rather than recognizing that speakers need listeners, actors need an audience, and that some leaders are built on the hard work and great minds of the people who are content to remain behind the curtain. I was always told that it was good to venture out of one\u2019s comfort zone, and I took this advice to heart, but I always wondered what this looked like for my extroverted friends. Were their grades ever contingent upon their tolerance of routine (non-academic) discomfort?\nAnd don\u2019t even get me started on icebreakers.\nI can assure you that the fastest way to lose me is to force me to share trivial facts with a series of name-tagged strangers.\nI have yet to participate in a merry-go-round of shallow questions that has left me feeling more inclined to engage. Instead, I am emotionally drained by the act. These activities, which are supposed to serve as warm-ups for the work of the day, suck every bit of social energy from my very limited supply. Will I participate? Yes. Do I gain from the experience? No.\nI can fake it with the best of them. I can smile and laugh my way through the day without ever letting on that I feel like I\u2019m being crushed by the incessant and shallow interaction. But I will absolutely crash face-first into my couch when I get home, and the only cure for what ails me will be a spoonful of ice cream and a Golden Girls rerun, because I am Dorothy and the whole world is my Stan.\nCertainly I understand that there is value in the ability to collaborate with others. I\u2019m a believer in fostering such skills in my own students. But so often we take it to unnecessary levels and treat extroversion as the standard.\nTake the age-old trick of putting students on the spot to make sure they\u2019re paying attention, for instance. As a lifelong goody-goody, I can assure you that I was always paying attention, and I was perfectly willing to raise my hand to offer an answer or an opinion. It might have taken me a good ten minutes to formulate the perfect two-word reply, settle on the proper tone and volume, and then muster the courage to actually lift my hand in the air, but I would do it.\nWhat I couldn\u2019t handle was being put on the spot. Not because I hadn\u2019t done my homework or hadn\u2019t completed the reading, but because it didn\u2019t give me the opportunity to emotionally prepare for the burning sensation that accompanied thirty sets of eyes fixed on me. I would sit in my seat, palms sweating, earlobes heated to a piping shade of magenta, my stomach roiling, as I waited for the possibility that I would be called upon to provide a response. I was so anxious about the possibility of random selection that literally nothing my teacher said was actually making its way into my brain. I guess it never occurred to those teachers that the constant threat of unsolicited attention actually prevented some students from learning.\nI\u2019d like to say that my poise in these situations has changed in adulthood, but really I\u2019ve just become a better actor.\nMost recently, I was unexpectedly singled out during a staff meeting to be given a surprise award, and while I managed to maintain a strained smile of appreciation for the duration of the presentation, I had to step outside immediately after because I was overcome by the abundance of attention, and I hadn\u2019t been given the opportunity to prepare myself for it.\nOther telltale signs of my lingering introverted spirit include but are not limited to panicking when I receive an email, cringing at the sound of an incoming text, ignoring all actual phone calls, having a ready-made list of potential excuses for why I cannot possibly leave my home to socialize with others, and a lifelong avoidance of large parties where I might be forced to share my name, my occupation, and how I know the host on an endless loop.\nFor most of my life, I\u2019ve been led to believe that my introversion was a flaw. When I wished to listen, I was told it was better to speak. When I wished to watch, I was told it was better to play. When I wished to abstain, I was told it was better to join.\nIt wasn\u2019t until Susan Cain\u2019s book Quiet was released that I started to hear others speak of the societal preference for extroversion. Leaders are loud. They\u2019re gregarious. They\u2019re fearless. They\u2019re charismatic. My sister is an extrovert, and she is all of these things. Unsurprisingly, she is also (and has always been) much more popular than me among our family and friends. I say this without an ounce of resentment (truly!) because popularity involves attention and interaction, and I think I\u2019ve more than established my desire to avoid those two things with the same level of dedication and persistence that I have used to avoid COVID for the past two years.\nOur reticence isn\u2019t always borne from laziness \u2014 although sometimes I do just want to stay home and stare at the ceiling from beneath my cozy blanket. Rather, our reticence is often borne from a desire to be purposeful. To be thoughtful. To be efficient in channeling our very precious and finite social energy in a manner that will serve us without inadvertently slighting those around us.\nWe want to engage \u2014 we just need to be selective because our social energy has a cap. Thankfully, it seems the world is finally starting to understand.\nEven after all these years, I still catch myself wishing for the gift of extroversion, of charisma. A student once teasingly said to me, \u201cYou grow on people\u2026like a fungus.\u201d Her momentary irreverence aside, this is true. I have to grow on people. I need time and exposure to flourish. And sometimes I just want to be instantly magnetic: the kind of person people adore at first sight.\nBut there is power in reservation. In observation. In solitude.\nAs an introvert, I have more than thirty years of keen observation at my disposal when I need to make split-second decisions or on-the-spot judgments. As an introvert, I am comfortable with solitude and have learned to be my own best company. As an introvert, I treat my time and social energy like they are precious and not to be wasted.\nAs an introvert, I have the power to support the next generation of introverts. This doesn\u2019t mean demanding anything less than their best efforts, but it does mean not propelling them into a state of mental paralysis because they\u2019re so terrified that I\u2019m going to call their name. It\u2019s about recognizing that not everyone desires the spotlight \u2014 even when it\u2019s celebratory. It means celebrating the value of quiet participation: the listeners, the observers, the behind-the-scenes workers, and assuring them that quiet contributions are no less meaningful.\nI\u2019m thankful that introversion is finally having a moment.\n(I just prefer to celebrate at home.)", "comment_count": 79, "like_count": 4494, "created_time": 1638156531966, "comment": [{"user_id": "23a4307290a3", "comment_time": 1638156531966, "comment": "Thank you for sharing!"}, {"user_id": "dabf09ccf26b", "comment_time": 1642507711949, "comment": "Introverts Unite!

From age 4 to 16, I made the trek from Denver \u2014 where I lived \u2014 to my violin teacher\u2019s house in order to take private lessons from him. These lessons became the way I demarcated time: I kept track of the days based on how many were left until my lessons: six days left, four days left, only one more day left. I also obsessively calculated how much time I had spent practicing: four hours total on scales, only three hours on my etudes, 5 hours toward my concerto. In my violin teacher\u2019s studio there was a digital clock, and I would constantly glance over, counting down the amount of minutes until I could leave.\nAs my fixation on time probably indicates, another defining trait of my childhood was the constant feeling of anxiety. On the car rides to my lessons, I would shake, on the verge of tears, out of sheer nervousness for what was to come. No matter how much I practiced, I never felt prepared enough; I was constantly anticipating failure.\nThis anxiety seeped into my life, because violin was integrated into every aspect of my life, in and outside of school. I attended an arts middle and high school where I was an orchestra major, so I spent every weekday rehearsing, \u201cimproving\u201d my craft. Further, I was also a member of an organization called the Denver Young Artists Orchestra, which is where I became familiar with the Hodges family.\nIf you were a part of DYAO or even just a classical musician in Denver, you knew who the Hodges were. The Hodges\u2019 four children have been a fixture in the classical music world of Denver for over a decade; they\u2019re basically local celebrities. When I was in elementary school, my sister was in DYAO at the same time as the oldest Hodges kid, Natalie. Natalie had no idea who I was, but I was deeply in awe of her. She was an amazing violinist, easily the best one in the orchestra. She was also incredibly intelligent (she went on to study at Harvard) as well as unendingly sweet and humble. She was everything that I wanted to be: a talented musician, hardworking, nice, well-liked. Mostly, I was in awe of the way music seemed to glide from her instrument, like performing was simply second nature.\nWhen my sister told me that Natalie had written a book, Uncommon Measure: A Journey Through Music, Performance, and the Science of Time, I obviously bought it on the spot. Luckily enough, I discovered that she would also be coming to New York to do a book reading event at McNally Jackson Books in Seaport. I have never read a book so fast and with such ferocity; I was completely unable to put it down. In the book, Hodges writes of her struggle with performance anxiety and fear of failure, connecting her relationship with violin to the way she experiences time. I had always held the ignorant belief that because it appeared as if music came easily to her, that that must be true. I never questioned my preconceived notion that we shared no common experiences with playing violin because it seemed like she was made for performing, whereas I was not. It was absolutely revolutionary, then, to learn that her experience of time was wrapped up in violin just like me, and that she felt just as anxious as I did before performances.\nUncommon Measure, which first began as her senior thesis at Harvard, was published by the Bellevue Literary Press last month. In it, Hodges explores her relationship with music through the fields of quantum mechanics and physics, imbuing quantitative meaning into the feelings that she (and also all humans) holds towards music \u2014 why, she questions, does the thing she has loved so fiercely and for so long also cause her so much pain?\nThe premise of this book is incredibly intimate, and Hodges does not shy away from baring all. The tone of her writing is confessional, as if she wrote it only for her own consumption. This, I think, is what makes Uncommon Measure so touching. The contemplative and honest way in which Hodges ponders her place in life after the realization that she cannot be a soloist invites the reader to let down their walls as well, creating a safe environment for them to confront and process their own pain whether it be music-related or not. Hodges masterfully blends together personal narrative and quantitative concepts often in Uncommon Time \u2014 neither appear out of place in her writing. In fact, science and storytelling work together with surprising harmony, both helping to enhance the efficacy of the other.\nIn the second chapter of the book, entitled \u201cUntrainment,\u201d Hodges recounts a memory of having stage fright while performing \u201cLa Campanella\u201d by Paganini during her senior year of high school. She explains that the piece is characterized by its \u201cdevilish\u201d harmonies and that she had been having particular trouble with executing the ending. Although the performance had been going \u201cunbelievably well,\u201d when she snuck a glance at her violin teacher sitting in the audience, thoughts of failure crept in and panic overwhelmed her. Her hands froze up, and she ended up dropping her bow right before the final chord. Hodges describes how she vividly remembers feeling as if time had stopped in that moment, betraying \u201cthe flow\u201d of the music.\nThis metaphor of flowing like water is very fitting when it comes to performance. The nature of music is that it is transient; you can never perform a piece the same way twice, just as you cannot step in the same river twice. In some aspects, this is the beauty of music \u2014 every note is unique and reflective of the variables of the moment in which it is being played. This mutability is at the same time, however, the bane of a classical musician\u2019s existence. You can practice as much as you would like, but, as Hodges notes in her book, \u201cjust because you did it before doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll be able to do it now, in front of [the audience].\u201d Thus, she comes to the eloquent and well thought-out conclusion that \u201cperformance anxiety is, in part, the anxiety of recreation.\u201d\nPerformance anxiety is something that I have also struggled with throughout my career as a violinist. I often spent the days leading up to my studio\u2019s recitals praying to every deity that I could think of in a last-ditch effort to cancel the performance. Anything so that I wouldn\u2019t have to play. I would succumb to panic attacks at night, wracked with sobs because all I could envision was all the potential mistakes that I would make on the stage. My anxiety was a terrible self-fulfilling prophecy, though, because being afraid of failure was exactly what led to it. Logically, I knew that the most difficult passages were the ones where it was most imperative that I maintain a relaxed posture and clear head in order for the music to speak. In reality, however, my anxiety always overrode every other thought in my head and inevitably confirmed my worst fear: that I wasn\u2019t good enough.\nAfter every recital, what I felt most ashamed of was my inability to make up for all the sacrifices that my parents made so that I could receive a musical education. I wanted to love violin, and I wanted so badly to be good at it so that all the time, energy, and money that my parents poured into my lessons would be worth it. So, the fact that I never could live up to that expectation was, and still is, devastating. In the chapter entitled \u201cSymmetry Breaking,\u201d Hodges reveals that she felt the same need to validate the sacrifices of her mother, to make sure that she wasn\u2019t taking her violin lessons for granted. This is the section of the book that made me most emotional (re: ugly cry) because I saw the dynamics of my own family reflected in Hodges\u2019 words. Her mother is an immigrant from Asia who worked as a waitress in order to support her family, just the same as mine. Her relationship with her mother also resembles my own in that it has always been an \u201cimbalanced equation.\u201d Our mothers always give, and we always take.\nI was also struck by how similar her parents\u2019 relationship is to mine. She explains how her parents\u2019 marriage has always been tinged with cruelty, yet her mother was \u201cwilling to endure it, that she has always been willing to endure anything\u201d for the sake of her kids. My mother has told me that she, too, is willing to endure any hardship for my sister and I. In Uncommon Time, Hodges writes how she asked her mother whether she regrets marrying their father, and her mother responded with a fervent shaking of the head, saying that \u201c[she] has the children [she] was meant to have.\u201d My mother has said almost those exact words to me when I asked her the same question. I am often wracked with guilt that I am able to enjoy the luxury of playing violin, of following my passions, or even of finding love while my mother was unable to do any of those things. When I voice these lamentations to her in an effort to convey how grateful I am for everything that she has given me, though, my mother simply reassures me that the role of a parent is to give their children what they did not have, and that by simply living life I am paying back her sacrifice.\nSince I arrived at college, I\u2019ve been attempting to repair my relationship with violin. Classical music has become an integral part of me and it will never leave, so I needed to find a way to enjoy playing the violin instead of being haunted by it. Something that Hodges said at her book event that has continued to ring in my ears is that if music is defined by its temporality, then writing is defined by its permanence. Hodges stated that writing has given her solace in a way music has never been able to; it allows her to create narratives that are permanent. She playfully said that she knows the writing will still be there when she revisits it, unlike musical pieces. I never realized why I have always felt the urge to write until she said this; I am desperate to convey my thoughts in a manner that is permanent, which is why I have never been able to shape music in a way that feels satisfying or fulfilling. Because of this new perspective on playing music and writing that Uncommon Measure gave me, I am finally able to relinquish the anxiety that has always accompanied my relationship with violin, and instead simply enjoy the music.", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 2, "created_time": 1650025201411, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Entertainment", "Music", "Book Review", "Novel", "Violin"]}, {"author": "Sandy Battulga", "post_id": "eebd5adbac7a", "user_id": "c331868d9084", "title": "Tuesday Tracks: \u201cAtomized\u201d by Andrew Bird", "content": "Tuesday Tracks: \u201cAtomized\u201d by Andrew Bird\nBird\u2019s newest single traverses across the planes of time and genre with its commentary on our digital world.\nGraphic by author.\nThe Oxford English Dictionary defines the word \u201catomize\u201d as \u201cto divide into small units.\u201d Indie-rock singer-songwriter Andrew Bird explores this idea \u2014 \u201cthe proof that things fall apart\u201d \u2014 in his latest single \u201cAtomized.\u201d Despite coming across as upbeat and danceable, \u201cAtomized\u201d reveals itself to be a deeply reflective commentary on how the fragmentation of society has now progressed to individual people becoming fractured due to technology.\nIn an interview with NME Magazine, Bird stated that with \u201cAtomized\u201d he seeks to follow the thread of social criticism that Joan Didion explored in her literary career, mainly in the collection of essays entitled \u201cSlouching Towards Bethlehem,\u201d title deriving from a W.B. Yeats\u2019 poem called \u201cThe Second Coming.\u201d As stated by Mary Spencer in the National Review, in the essays Didion examines \u201cthe roots from which American civil life has decayed\u201d though her \u201cthoughtful tracing of disparate lives.\u201d Just as Didion updated the writing of Yeats to examine the counterculture of the \u201cfractious \u201860s,\u201d Bird in turn modernizes Didion to apply to our \u201cpixelated present where it\u2019s not just society that is getting atomized but the self that is being broken apart and scattered,\u201d he said.\nBird emphasizes the lyrical message of \u201cAtomized\u201d with buoyant and pixelated instrumentation. The song begins with a few bars that feature only a drum beat, drawing in the listener with its rhythmic groove. The other instrumental components are introduced on an upbeat, bringing a sudden cascade of strings and the clear tone of Bird\u2019s characteristic whistle. A jaunty, folk-inspired tune that\u2019s plucked out on the violin materializes as Bird sings the first verse: \u201cThey\u2019re gonna try to get a rise/To unseat you/They\u2019ll demagnetize your poles/And you know they\u2019re gonna try to delete you/So now you\u2019re atomized, unwhole.\u201d\nThe lyrics seem to speak to how the rise of social media has made possible the careful curation of one\u2019s identity online. In the digital age, people are reduced down to only a fragment of who they are as a whole, which is done both intentionally and unintentionally, as with cancel culture. A term that began in the wake of the #MeToo movement, cancel culture has taken on a roaring life of its own with some defending the act of \u201ccancelling\u201d as \u201can expression of agency\u201d and \u201cfree speech,\u201d while others criticize it for being dehumanizing in its denial of allowing \u201cthe cancelled individual the most basic of human opportunities: to apologise and to be absolved.\u201d\nBird addresses the lack of nuance in cancel culture and the subsequent feeling of isolation that comes with \u201ccancelling\u201d in the pre-chorus of the track, singing: \u201cYou know better start making your apologies/Stop blaming technology, yeah/Blaming technology, oh/May you please, may you start making your apologies, oh/Blaming technology, yeah/Blaming technology, oh.\u201d The repeated \u201cStop blaming technology\u201d and \u201cstart making your apologies\u201d are sung in a higher pitch, evoking the sense of desperation and lack of control that comes with being cancelled. These lyrics also speak to how cancelling is a phenomenon made possible only by social media, and how the greater degree of accountability that the internet has provided is also the cause of increased societal polarization.\nIn the chorus, Bird pivots to the classical music cannon by borrowing a melody from the second movement of Beethoven\u2019s Seventh Symphony. This musical line is much more linear than the prior upbeat pizzicato, creating a juxtaposition and melding of not only musical style but time as well. There is a clash between traditional and modern, and what is already established and what is still yet to be seen. This musical clash underscores the lyrical message of \u201cAtomized\u201d: Societal fragmentation is a process already known to us by way of W.B. Yeats and Joan Didion, but the digital age has caused a new branch of fragmentation by breaking up individual identity.\nYou can stream \u201cAtomized\u201d on Spotify, Apple Music, Youtube, and everywhere else.

Do you feel like everyone else has their lives together except you? Do you need songs to accompany the mini-meltdowns you have in the shower? Then Wallice is the artist for you \u2014 and so is her latest single, \u201cLittle League.\u201d\nWallice, whose full name is Wallice Hana Watanabe, is a 23-year-old singer-songwriter hailing from Los Angeles who quickly gained popularity over quarantine with the release of her song \u201cPunching Bag\u201d in October 2020. What makes her music so relatable and easy to like is the way she speaks to the growing pains of getting older, highlighting the inner turmoil and unique experiences that accompany that awkward intermediary stage between \u201cteenager\u201d and \u201cadult.\u201d\nHer latest single \u201cLittle League,\u201d which was released on Feb. 15, is no different. In the song, Wallice reckons with being unable to rectify the negative traits that have persisted within her ever since childhood. In the pre-chorus she sings, \u201cI get reckless, I get mean/Been this way since little league/Follow the rules so close it hurts/Try to change, but nothing works.\u201d Wallice reflects upon the way she guiltily caves into her overly competitive nature, despite knowing that it will sabotage her relationships. The result is an inevitable feeling of guilt which she expresses in the chorus, its upbeat tempo clashing with the bitterness of the lyrics: \u201cThen I cry myself to sleep, I think everyone hates me/I project all my flaws, I\u2019m such a fucking baby/Over and over again/I think I\u2019m losing all my friends.\u201d\nThe \u201cLittle League\u201d music video features Wallice in three different scenes: a little league game, a board game, and a tennis match. Each scenario features an over-competitive Wallice who becomes disproportionately determined and aggressive throughout the course of the video as the song increases in intensity. The other people that Wallice is playing with eventually end up leaving, turned off by her bad sportsmanship. She is ultimately left alone, having achieved her desire to win but at the steep cost of her friendships.\nThe quality of the video itself is hazy, as if it has been filmed with a camera that has a film of Vaseline over the lens. The result is a dreamy, pastel-colored ambiance that calls to the past and childhood memories, as well as the aesthetic of the 1970s. Her vocals are also fuzzy, soft and undefined with a slight grittiness. Combined with the consistent bass and synthetic wailing in the background, a buzz seems to emanate from the song that contributes to the overall half-awake, half-asleep nature of the music video.\nSimilar to fellow indie-pop artist Ginger Root, Wallice draws influence from the sounds and visuals from past decades but subverts them to create a unique sound, uniting vintage and modern. With her songs and the music videos that accompany them, Wallice crafts auditory and visual narratives that cause the listener to yearn for a bygone area, that of their own adolescence and of someone else\u2019s past that they\u2019ve never experienced yet feel deeply connected to.\nWallice has made a name for herself in the realm of indie-pop, having garnered 12.1 million streams, 2.7 million listeners, and 508,200 hours of streaming in 174 countries. She has also been featured in numerous publications such as The New York Times, Nylon Magazine, and Notion. Wallice has attracted the attention of other well-established artists, namely Sven Eric Gamsky (or more commonly known as Still Woozy), who she is currently opening for on tour. The ambient and undulating color of Still Woozy\u2019s discography perfectly accompanies the dreamy tone of Wallice\u2019s, creating a marriage of sound that oozes good vibes and out-of-body experiences.\nYou can stream Wallice and \u201cLittle League\u201d on Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube, and everywhere else.

(Image courtesy of doyouremember.com)\nIt seems like everyone is giving the issue of student loans the Bob Rumson treatment: making you afraid of it and telling you who\u2019s to blame for it.\nThat\u2019s how you win elections and sell newspapers, but it does nothing to actually help solve the problem.\nMy question is this: is there really a student loan problem to be solved?\nThe answer, like most things, is nuanced, and is different for different groups of people.\nFor some, student loans are a nuisance that drain a few hundred bucks out of their bank accounts every month, but overall are just the price of admission to the next rung on the socioeconomic ladder.\nFor others, student loans are a permanent shackle around their necks from which there is no escape, weighing down their finances to the point where even covering utility bills takes second place to their student loan payments.\nSo who makes up these two camps? Let\u2019s take a look.\nGetting the Correct Data\nThere are a few things we need to get sorted out before defining those borrowers who are in crisis. First up is the job market contributing to the demand for college degrees, and thus student loans.\nThe Downside of a Global Job Market\nThe percent of college educated Millennials is higher than any other previous generation, which generally indicates much higher lifetime earnings, especially as they advance in their careers.\nIn fact, Millennials are the most educated generation ever, with 39% of us achieving at least a bachelor\u2019s degree, a full 10 percentage points higher than any other generation since World War II.\nHowever, Millennials are also trying to get jobs in the most demanding job market ever. Even with power starting to shift towards workers during the Great Resignation/Reshuffling, it\u2019s still damn hard to get your foot in the door without at least a bachelor\u2019s degree.\nTake this excerpt from a PBS interview about job requirements:\nGuest: Even though two-thirds of administrative assistants don\u2019t have bachelor\u2019s degrees, three-quarters of the new job postings for administrative assistants say you have to have a bachelor\u2019s degree to be considered for that job.\nSo, two-thirds of the people who currently do that job can\u2019t apply for three-quarters of the new jobs in the field. (emphasis added)\nHere\u2019s another one.\nGuest: Sometimes, a company will require a college degree just because they can.\nSometimes, a company will get 10,000 applicants for one job. How do they winnow them out? One of the easiest ways is just to require a college degree.\nInterviewer: Well, this is obviously discriminatory against people who don\u2019t have a college degree, right?\nGuest: Well, but you can\u2019t accuse a company of discriminating because they ask for a college degree, can you?\nYou can\u2019t process people through a database, but you can process their keywords through a database, and a college degree is nothing more than a keyword. (emphasis added)\nThis is what happens when you are in a global job market and everyone can apply online: you have thousands of applicants vying for the same opportunity, and you need to stand out. One of the easiest ways to stand out is with a college degree.\nI like to juxtapose the current job market with a story from my mom\u2019s career, which basically reads like an Old Economy Steve meme.\nMy parents had just moved to England due to my dad being stationed at RAF Lakenheath. My mom asked about a job on base and was told that she was one of 153 other applicants.\nNot wanting to wait 18 months to get a job just to leave in another 12, she got a paper, perused the classified ads, called up a company, got an interview, and started the next week, all as a foreign national.\nThat type of thing just doesn't happen anymore.\nThe Size of the Problem\nAs of late 2021, total student debt stands at just under $1.6 trillion. That sounds like a lot of money, but let\u2019s add some context.\nCredit Card Debt: $860 billion (link)\nAuto Debt: $1.46 trillion (link)\nMunicipal Debt: $3.3 trillion (link)\nHousing Debt: $11.25 trillion (link)\nCorporate Debt: $11.4 trillion (link)\nNational Debt: $30 trillion (link)\nI know that student loan borrowers don\u2019t have their own personal Federal Reserve to print off trillions of dollars and call is \u201cquantitative easing\u201d, but for a national market, $1.6 trillion isn\u2019t unrealistic (caveat: if wages kept up).\nAdditionally, unlike many other types of debt, no one can ever take away your education.\nAuto debt is funding a depreciating asset (current inflation notwithstanding), with no value creation.\nCredit card debt can fund a variety of items (mostly consumables), but the interest rates are extremely high.\nMortgage debt funds a normally appreciating asset, but one that also takes lots of money to maintain.\nSure, your wages might get garnished if you get really far behind and default, but the thing you bought will always be with you.\nThe Personal Impact\nJust like the overall size of student loan debt, the average student loan debt gets a lot of headlines. For recent graduates, that number is almost $38,000.\nBut that number is misleading, as the median student loan debt in 2019 was $17,000. The high debtors (like myself, with $135,000) are skewing the average to the high end.\nA similar issue exists with the monthly student loan payment. From a 2017 Federal Reserve research paper, \u201cThe average monthly payment among those currently in repayment is $393 with a median monthly payment of $222.\u201d\nWe can bump those numbers of to $275 and $500, but even this, this means that half of everyone repaying their student loans is paying $275 or less. That\u2019s a much smaller problem than everyone with student loans paying $500, as the (adjusted) average suggests.\nNow that we know the size of the problem, we need to discuss who it is affecting most.\nWho is Actually in Crisis?\nSurprisingly enough, those borrowers with the highest balances are not the ones we should be worried about. Sure, they may be six-figure student debt, but they are also much more likely to have six-figure salaries to deal with it.\nRather, those with the lowest student loan balances are the ones who are struggling the most with paying them off, specifically those who never graduated.\nSome College, No Degree\nThere is a well established relationship between educational attainment and lifetime earnings, which makes sense. In general, the more you know, the more valuable you are to the market. The big problem occurs when you take on student loan debt to get that education but never graduate.\nNow you\u2019ve got debt, and even some good education, but not a whole lot you can put on a resume. Employers don\u2019t really like to see and end date for your college education without a degree on the next line.\nSo now you\u2019re stuck in a low-paying job, paying off debt that didn\u2019t and won\u2019t give you anything in return, trying to figure out where the hell you went wrong.\nIt\u2019s a horrible situation to be in, and it\u2019s precisely where I found myself at age 21. For the three and a half years I was a college dropout, my student loans dogged the hell out of me, and I barely kept up.\nI was late. I was in forbearance. I was late again. I was in deferment. I paid on time, then I was late again. All the while I\u2019m stocking shelves during 2nd shift at WalMart to get that $0.50 shift differential, stewing in my own self-loathing that I would have had a ticket out of this hellhole of my own design had I just stayed in school.\nDropping out with student debt took a big mental and financial toll on me, and I\u2019m a white male who was single and childless at the time. Women, minorities, and adults with children are in far worse situations that I found myself due to lower pay, decreased opportunities due to increased responsibilities, and higher costs of future debt.\nThe issue is that this group is much larger than most people think, which is why it doesn\u2019t get the attention it deserves.\nThis might come as a surprise, but \u201c4-year institutions\u201d measure their graduation rates in 6-year increments. Said another way, universities who advertise the traditional four year schedule of Freshman through Senior allot six full years for students to complete their studies.\nHere\u2019s another surprise. The six-year graduation rate is around 63%, with just under half graduating from the same place they started.\nSo after six years, 37% of all freshman are either still in school (probably racking up more student loans), or they have dropped out. This is not a pretty picture of our current higher educational system.\nBachelor\u2019s Degree, Low Income\nThe next group of student loan borrowers who are in crisis are those who took out loans to complete their bachelor\u2019s degree but are stuck in low paying jobs.\nAs I touched on earlier, a bachelor\u2019s degree is a requirement for most current job postings, even if not required. This disqualifies all but the most dogged non-degree holders and attracts those with a bachelor\u2019s that are having a difficult time finding other work.\nWhen you are just starting your career after graduation, you generally get the advice that it doesn\u2019t matter what your first job is. Put in your time, pay your dues, and ultimately you\u2019ll make it.\nSo many new graduates take that advice to heart and take whatever job is offered, hoping for their dream job at the next company.\nHere\u2019s the problem: that advice is complete garbage because your starting salary is the baseline for all future salaries during your career.\nThere are been numerous studies showing the impact of a mere $5,000 increase in starting salary. Depending on the variables, you could be losing out on $1 million or more in lifetime earnings. This advice is especially impactful for women, who are dealing with the double whammy of already lower salaries and the (unduly placed) social expectation of not asking for a raise.\nSure, the first few years might suck trying to pay off your loan, even with that extra $5,000. However, just like investing in your retirement, negotiating a salary early and often in your career will pay off exponentially down the line.\nThe Sandwich Generation\nThis term is normally used when people in mid-life are trying to wrap up raising their kids but also end up taking care of their elderly parents earlier than expected. They are sandwiched between two generations.\nI apply this to student loans, except the parents are squeezing themselves. The advent of Parent PLUS loans helped create this mess.\nWhen looking at student loan balances by age, you generally see a downward trend, which makes sense. You\u2019ve been paying off your loan and are making more money, so why wouldn\u2019t the balance decrease?\nThe problem is when you look at student loan balances by age and by year. Balances have been increasing year-over-year for the past couple of decades for every age bracket.\nWhat\u2019s happening is that many parents, who are still trying to finish off their own loans, are now taking our Parent PLUS loans to help with their child(ren)\u2019s education. This is on top of sometimes also taking care of their own parents, adding another financial burden.\nWhat Can Be Done?\nWhile most people with student will ultimately be okay, there are way too many who won\u2019t. There are many proposals for a systemic overhaul of our higher ed system: anywhere from capping the cost of tuition to outright forgiving all student loans.\nAnything of that magnitude will either take time to implement or be subject to so much political partisanship that it will never see the light of day.\nThe biggest thing that would help out borrowers who just can\u2019t make the payments is relaxing the rules to discharge student debt in bankruptcy. For whatever reason, discharging student debt became frowned upon, and the regulations made it almost impossible to get any relief.\nHowever, I see student debt as a bet on yourself, just like companies that take out loans are betting on themselves to earn more money in the future to pay it back. If the company can\u2019t do it, they go bankrupt. If the person can\u2019t do it, they can go bankrupt, too.\nToo many people think bankruptcy is a financial death knell, or some kind of shameful deed to weasel your way out of money you didn\u2019t deserve. On the contrary, it\u2019s a basic part of finance, which, for individuals, is an emotionally retching experience.\nBankruptcy is no fun, and anyone who thinks people use it as their first option rather than their last resort have no idea what they\u2019re talking about.\nThe Takeaway\nI will be the first to agree that student loans are a pain. I\u2019ve been in one of the crisis groups and I did everything I could to get out. But there are too many people with too much debt who can\u2019t get out, so we need to offer them more options.\nFor the rest of us, the pain of student loans suck for a while, but one that is ultimately cured with a little bit of patience and the application of a lifetime of higher income potential.\nDon\u2019t take my word for it. The Social Security Administration calculated the net present value (NPV) of the lifetime earnings one can expect with a bachelor\u2019s degree.\nThe result?\nAn additional $260,000 for men and $180,000 for women. That pales in comparison to the NPV of just under $40,000 for the average loan.\nRemember, this is NPV, so it is in today\u2019s value of money. It is the equivalent of giving a stockbroker $40k in the morning and getting $260,000 later that afternoon.\nThat\u2019s a trade I\u2019ll make all day.\nRelated Stories\nBe Proud of Your Student Loans!\nA Simple Guide to Public Service Loan Forgiveness\n2 Decades, 2 Degrees, and 6 Figures Deep in Student Loan Debt\nDoes Family Size Effect Your Student Loan Payment?\nJoin Medium with my referral link - Angus Peterson\nAs a Medium member, a portion of your membership fee goes to writers you read, and you get full access to every story\u2026anguspeterson.medium.com", "comment_count": 11, "like_count": 92, "created_time": 1644887727032, "comment": [{"user_id": "61c2c2ba62bb", "comment_time": 1644887727032, "comment": "Thank you for sharing!"}, {"user_id": "49ed43fda80f", "comment_time": 1645418485272, "comment": "I went to a state college back when college was much, much cheaper and eventually paid of my student loans.

It gets worse when the rest of the world starts carping on us for our struggle.\nThe world is awash in negative press about the student loan crisis (link to article). While articles abound explaining the makeup of the $1.6 trillion in outstanding loans, many other articles (opinions, really) have been written passing judgement on those of us who decided to take out those loans.\nWe have been labelled entitled, lazy, stupid, naive, and a burden to the economy.\nAfter reading this garbage for years, we start to think that maybe we really were stupid for going to college. Maybe the loans will end up being a perpetual financial chain around necks, and we blew our one shot at making anything even remotely resembling a \u201cnormal\u201d American life.\nIt\u2019s easy to succumb to the constant barrage of negative stereotypes, especially when we\u2019re young and our financial situation hasn\u2019t exactly panned out the way we had hoped.\nHowever, I say we should start celebrating our student loans as our financial red badge of courage, showing the world that we took a chance at a better life via higher education.\nWe took a chance at changing our lives, resisting the siren song of resignation to 40 years of the same old job with the same old pay. Or as Kacey Musgraves would say, to avoid the, \u201c Same checks we\u2019re always cashin\u2019. To buy a little more distraction.\u201d\nWe wanted better for us, for our spouse, for our kids, and for our grandkids.\nWe wanted to be the keystone to building that ever important generational family wealth that has benefited thousands of our college peers, but we were never able to take part of.\nSome of us have realized our dreams, but with more debt than we ever imagined.\nSome of us dropped out, stopped out, or simply ran out of money and have thousands of dollars to pay off for just a few college credits.\nRegardless of where you are, let\u2019s get one thing straight: you should be proud of your student loans. You took a gamble on yourself, which is more than many people can claim.\nWhat is Shame?\nOne of the worst parts about the student loan crisis is the degradation in the mental health of student loan borrowers.\nYou might be different, but not a day goes by that I don\u2019t think about my student loans, and I\u2019m one of the lucky ones. My wife and I both have salaried jobs with good benefits and flexible work schedules. We\u2019re also both on track for PSLF in the next 4-ish years.\nBut until we see a balance of $0, I\u2019ve still got $135,000 of debt assigned to my name, and my wife has another $40,000.\nOthers aren\u2019t anywhere near as lucky, and they can start to change their identity to fit the narrative that they are \u201cless than\u201d for taking on student debt.\nIn short, their guilt has turned to shame.\nFor the definition of both, we need to turn to one of my wife\u2019s favorite authors, Brene Brown.\nGuilt is, \u201cI did something bad.\u201d Shame is, \u201cI am bad.\u201d\nGuilt is, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I made a mistake.\u201d Shame is, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I am a mistake.\u201d\nThe difference is sometimes subtle, but the impact is devastating.\nGuilt can be a good thing, acting as our internal compass when we\u2019ve made a mistake and need to make amends.\nShame, however, can be outright crippling (I should know\u2026I\u2019ve been dealing with shame for other reasons for years) and can seriously impact everything from job performance and friendships to marriages and physical health.\nSo what are the sources of this shame and how can we deal with it?\nFinancial Shame\nFinancial shame starts with not being able to afford going out with your friends, but the spiral can deepen very quickly.\nWhen you have student loan payments that eat a gigantic chunk out of your paycheck, I\u2019m not talking about the financial shame of keeping up with the Joneses and buying a better sports car.\nNo, I\u2019m talking about not affording to go out to eat once a month at Applebee\u2019s with your family, or being unable to drop $30 on some happy hour drinks with your coworkers, or being too broke to spend a lazy Saturday afternoon with some cheap outfield lawn seats at a AAA baseball game.\nWhen you can\u2019t even afford the simple things in life, you start to question your self worth. And the financial problems can get much worse.\nStudent loans increase your debt-to-income ratio, making it harder to secure a mortgage. Now, you\u2019re missing out on the housing boom, which could have toppled the first domino of your generational wealth goal.\nSo instead of putting 10% down on a 30 year mortgage, you go for a 3% down 7-year ARM, which has a much higher chance of blowing up your finances, further deepening your shame.\nSocial Shame\nThis is linked to financial shame by not being able to afford the same goods or services as your neighbors, but having student loans also acts as a signal to others that you weren\u2019t \u201cenough\u201d.\nYour family wasn\u2019t rich enough to outright pay for college.\nYou weren\u2019t smart enough to get a full ride.\nYou weren\u2019t disciplined enough to become a Resident Assistant and have your room and board paid for.\nYou high school wasn\u2019t good enough to offer college credit classes.\nYou weren\u2019t grounded enough to choose a high-ROI major.\nIf any of these sounds familiar, you might be feeling a lot like Mirabel from Encanto, finally realizing that she and her sisters were never enough for their grandmother.\nInternal Shame\nThis is the internalized shame that quite possibly no one has brought up, except you. It originates from not meeting your own personal expectations from your childhood.\nThese expectations may have been written in a journal during high school. They may have just existed in your head but never spoken out loud. They may even be in your subconscious, implanted by years of indoctrination from family, movies, or whatever.\nMaybe you thought you would never get student loans, but here you: six figures deep in debt.\nMaybe you thought you would pay off your loans in a quick 10 years, but here you are, more than 20 years later with a hefty balance.\nMaybe you thought you would start your marriage on strong financial ground, but here you are with a $800 monthly payment.\nRooting out these unmet personal expectations might be the hardest type of shame to dismantle, since they can be so closely tied to our identity. Our goals become us, and our lack of achievement defines us.\nThis is the type of shame that counseling can help address (among a vast array of other issues).\nThe Good Side of Student Loan Debt\nEarlier I mentioned that the mere fact that you took a chance on yourself is reason enough to be proud of your student loans, and it absolutely it.\nThe good news is that there are even more reasons to be proud of your student debt.\nBuilding Resilience\nFirst, you have realized that life never gives you what you planned. You have debt, probably more than you planned, and you needed to adjust your life to this new reality.\nYou\u2019ve encountered a speed bump in life, and now you know you can handle it. This builds resilience, grit, and determination. It\u2019s not everyday that you end up tens of thousands of dollars in debt, and it takes a strong mind to overcome it.\nIf you don\u2019t believe me, think of all the times you\u2019ve had to deal with your student loan servicer, correcting their mistakes or practicing the patience of Job to get an issue escalated (FedLoan anyone?). Learning to work the student loan system is a crash course in all the official government BS you\u2019ll have to put up with your entire life.\nExperiences and Education\nStudent loans are sometimes the first big \u201cpurchase\u201d we make in life, at least it was for me.\nI bought my first car for $1,200 (my mom kicked in the last $300) when I was 17. It was a beautiful 1984 Chevy Celebrity with crushed velvet interior and peeling tint on the windows, formerly owned by two 70-something sisters who didn\u2019t need a second car anymore.\nIt was beautiful, and it was mine.\nFast forward 9 months, and I\u2019m signing on the dotted line to borrow $5,000 to help pay my first year tuition at college, so I guess my loans were the second big purchase. However, while that \u201984 Celebrity is probably in a parts yard by now, I still have memories from that first year that I\u2019ll take with me to my grave.\nWas it worth still paying off that first year loan after 20+ years? Maybe. But I know that I wouldn\u2019t be the person I am today if I hadn\u2019t enrolled.\nFinancial Education\nYour perception of your student loans might range from mild irritation to complete hate, but regardless of your emotion, you have experienced some level of buyer\u2019s remorse.\nI know I just mentioned that both the experiences from college and the education attained were worth it, but I also admit that I could have done a better job of financing my education. So yeah, I have some level of buyer\u2019s remorse.\nThe good news is that now you know what it feels like and can avoid it in the future.\nSome people don\u2019t experience this kind of financial headache until they buy a house they can\u2019t get out of, and very rarely can they parlay that house into more money.\nStudent loans, and the education they bought, can teach you what a bad deal is while still giving you something at least minimally valuable in the process.\nThe Takeaway\nKnowing what I know now, knowing what I knew then, would I have still made the same decision regarding my student loans?\nDefinitely not.\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean that I wouldn\u2019t have taken out student loans at all. My undergrad loans were a mistake, as I had to opportunity to minimize or outright eliminate them completely.\nHowever, my graduate loans would probably be the same, as I had a family to support during business school with little to no extra money for tuition.\nBottom line: be proud of taking a chance on yourself. It doesn\u2019t matter if it was a miracle, you crashed and burned, or somewhere in between. You took a risk, so stand up and own it.\nRelated Articles\nA Simple Guide to Public Service Loan Forgiveness\n2 Decades, 2 Degrees, and 6 Figures Deep in Student Loan Debt\nIs There Really a Student Loan Crisis?\nDoes Family Size Effect Your Student Loan Payment?\nJoin Medium with my referral link - Angus Peterson\nAs a Medium member, a portion of your membership fee goes to writers you read, and you get full access to every story\u2026anguspeterson.medium.com", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 51, "created_time": 1646056014085, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Student Loans", "Debt", "Money", "Personal Finance", "College"]}, {"author": "Laura Khoudari", "post_id": "3f4b7f5d3b33", "user_id": "56bf57dcc2cf", "title": "Why 'Take a Deep Breath' Can Be Terrible Advice", "content": "The field of trauma treatment is rapidly growing, which means that as a trauma-informed strength coach, I spend a lot of time studying different clinical approaches. And as I do, I witness countless yoga teachers, therapists, somatic therapists, massage therapists, and physical therapists telling the stressed out to take a nice deep breath to get grounded. To this I say: STOP! Please do not insist folks take a deep breath.\nOn the surface, it makes a lot of sense to tell people to take a deep breath. We commonly think of deep breathing as a way to slow down time, our breath, and ultimately our autonomic nervous system. But guess what \u2014 lots of people with chronic stress, post-traumatic stress disorder, or complex post-traumatic stress disorder, will find this act at best, damn near impossible, and at worst, triggering.\nConstriction in Our Breathing Muscles\nIf you live with chronic stress or trauma, there is a good chance that you experience constriction in your primary breathing muscle \u2014 the diaphragm.\n\nThe diaphragm is a muscle beneath your ribcage that contracts and flattens out to fill your lungs with air. As you exhale, it relaxes and expands upward. When we are breathing at rest in a parasympathetic state, it should handle most of the work.\nWorking in conjunction with the diaphragm is a whole set of secondary breathing muscles \u2014 your intercostals, scalenes, sternocleidomastoids, pecs minor, and abs.\nMuscles of respiration. Source: Physiopedia/Public domain\nThese muscles are of your neck, chest, and belly. And theoretically when you are at rest, they are too. Even when you are working hard in a sympathetic state, they are only handling some of the load. That said, if you live with chronic stress or trauma these muscles are often overused, and your diaphragm does almost none of the work.\nAlthough I had experienced this in my own body, my teacher, Jane Clapp, was the first person I heard speak to this phenomenon. During her Movement for Trauma program, she spoke to the potentially triggering nature of working with the breath and the importance of breathing through the nose. This would go on to inform a lot of what I do with myself and others.\nImagine you are hiking and you see a bear or some other predator you find threatening. Sense into your body. What does it feel like? What are your muscles doing? It is likely your whole trunk is constricted. This is a life-or-death situation, and your limbic system has taken the reins and is going to do its damnedest to save you with some defensive mobilization or immobilization.\nNow I am going to ask you to imagine that you are running late for a very important meeting, and you are stuck in traffic or on a stopped subway train without cell service. You are going to miss something very important and have no way to let the others know. Sense into your body. What is your breathing like, and where are you breathing from? Is any air making it into your belly? Probably not. Your whole trunk is constricted even though this is not a life-and-death situation \u2014 it is just very stressful.\nIn both cases \u2014 actual life or death, and perceived to be life or death \u2014 you braced. And even when that bear runs off, and that train starts to move again, your diaphragm will probably still be constricted with the lingering stress. Many of us don\u2019t realize that we have not relaxed our diaphragms and that we are always bracing our primary breathing muscle to some extent.\nI work as a beginning strength coach with the general population in New York City, and I can tell you that for the most part, New Yorkers are a bunch of chest-breathers hustling and living in a very stimulating environment. It is common for people living with trauma, or simply with a lot of stress, to be stuck in a defensive state \u2014 fight or flight. Their trunks are always bracing just a little, and that diaphragm rarely gets the chance to move.\nWhat happens to muscles that have not been moved? That\u2019s right \u2014 they get stiff and eventually weak. It does not feel good when you become keenly aware that your muscles are stiff and weak. Telling a constricted person to take a deep breath invites them to realize just how tight everything is inside. For some people that may be okay, but for others \u2014 people like me \u2014 it can feel terrifying. It can feel claustrophobic, suffocating, and absolutely triggering. Deep breaths are a goal for folks like us \u2014 not the starting place.\nAlternatives to Telling People to Take a Deep Breath\nThe good news is that there are countless alternatives to get grounded, present, and mindful of the body. The following are a few techniques you can use rather than going straight for the breath.\nNeutral Places in the Body\nAsk your client to tune into the body and find a place that feels neutral. Encourage the client to put the attention there. Neutrality is often found in places like the hands or the seat. People might feel funny that their butt feels good, but it often does. Let them get grounded by feeling into a part of their body that feels supported and easy, rather than going straight for the center.\nWhen I began to incorporate mindfulness meditation into my own treatment, I realized that the only place that felt safe to focus on was my hands. So that is where I started. Only after many months of daily sitting, as well as using other healing modalities, was I able to move to focusing on the breath.\nFive Things\nFor some folks, turning inward at all is dysregulating. Suddenly becoming aware of your state can be quite jarring at times. For clients who cannot ground by looking for resources inward, I ask them to become situated and present by looking around and naming five blue things, five red things, and five yellow things. It gets people to closely look at their environment and keeps their prefrontal cortex turned on as opposed to triggering an emotionally reactive limbic response.\nSounds Far to Near, Near to Far\nIf I am encouraging someone to turn inward I will ask the person to first listen for sounds far away \u2014 people talking outside, wind, cars \u2014 and then closer sounds like water running through the pipes or cooking sounds in the kitchen, and then even sounds from inside of that person\u2019s own body. If I am trying to bring someone\u2019s awareness back outside of the body, I encourage the same process but in reverse \u2014 starting nearby and opening up to sounds far away.\nIf Breath is the Main Driver of Your Practice\nAnd if breath is the main driver of your practice like in yoga or certain mindfulness meditation practices, you can suggest the client follow the breath without manipulation. By being behind the breath (following it), the constriction can feel less stifling than being on top of it (focusing on it). But please keep in mind that for some people, following or focusing on the breath is a goal, not a tool to be employed right in that moment.\nGetting the Diaphragm Moving Again\nLastly, if you work with the body you can help your client get the diaphragm moving again when they are ready. In strength sports we use a diaphragmatic breath and valsalva \u2014 a forced exhalation \u2014 to brace for each lift. Singers, musicians, dancers, and yogis all use the diaphragm extensively. My coach, Jesse Irizarry, taught me how to teach people to brace to lift. I couple his technique with a gentle inhale to be sure the diaphragm moves. This is how I instruct every person I work with to brace:\nPlace your hands on your waist like a weightlifting belt so you can feel as you bring air into your belly.\nBreathe in softly and slowly through the nose, until you fill with air. By breathing through the nose we are going to encourage the use of the diaphragm over the secondary breathing muscles. We are also limiting how much air comes in at once, telling the nervous system it is okay to stay relaxed. A sudden gasp for air will signal to the body it is \u201cgo time\u201d and activate a sympathetic response. The body will brace again, and this will defeat the purpose of this exercise.\nAt this point, many clients realize how hard it is for them to breathe this way. I reassure them that, yes, it is hard and comes with practice \u2014 and we are going to practice with every rep. (If clients are worrying that they won\u2019t be able to take a diaphragmatic breath it will limit their ability to do so!)\nWe do this exercise a couple of times together, me showing just how big I can get my belly and how even my thumbs on my back move as air fills my back, not just the front. There is often some giggling because it looks so odd for anyone to so publicly expand the stomach. This giggling is good \u2014 we are having fun! In general, after about five breaths the client will see progress in getting increased air into the lower abdomen.\nDeep Breaths as a Goal\nYes, now after years of diaphragmatic breathing, I can take a deep breath without panicking, simply because I can take a deep breath at all. But it took work. On behalf of the constricted breathers who panic when they notice their constriction, I am going to ask you to not start with the breath when working with trauma. Get creative or use the tools I listed above, but start somewhere safer, or possibly outside of the body completely.", "comment_count": 20, "like_count": 5301, "created_time": 1529928428059, "comment": [{"user_id": "56bf57dcc2cf", "comment_time": 1529928428059, "comment": "Thank you for sharing!"}, {"user_id": "d489995f21cd", "comment_time": 1530129430582, "comment": "Thank you.

I spend a lot of time before school, after school, and on the weekends doing mom kinds of things like answering questions about homework, listening to stories, making meals, and generally trying to be available to help when needed. I know my daughter\u2019s friends, teachers, what she is learning, and what she enjoys. I help her prepare for extra-curricular activities and I attend her performances.\nAs involved as I am, there is one category of thing that I don\u2019t do and I feel a little bad about it. I don\u2019t do PTA things. Somewhere along the line, I internalized the idea that a good parent is very involved in their child\u2019s PTA which means some part of me also thinks that therefore, I am a bad parent.\nAlmost every Sunday I \u201cshould\u201d myself when I receive and read an email with a list of opportunities to be more involved in my daughter\u2019s school. I start thinking that I should do these things even though my schedule is packed, I feel full, I don\u2019t want to, my daughter doesn\u2019t care if I do it or not, and the school has enough parents who want to be there.\nMy inner critic makes passing on these opportunities hard, but I usually pass in honor of the boundaries I have in place around my time and energy. I don\u2019t just say \u201cno\u201d without consideration. Each week when I read the list of parent activities, I make sure to not only pay attention to \u201cthe shoulds,\u201d but to also pay attention to how my body feels and what it does. Do I lean towards the screen when I read about any of the offerings? If so, when I look at my calendar to see if I\u2019m available, do I still lean toward the computer or do I pull back? Leaning in means I want to do it, leaning back means we\u2019ve hit a boundary. When I feel my body contract, I know it is because it is trying to protect me and in this case my resources. That is what my boundary feels like.\nHow To Know Your Boundaries\nBoundaries are a big topic in the wellness world. Whether you listen to weekly astrology podcasts, read advice columns, or explore them with your therapist, you are likely to come across a call to \u201chonor your boundaries.\u201d When you read or hear that sort of advice, you might think:\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s good advice,\u201d or \u201cOh, I\u2019m so bad at boundaries.\u201d\nBut have you ever thought, \u201cHow do I know my boundaries?\u201d\nHonoring your boundaries is great advice, but you can\u2019t honor your boundaries in the moment if you don\u2019t know what your boundaries are and what they feel like.\nBut have you ever thought, \u201chow do I know my boundaries?\u201d\nYour boundaries are where you end and the rest of the energetic, emotional, and physical world begins. Your skin contains your skeleton and viscera, your energy field contains your energetic being, and your emotional field contains your emotions. And you know your boundaries by feeling them.\nHonoring your boundaries means noticing and heeding signals from your nervous system that something is either too much or not safe for you at that moment; and that something doesn\u2019t have to be life-threatening. It can be receiving an invitation to an event or meeting when you are already too darn busy, being asked an intrusive question by a well-meaning friend, or being egged on by a coach to do one more rep of an exercise when you know you don\u2019t have enough energy to do it safely.\nBeing attuned to your boundaries is like having self-care-spidey-sense. Feeling something come up against your boundaries might hurt like when you are come close to your limit in the gym or it may be more subtle signals that tell you someone or something has gone too far with you in a physical or emotional way.\n(To get a better sense of how boundaries might feel to you specifically, I invite you to try out the exercise I provide in \u201cGet To Know Your Boundaries.\u201d)\nGet To Know Your Boundaries\nAn 8-week series of practical exercises and skill building to support your mental health throughout the holiday seasonlaura-khoudari.medium.com\nHonoring your boundaries means that in moments of choice, you listen to your spidey-sense and say \u201cno\u201d or remove yourself from situations that don\u2019t feel right. This includes the times in life when it might be hard (but not impossible) to say no to someone or awkward to remove yourself from something.\nWhy You Might Be Out of Touch With Your Boundaries\nIf you are disconnected (or dissociated) from your body chances are you will not notice that your boundaries are being infringed upon in the moment and there are all sorts of reason you may tend to dissociate. You may have had to to survive ongoing threats like discrimination or food insecurity in the past or in the present. Or you may have regularly overridden signals that you are hungry, tired, or need to relieve yourself for any number of reasons. Or maybe you always pick up the slack at work without extra compensation even if you already feel overwhelmed, or you are the sort to sign up for some sort of volunteer thing even though some part of you says not to? In each of these scenarios you disconnect from your body to some degree so you can keep on keeping on. And honestly that\u2019s okay to do on occasion. Sometimes you have to in override your body\u2019s signals to get stuff done. But I urge you to then make time to reconnect.\nIn many of these cases we don\u2019t realize we aren\u2019t honoring our boundaries until we feel consequences such as exhaustion, resentment, or pain. If this is you, it may be time to start engaging in a regular embodied movement practice to increase the likelihood of noticing your boundaries so you can honor them.\nPractice Makes Better\nEmbodied or mindful movement practices are the best way to practice noticing sensations that arise from your body including your your boundary related ones. Qigong, the Feldenkrais Method, the Alexander Technique, and certain types of yoga are explicitly referred to as embodied movement practices. This is because, when done as intended, the person practicing them pays attention to their interoceptive experience, or what it feels like in their body as they move. What makes a mindful movement practice isn\u2019t the movement itself, but where you put your attention as you do the movement. The object of your focus then is what it feels like in your body as you engage in practice. Staying with that object mentally makes the practice mindful and inherently embodied. What this means is that you can do this type of mindfulness practice with any movement you already do in your day.\nIn my article How to Start a Mindfulness Practice Without Having to Find More Time, and the accompanying recording, I walk you through turning any physical chore, movement, or exercise you do regularly (for example walking the dog or to work, carrying groceries, washing the dishes, or working out) into an embodied movement practice.\nHow to Start a Mindfulness Practice Without Having to Find More Time\nPart of an 8-week series of practical exercises and skill building to support your mental health throughout the holiday\u2026laura-khoudari.medium.com\nBy practicing paying attention to how your body feels at a set time and safe place you are more likely to notice your body and how it feels at other times of day including when you are faced with a choice that comes up against a boundary. That\u2019s how I know its okay to say no (or the occasional yes) to all of the opportunities afforded me in my Sunday email from my daughter\u2019s school no matter what my inner critic is saying.\nAnd while it can be uncomfortable in the moment to say no or to walk away, recognizing and enforcing your boundaries can help preserve your mental and physical health and well-being for the long haul.\nIf you learned something from reading my story, why not follow me here on Medium and you can also sign up to have my stories delivered straight to your inbox.\nGet an email whenever Laura Khoudari publishes.\nGet an email whenever Laura Khoudari publishes.

In slowing down to write about them you can unwind them, and loosen tight couplings that don\u2019t actually belong together. It is from that place of thoughtful introspection and new understanding that you can grow, shift, and heal in a manner that synthesizes emotional memory with critical thought. Writing about anything difficult from our past, as either a personal practice or for an audience can be an opportunity to process and heal \u2014 if done in a way that feels safe and honors your boundaries. By slowing down, staying present in your body, and putting language to thoughts, memories, and emotions that might otherwise be swirling around in your head, you can spend time examining and making meaning of the felt experience of moments, both big and small, that shaped you.\nBut like all healing work, writing about trauma thoughtfully isn\u2019t easy and it needs to be done with intention.\nIn my book, Lifting Heavy Things: Healing Trauma One Rep at a Time I lead readers step-by-step through the process of creating an intentional, healing, embodied, and trauma-informed movement practice, just like I would with a private client. My approach comprises three parts \u2014 Conditions, Activation, and Recovery \u2014 that, when done in order, can be used to structure a trauma-sensitive movement and writing practice which will yield work that is healing to both read and write.\nI recently published a story about writing Lifting Heavy Things with a trauma-informed approach. In \u201cOn (Not) Writing About Your Trauma,\u201d I define trauma-informed writing as both a process and a product that tends to the nervous system of both writer and reader so that all parties are more likely to stay present for the experience of the written work. It is self-aware of both how the writer approaches their writing practice and in understanding how their words may impact their readers.\nOn (Not) Writing Your Trauma\nA Trauma-Informed Personal Trainer\u2019s Approach To Sharing Your Story Thoughtfullylaura-khoudari.medium.com\nConditions\nBefore you do any heavy lifting in the gym, you have to prepare. For me that means I review my program and collect my gear for the day. The same could be said before you write \u2014 you need to put a few conditions in place for the work to be fruitful. You will want to know why you are writing, because holding an intention can help you stay grounded, whether you\u2019re writing for an assignment or free writing. Holding this intention can help you recognize if your writing begins to spiral out or you become overwhelmed. It also helps to gather what you need to make your writing practice supportive and sustainable. Literary coach and creator of the Narrative Healing program, Lisa Weinert, asks writers to consider things like time of day, type of environment, tools (specific pens, your favorite pillows, a comfy chair), and anything else that comes to mind.\nFor me, getting grounded involves a few particular practices and conditions. I honor that I need quiet to stay focused and I also need others close by to remind me that I am supported. This has looked like working in a co-working space, where I\u2019m among dozens of others wearing noise-canceling headphones, or writing in my home office that shares a wall with my husband, who also works from home. I elect to work in places with natural light and often bring a cup of coffee, water, and sometimes a crystal. I also keep a clock nearby. All of these items bring me comfort, like a grown up\u2019s security blanket.\nThe view from my desk where I do most of my writing at home.\nIf you are currently writing about something challenging from your past or present, I invite you to take stock of the conditions you need in place to feel supported as you write. Ask yourself what do you need to feel safe and comfortable in your environment and what helps you feel grounded or regulated when you begin to become overwhelmed?\nActivation\nThe second section of Lifting Heavy Things is Activation. This is when we get moving and, specifically in my work, practice embodied or mindful movement. In the context of strength training, mindful movement may mean focusing on my bicep contracting and extending while doing a bicep curl, or noticing what my foot is doing while I challenge my standing balance. Intentionally bringing your attention to the felt experience of lifting heavy things while you train turns exercise into a moving meditation and also helps you move better. It also affords you the opportunity to practice staying in your body while under stress. Stress isn\u2019t inherently bad and exercise is a stressor!\nJust as staying embodied as you train, especially when it\u2019s hard, makes for better form, staying embodied as you write, especially about trauma, can make for better writing. Trauma is not just an emotional experience, it is physiological. We feel our feelings in our body, we don\u2019t think them. In order to bring your audience into the experience with you, you are going to want to capture the sensations of that moment. One of the hardest parts about writing about the past is that when we go back to memories in our mind our body conjures up the feelings we had then, now. So I pay special attention to things that remind me of being present, which goes hand-in-hand with self-awareness.\nOne of the aforementioned conditions I need for writing is to have a clock in my line of sight. I rely on it to stay aware of how much time has passed as I write. Some people use alarms or timers. For me keeping track of the time more passively with the occasional glance is enough of a cue for me to pause every twenty to thirty minutes to move my body a little bit and take in the sights, sounds, and smells around me. This reminds me that while I am visiting the past in writing, I am not actually there.\nTo better understand what I mean by this, I invite you to bring to mind a funny thing that happened recently. Really remember the moment: where you were, who you were with, and what was funny. Now notice what you feel in your body and what your body is doing right now. Are you smiling? Are you subtly mimicking the posture you take when you laugh? If I was a betting woman I would say you are. When I think about something funny my whole face feels brighter as if it lights up. I can feel it. My lips curl into a smile. My eyebrows raise and my brow wrinkles. I\u2019m experiencing this memory in my body, as much as in my mind.\nWe can experience painful memories in our bodies in the same way when we call them up to write. But the difference is, those feelings are likely unpleasant to some degree \u2014 fear, grief, shame \u2014 and are harder to sit with.That\u2019s why sense checks can be so supportive to remembering you are safe in the present moment. You do this by pausing periodically and taking in your environment.\nI come into my body before I write and periodically throughout a writing session by noticing the seat below me and then by scanning my body to see what I feel. And if a sensation is too big to be with, I pause and come back to the present through my senses. If that is not enough, I get up and interact with another person. I don\u2019t always disclose that I am discombobulated or upset. I just say, \u201cHi,\u201d which is almost like an acknowledgment to myself \u2014 \u201dHello, Laura, I am here and now, not in my memory.\u201d And if and when I feel ready, I sit back down and continue getting curious about what it is like to go back to that moment.\nTrauma-informed work spends small and tolerable amounts of time in small and tolerable amounts of the trauma experience, over time. When something was traumatic it was either too much process or happened too fast to process in the moment. Therefore in order to process it without retraumatizing yourself you need to go at a pace that is not too fast, and work with a small bit of the story that would otherwise be too much. In Lifting Heavy Things I invite the reader to pause and tend to themselves throughout the book the same way I program rests between sets in the gym.\nRecovery\nIn the third and final section of Lifting Heavy Things, I write about recovery from exercise and what recovery from trauma can look like outside of the gym. As we recover from trauma, our relationships begin to shift and a lot of the time that is due to our increased capacity to be aware of and enforce our boundaries.\nKnowing and honoring your boundaries when you write is a big part of producing trauma-informed written work. It is also important whenever you share parts of your life in your work. One reason I write is to feel seen and heard, which can feel good but can also be scary.\nIn order to respect your boundaries you must know where they are. You know them by feeling them. When I am asked in conversation to disclose something that I don\u2019t want to, I know it because there is a sensation of armoring in my chest, the muscles of my face and neck tighten. I constrict. My body is holding onto that story for the moment. And that\u2019s okay.\nAre you curious as to how you might experience your boundaries? I invite you to feel your boundaries right now with this exercise:\nTake a moment to settle in your seat wherever you are. Notice your body being supported by whatever is beneath your feet, seat, and back. Then bring to mind someone who you would rather not receive a hug from. Maybe they are someone you find annoying or they are stinky or sweaty. Now imagine them coming in to hug you. What does your body do? That reflex is your body feeling and demonstrating a boundary.\nIf you write personal narratives, next time you practice, consider checking in and noticing how your body is experiencing the moment. Is it constricted or resisting somewhere, or is it open? In noticing you are on your way to a more self-aware and powerful writing practice.\nWhen you are done writing, close your practice. Maybe you have a ritual like closing all the programs on your computer or putting away your notebook in a drawer or on your shelf. Perhaps now you sit down to lunch. Whatever it is, engage in a ritual that tells your body you are done with your writing practice for now.\nWith these three considerations in mind, you can take care of yourself while writing from your more personal and tender places. This may ultimately turn your writing practice into a healing practice for you and your readers.\nIf you learned something from reading my story, why not follow me here on Medium and you can also sign up to have my stories delivered straight to your inbox.\nGet an email whenever Laura Khoudari publishes.\nGet an email whenever Laura Khoudari publishes.

My book, Lifting Heavy Things: Healing Trauma One Rep at a Time, is a guide to turning any movement practice into a healing practice. It combines personal narrative, research, and practical exercises. Despite being both niche and cross-genre, It reached number one on Amazon\u2019s \u201cPain Management\u201d and \u201cWeight Training\u201d lists and was among the top ten books for \u201cHealing.\u201d It was featured by NPR and has garnered international attention and support from trauma and fitness organizations. And yet, the thing that one might expect to find in this kind of book \u2014 my personal trauma story, the reason for my coming to this work and keeping up with it for seven years \u2014 is nowhere to be found. Instead, my trauma story takes up all of two characters, set against a beautiful blank page:\n[ ]\nThere is a lot of value in sharing one\u2019s trauma story in a safe way with people you trust. But that kind of disclosure is not my approach to teaching and coaching from a trauma-informed way, so I felt no need to change my routine in the context of a book. In that sense, I\u2019ve come to attribute the book\u2019s success in a large part to the fact that I am authentic to my practice in my writing, and hopefully recreate what it might feel to have a movement practice with those elements.\nWhat Happens Without A Trauma Informed Approach\nBringing a trauma-informed approach to all my work is imperative because I am teaching people who are coping with trauma about trauma itself; the very word \u201ctrauma\u201d tends to stir up feelings that can be dysregulating to anyone. When that happens, a reader or client won\u2019t be able to take in the information they are seeking from me because that nervous system dysregulation reduces their capacity for critical thought.\nHave you ever read a book or even a social media post that hit close to home and suddenly found it hard to focus or afterwards felt like you must go straight to sleep? Those are signs of being overwhelmed by the experience of reading.\nWhen you get overwhelmed by feelings, the survivalist part of your brain, called the limbic system, prepares you to fight, freeze, or flee \u2014 also known as the stress response. When the limbic system takes over your body, another part of the brain, the prefrontal cortex responsible for higher-level thinking, goes offline, like a flipping a light switch. Without the input from the prefrontal cortex, essential functions for processing trauma such as critical thought, attentiveness, and memory aren\u2019t available. It may not seem like it, but this is a good design. It allows you to process the situation and respond faster than you can with the higher thinking parts of your brain; speed is important when you need to act fast to stay safe and say run from a bear or jump out of the way of an oncoming vehicle. The problem arises when you are dealing with something less dire like reading a book that is reminding you of past events, and your limbic system responds as if you are at risk of being back there or are back there.\nI want my readers to be able to stay present and thoughtful while reading. I want them to feel seen, recognized, and as if they are gaining tools from reading what I have written. I also want to feel safe and grounded when I share myself with the world.\nWhat We Are Doing in a Trauma-Informed Approach\nTrauma-informed writing tends to the nervous system of both writer and reader so that all parties are more likely to stay present for the experience of the written work. It\u2019s self-aware of both how the writer approaches their writing practice and in understanding how their words may impact their readers. Keeping this in mind makes my writing a more enjoyable and healing experience both in its practice and consumption, because neither my audience nor I winds up stewing in unprocessed emotions and mental disorganization.\nIf you are writing about trauma for yourself or for an audience, self-awareness is fundamental to keeping the act a safe and healing experience for all parties. For example, self-awareness enables me to know when to make space to pause both as writer and reader, when to ask for critical feedback and receive it, allows me feel safe to be my authentic self in a public forum, and it helped me produce a published work that is in alignment with my personal and professional values.\nWhether you are writing a personal essay you hope to publish or are posting about an experience on social media, if you do so without self-awareness you expose yourself to reactions you may not be ready for and readers are left feeling stirred up without resolution or any lessons learned.\n\nHonor Your Boundaries and Remember Your Reader\nBefore I wrote Lifting Heavy Things I was nervous. I really wanted writing this book to be a safe experience for me. Later I realized that in doing so I would be making a better book to read. With the help of a literary coach and my therapist I prioritized self awareness \u2014 starting with my own boundaries around writing and sharing. By reading first drafts of what I had written it was you can tell when I was less self-aware as I wrote. My writing suffered\u2014 it was confusing and disorganized. Lisa Weinert, my literary coach would read a draft and ask, \u201chow long did you sit and write for? Did you take a break?\u201d She could tell I hadn\u2019t paused and come up for air and out of my own experience. That approach is fine for journaling but not for writing for an audience\u2014especially if you want your audience to learn from you.\nWhen I look at those drafts, I can see how it would be upsetting and confusing to read what I wrote when I wasn\u2019t practicing good self-care. I was writing about some really hard times in my life. In my book I explore challenging topics such as trauma, self-esteem, body image issues, chronic pain, and injury. Going forward as I wrote and rewrote passages I explored the edges of my own boundaries and then I respected them. In doing so I was able to produce a book that connected with others while I tended to both my and my audience\u2019s nervous system. The first step in doing this is honoring your own boundaries around what it is you are ready to share.\nThe biggest example of this is that I chose not to share my own trauma story. I have never shared my story publicly and in continuing to respect my own privacy I am honoring my own boundaries. And I am modeling how people can be on multiple platforms helping others and can also get help without disclosing any story that they wish to keep private. While yes, we need to confide our trauma story to someone who will meet use with empathy and hold space for us, we do not have to share it repeatedly, nor publicly, not even when seeking support with trauma symptoms.

I attach their rightful meaning to them, and I try to use my own carefully. When my ex-husband recently suggested that I get a full-time job, I wondered aloud who would pick up our ten year-old daughter from school every afternoon.\n\u201cI will!\u201d he said, enthusiastically. \u201cI would love to babysit for her.\u201d\n\u201cBut you can\u2019t, because you have to be the father,\u201d I said pointedly. He shrugged, not caring about this nuance.\nI\u2019ve been a stay-home mom for close to twenty years, so it\u2019s inconceivable that I would ever make this slip-up in language. What disconnect would you have to have from your role as a parent to make this verbal mistake?\nLater in the conversation, I insulted him by calling her \u201cmy\u201d daughter. I had done this with some regularity earlier in our separation, but after he pointed out to me how offensive it was to him, I made an effort to call the kids \u201cours\u201d and not just \u201cmine.\u201d When I did on occasion err, I was quick to apologize.\nThis time, I pointed out the inconsistency, \u201cYou just called yourself the babysitter, so I was confused.\u201d\nSo why, if I claim to be circumspect when I speak, would my slip of the tongue be an innocent mistake while his slip suggests a detachment from his role?\nPerhaps my slip was less an innocent mistake than an actual belief that our three children feel more mine than ours? After devoting myself full-time to their care \u2014 knowing all their friends and teachers, having long ago committed their pediatrician\u2019s phone number to memory, writing over and over again in the most tidy handwriting to fill in all the requested info on the schools\u2019 emergency blue cards \u2014 didn\u2019t they belong more to me than they ever would to him?\nI can make arguments either way. He is their sole financial provider, so based on that alone, they wouldn\u2019t be able to survive for long without him. And he loves them deeply, thinking about their well-being, stretching to pay for anything they need. He is not the person they turn to for friendship advice or to request the Amazon login for the hundredth time or to edit school papers, but if they called him for help, he would earnestly try.\nOn the other hand, at times when the kids are with me, I text him a question related to them and he doesn\u2019t respond to me for hours, or check in to see how college or camp or first day of school drop-off was. I cannot imagine a universe in which I would not be present for a milestone event or be able to step away from my phone for hours and not worry that they might need me and I would be unreachable. Sometimes the needs are urgent \u2014 I need a photo of my vaccination card or please add money to my debit card. Sometimes the needs feel pressing to the kids: a dilemma, an argument with a friend, an uncomfortable experience at work and I try to be just as available for the occasions that are actually urgent and those that just feel urgent.\nThe irony of this is that I am notorious amongst the kids for having missed several urgent phone calls over the years. My failings are always at night when I feel it\u2019s fair to give myself an opportunity to sleep. When the kids were in high school, I didn\u2019t give them curfews; I trusted they would come home at a reasonable hour, and I slept with my bedside lamp and the ringer on until they came home. They knew that when they came back, they would have to wake me up and turn everything off.\nMy daughter almost always arrived back home with a gaggle of friends. By her senior year, I knew she was drinking but I wanted her to be open with me about it so that it could be done responsibly or that if she or her friends needed help they knew they could call me. She was usually tipsy, and I would ask her questions until I could ascertain her level and she would back out of my room saying, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re amusing yourself Mom. Then she and her friends would pile into her canopy bed to sleep and emerge at some point late the next morning when the coffeepot in the kitchen was full.\nMy son was a crapshoot. He either came home just as I had closed my eyes or deep into the night, when I was so sound asleep that his waking me would cause me to gasp, sit straight up, clutch my heart, and say \u201cyou almost gave me a heart attack.\u201d By his senior year, he found it so painful witnessing my fear that we agreed he didn\u2019t have to awaken me anymore, that he could text when he got home and I could check myself when I happened to wake up.\nIf the kids were away from me, on a trip with other families or traveling programs or camp, I felt secure that they were in good hands and I could safely turn the ringer off. One night, my daughter called in the middle of the night from Vietnam. Five times. A boy on her trip had learned that day that his mother had died, on a trip to Paris with her husband, simply not waking up one morning. The twelve kids on the trip were devastated \u2014 for him, by the fear this could happen to any of them, by the realization of how far from home they were. Every other parent answered their phone that night except me. Six years later, I still live with the recriminations and the guilt.\nLast week when we were visiting LA, my son went out with friends and got locked out of our AirB&B. When I awoke in the morning, there were sixteen missed calls from him and a string of texts pleading with me to wake up to open the door. He didn\u2019t want to bang on the door for fear of scaring my mother, who was in the house with us, so he slept outside. I went to retrieve him, saying I\u2019m so sorry over and over again, but he laughed. He understands that I am always there for him, but at night I sleep. What happens then is for him to deal with until I wake up; that\u2019s part of being an independent adult.\nUntil my son left for college last week, I have almost always had at least one kid at home with me. Even if my youngest daughter was with her dad, my son always slept in our apartment. My ex-husband is either with the kids, or he\u2019s completely without the kids, so maybe that has sometimes made him feel like more of a part-time parent or a babysitter. That said, we lived together as a family unit until our eldest daughter was just shy of eighteen, so he had plenty of time to grow into being a full-time father. We all embrace our roles with different levels of involvement and passion. Being a stay-home mom to three kids left little room for me to imagine any other possible role, whereas he worked late hours, frequently traveled, and freely came and went. Probably, as the years passed and he saw my caregiving as my job and his financial support as his job, the roles became muddled for him.\nI\u2019m not accusing him of not being a good dad, it\u2019s just that now when he is the parent with the kids, he is the only parent with the kids, and that means he has to shift his mindset from that of feeling he is covering for me in terms of childcare to stepping fully into his role. He can\u2019t be the babysitter anymore \u2014 he has to be the dad.", "comment_count": 1, "like_count": 134, "created_time": 1631760021673, "comment": [{"user_id": "3b1ac6816075", "comment_time": 1631760021673, "comment": "Thank you for sharing!"}, {"user_id": "a76a07d5fec3", "comment_time": 1646105284864, "comment": "I hated it when my parents would always ask if my husband was babysitting.

Well, not my friend exactly, more like the man I\u2019ve been dating for a few years. He calls me his girlfriend and I have gotten used to it, though I remember the first time he introduced me with that title, I looked around me to see who this girlfriend was and why I didn\u2019t know about her.\nWhen I say the word boyfriend, I choke the word out. It sounds foreign on my tongue, like I\u2019m trying to roll my R\u2019s in Spanish or make the guttural sounds in the Hebrew words I say in prayer. It feels like a relic from another time, the time before my last boyfriend became my husband when I was twenty-five, which was twenty-six years ago.\nBoyfriends are for fanciful young ladies who dream of happy ever afters. I am neither fanciful nor young, neither a lady nor a believer in happy ever afters. A boyfriend is for the girl who wants a boy to take care of her, to wrap her in his flannel shirt when he sees she is shivering. Who waits for the precious gift of a bracelet his mother has secretly chosen and wrapped for him to give to her. Who wants to be in possession of a boyfriend who validates her worth and to know she is in someone else\u2019s possession too.\nI want none of these things, though I did once upon a time, wholeheartedly and with single-minded determination. I was a girl who always had a boyfriend, who was brought home to meet parents and sisters, who helped in the kitchen and always cleared the plates from the table. I strutted like a show horse, displaying how polite I was, how efficient and helpful. I was a girl who wanted a husband.\nThe word boyfriend makes me feel infantilized, but also harkens back to a time when a boyfriend was a gateway to a husband. What to call a friend who is a grown man, decades from boyhood, who is not a gateway but the very thing itself? Boyfriend implies a temporary status and temporary status is all I can commit to. So shouldn\u2019t I embrace that?\nAlternative titles: partner, which positively reeks of commitment; lover, which is so retro and chic I would try it on for size if I could say it with a straight face; paramour, which is a term I do often use, but only with the man in question or if I\u2019m saying it with an arched eyebrow; significant other, which sounds like a business arrangement; escort, but it\u2019s not like I\u2019ve hired him; companion, which makes it sound like we do puzzles together and take strolls in the park, parting with a chaste kiss on the cheek \u2014 and while we do like puzzles and walks, we err more on the side of lust than chastity.\nWhich brings me back to my use of the word \u201cfriend.\u201d According to Oxford Languages, a friend is \u201ca person whom one knows and with whom one has a bond of mutual affection, typically exclusive of sexual or family relations.\u201d This seems like a fair enough assessment of our relationship, but since we do have sexual relations and are somewhat involved in each other\u2019s families, I guess we are atypical friends \u2014 though definitely friends, according to this definition.\nMerriam-Webster assigns no value to sex or family. A friend by their definition is simply someone to whom you are attached, with whom you are not hostile, and who is a favored companion. I\u2019m well aware of how this title can be upgraded to \u201cfriends with benefits,\u201d which one might automatically jump to since we are friends and we have sex, but that would be an inaccurate description, as there is nothing casual or occasional about the sex we have.\nRecently, my daughter asked me if I consider myself single. Yes, I answered, maybe too quickly. She continued, \u201cso you don\u2019t call P your boyfriend?\u201d No, I answered, again maybe too quickly.\n\u201cYou do realize how absurd you sound?\u201d she asked. \u201cI mean, you\u2019ve been dating for years, you see each other and talk all the time. You share friends and make plans for future events. How is he not a boyfriend?\u201d\nI thought hard to come up with an answer that would make sense to her at twenty-two, when sexual relationships either mean you\u2019re hooking up or seeing each other or actually dating, each with its own set of rules and regulations. How to explain that however she might define a girlfriend or boyfriend could not possibly be the same title I would use at the age of fifty-one, divorced, with three kids, dating a man fifteen years my senior with his own divorce and grown kids. If only I could call him my post-divorce midlife boyfriend, that would nail it for me. But the simple and sweet innocence of the word boyfriend is not going to cut it.\nSo I will continue to call him my friend, or I will introduce him by his name and let people make whatever connections they want. If he wants to call me his girlfriend because that feels comfortable for him, so be it. The beauty of being where I am now is that I get to pick and choose what works for me; the only people who need to understand who we are to each other is him and me.", "comment_count": 4, "like_count": 43, "created_time": 1627073143211, "comment": [{"user_id": "3b1ac6816075", "comment_time": 1627073143211, "comment": "Thank you for sharing!"}, {"user_id": "bb8506178688", "comment_time": 1651599851271, "comment": "I\u2019m right there with you!

Is it that finding oneself in midlife causes the crisis or do a series of crises make us acknowledge our midlife status? What I find most shocking about being past the fifty threshold is not my age or how much of my life is behind me, but how much happens by and in midlife that causes serious re-examination of who we are and forces us to ask: what\u2019s the point of all this anyway?\nThis morning, I awaken to a text from an old friend, telling me that she and her husband have separated. Together for 27 years, she writes, just like you. She and I met fifteen years ago, when we used to sit by the community pool while the kids splashed around. I remember the first time I saw her, straight hair down to her waist, a smattering of tattoos on her arms, a tiny bikini at a pool of moms in one-pieces and cover-ups. We were young and busy: serving grapes and Goldfish, breaking up fights, running for cover when the skies opened up.\nAn hour later, I run into a friend on the street. I ask how she is and she pauses, then says ok but with a question mark. I furrow my brows, she takes a deep breath: her husband has brain cancer and is in a wheelchair. Our kids went to the same elementary school, sang together in choir at our synagogue. We often found our way to each other after services when it was time to drink sweet red wine and eat challah. I am dumbfounded, murmuring I\u2019m sorry over and over again until she walks away.\nLater that afternoon, a close friend comes by to see my new apartment. I ask about her kids and she pauses, then says she hadn\u2019t want to share bad news as we celebrate my new home. Her son\u2019s roommate\u2019s father has killed himself, one month before the boys\u2019 graduation from college. What should be a celebratory time has become a time of tragedy. I know that my friend is devastated for the friend and his family but also for her own son, for the experience she wanted for him that he will not get.\nIn recent months, I have attended three funerals for my friends\u2019 parents. I received a phone call from a funeral home to let me know that my father\u2019s ashes were ready for pick up. I signed divorce papers. I\u2019ve awoken night after night drenched from peri-menopausal night sweats, hurling off wet clothes and scooting over for a dry spot in the king-sized bed in which I have slept alone ever since the revelation of my husband\u2019s affair four years ago.\nMy older daughter will graduate from college in a month, my son will complete his first year of college three thousand miles away, my daughter \u2014 the family baby \u2014 has become a teenager seemingly overnight. Last week, she got braces; the next day she asked if she could shave her legs, and the day after that she told me she wanted to walk home from school by herself. The whole reason I had her so much later than the other kids was to prolong the period in which I had kids at home, and now even she\u2019s decided to grow up?\nIs this what midlife is, not a single crisis in which you awaken one morning and realize life is in the express lane when you had thought you were going local, but a series of crises that batter you, signaling that change is here and is not leaving? The only certainty you can count on is that there will be more bad news tomorrow: sickness, death, divorce.\nI can recall a time not so long ago when hearing that a friend my age was seriously ill was rare and shocking. It\u2019s still shocking, but definitely not rare. A friend diagnosed with incurable lung cancer; a friend\u2019s husband with a slow-growing tumor in his thyroid that cannot be removed. The divorces too. First, it was just me and I felt isolated and ashamed. Now it is me who does the soothing, passing along the names of my divorce lawyer and couples therapist.\nI understand now this notion of \u201cthe sandwich generation,\u201d so named by two social workers in 1981 to describe midlifers who are caught between caring for their kids and aging parents at the same time \u2014 and let\u2019s face it, most of these midlife caregivers are women. My own sandwich was brought home to me recently when I made arrangements for my eleven year-old to stay with her dad while I flew out of town to retrieve my eighty year-old mom who had fallen and fractured her knee while visiting my brother.\nI keep thinking about this sandwich metaphor. Am I the turkey slapped between two slices of gluten-free bread, or am I the whole enchilada? What happens when I have an empty nest but am still caring for my mother; am I then an open-faced sandwich? Or if my daughter is still at home with me and God forbid my mother passes; am I the sandwich filling then, or simply an orphan?\nA sandwich is too neat for the precarious state I\u2019m in. This is more like the taco generation: take one bite and the whole thing falls apart. Or the ice cream sandwich generation: starts out nice and neat, but by halftime it\u2019s melting. Or the pizza generation: go for it with zest and burn the roof of your mouth, ruining the rest of the eating experience; wait too long and be stuck with congealed cheese, forever wishing that you hadn\u2019t been so afraid to enjoy the pizza while it was still hot.\nI wouldn\u2019t want to be a teenager again, especially not in the age of social media; nor would I want to be a brand new mother again, walking around like an unkempt zombie leaking fluids while confounded by a fragile object lighter than the weights I now lift to help me stave off osteoporosis. My forties started off with great potential, but by forty-seven I was separated, at forty-nine I found out my birth father was someone other than who I had believed him to be, and just shy of my fiftieth birthday, I was told by my soon-to-be-ex-husband that I had to move from our family home.\nI don\u2019t long to go back, nor is my focus solely on moving forward. I want to be here, now, to simply be in this moment, grateful that I am alive and well as long as that may last. The knowledge that this can all be turned upside down without so much as a polite warning \u2014 the taco splitting at the seams, the ice cream sandwich growing damp and sticky in my hands, the pizza tempting and then burning, cooling and then disappointing \u2014 has changed everything.\nWhen I was younger, normal uneventful days blended together in a haze of school meetings and trips to the grocery store between school drop-off and pick-up and the baby\u2019s nap; I was on the move, all the time, and a bad day was one in which the baby didn\u2019t nap and was scarily cranky. Now a good day is one in which not much happens; a bad day means there has been bad news. A day like today \u2014 three separate parcels of heartbreaking updates on the lives of my friends \u2014 is sadly not uncommon.\nI had always thought a midlife crisis was the moment in which your forty or fiftysomething self rebelled against what was perceived by society as closer to old than young: quick, get a young lover, a sports car, a tattoo. When I told my friends of my husband\u2019s affair, they all believed it to be just this sort of midlife crisis. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s not \u2014 he does, after all, date a woman twenty years his junior and often wears all white clothing, as if he is following a voice telling him to run to the light where perhaps the fountain of youth is.\nI have never wholly believed this though. Isn\u2019t a crisis when something happens to you, like your spouse leaves you, you get a life-altering diagnosis or lose a loved one or a home or a job? If you are the one actively making a decision to change your life, is that a crisis or simply a transition? My husband was not having a crisis. He realized the life he had was no longer the one he wanted. He caused a crisis by deciding this and then acting on it, but it wasn\u2019t what propelled him. He was driven by a desire for a different way to live, the same way people change jobs or move.\nThe blessing and the curse of midlife is that we feel emboldened to live our lives on our own terms. We\u2019ve spent decades building homes and families; the minute we surface from the noise and demands of construction, we may realize what we built no longer suits us. We see, increasingly, that life can turn on a dime and not because of anything we caused or could have stopped. Too much bad news can bury us, or it can wake us up to the realization that we can make changes that may make us happier. The change itself is not the crisis, it is the beginning of the resolution \u2014 for the time being, anyway.\nWhen I was in my twenties, already married and with my first baby, I felt certain I had exactly what I wanted. I had single friends who despaired they would never get the partner or the kids, but I don\u2019t recall regarding them as being in a state of crisis. They saw swirls of change around them and they wanted it for themselves too.\nThis is how I see midlife now and why I reject the concept of the midlife crisis. In our fifties, we are more than twenty years older than those hopeful and often dejected twentysomething selves; we see change around us that looks intriguing and we want in, just like we wanted way back when. Personally, as a true creature of habit, I had not wanted any change at all, but change was forced on me and I decided to embrace it.\nSo what\u2019s the point? Turns out it\u2019s been the same all along: to grow, to build, to love, to accept change with grace and curiosity.", "comment_count": 10, "like_count": 677, "created_time": 1649856887894, "comment": [{"user_id": "3b1ac6816075", "comment_time": 1649856887894, "comment": "Thank you for sharing!"}, {"user_id": "908fdc3bd649", "comment_time": 1650706786572, "comment": "This is gold, thank you for writing it, reading my scrambled mind and making sense of it all!

I remind myself of all that I know of myself, qualities that make me who I am and are unlikely to change even with divorce or moves or career changes. Here is a list of them, in no particular order:\nI don\u2019t sleep well and have terribly vivid nightmares that often leave me scared to go back to sleep \u2014 oh, and perimenopausal night sweats have been drenching me for years.\nI either eat a balanced and healthy diet or nothing but bread and fruit all day. When dinner is over, all hell breaks loose, often in the form of ice cream or Halloween candy I don\u2019t even like anymore but for which I am wildly nostalgic.\nI have at least one glass of wine every night but never drink to excess and if it\u2019s going to be a cocktail, I only have eyes for tequila.\nI am a reader, with two books going at the same time: literary fiction and nonfiction, mostly memoirs, which I listen to on audio. I might be a little bit of a snob about what I read.\nI am a writer. Three years ago in the throes of my wild dating life post-marriage, I decided to write a book; by the skin of my teeth and with the help of a literary agent, a major publisher released it in England last summer and it\u2019s coming out here next month. Still gobsmacked.\nI rarely stick with a television series through to the end, or watch season two even when it\u2019s a show I love, mostly due to an irrational fear of the remote control.\nI feel a kind of joy and pride in my kids that is unmatched by anything else in my life. I marvel at the ways in which they are so different from me and each other; if you ask me which is my favorite (as all three constantly do), I don\u2019t have one (and not just because I fear their wrath should I ever give a name).\nI love to cook and try new recipes, often shopping at international supermarkets for exotic ingredients.\nI knit. I made a matching pair of Fair Isle sweaters for my friend\u2019s baby twins, finished one and came so close to finishing the other that the entirety of it is still hanging from the knitting needles eleven years later.\nI love word games and go for blood when playing against my siblings. I almost always win Big Boggle and I dare them to say otherwise. That said, I also go for blood when playing Candy Land with toddlers so I guess I\u2019m competitive?\nI am a thrift shopper. If you admire my sweater, expect me to say, \u201cit\u2019s cashmere and was $5.99 at The Salvation Army!\u201d\nI love the color pink, on my walls and clothes and dishes and furniture. Passed this along to my two daughters and it may be my greatest achievement as a mother.\nI only wanted daughters, but I ended up with a son sandwiched in between. I made it my mission that he never enter a barbershop for a short haircut or wear sweatpants (until he was old enough to decide that\u2019s all he would wear). He is such an incredible person that I wish I had more sons (but not more children, and I don\u2019t wish my daughters were sons, so this is just to say: I love having a son and that surprises me).\nI find yoga to be insufferably boring. I want to like it, everyone assumes it\u2019s my thing (I have a slight yoga personality), but I\u2019ve tried every variety and you will not be the person who convinces me. I spin and I do Pilates, period.\nThere is almost nothing that brings me joy like a manicure, but also nothing that causes me as much anxiety. The first chip and I am in utter despair. I find gel manicures especially distressing because of the false promise of \u201ctwo-three weeks chip-free!\u201d that fools me every damn time.\nI am deeply offended by every hair that grows on my face and body where it shouldn\u2019t be. My older daughter claims I was extremely heavy-handed in her youth in my advice about where and when to wax, tweeze, shave, and laser. I have told my children: if you are really intent on being my favorite, be the one who shows up at my nursing home with tweezers.\nIf food goes into my freezer, it will stay there for years until one day, I will extract it and try to feed it to you and you will act like I intentionally tried to poison you; if it can\u2019t stay good in there forever, I\u2019m sorry but what\u2019s the point?\nI am a staunch Democrat who has been accused of being a Socialist, especially in my fervid stance on public schools, but I love reading the right-wing New York Post. My mother once threatened not to come over again until I stopped subscribing and I said, \u201cI will miss you.\u201d\nI am a fourth-generation New Yorker and can\u2019t imagine living anywhere else. Yes, it\u2019s dirty, difficult, expensive, and unrelenting but there is nowhere else a friend can text me at noon to say she has tickets for Hamilton that night and do I want them? Or that I can walk into the park in my neighborhood to see a woman dance \u2014 every single day \u2014 on a piece of fabric with ink on her feet. I\u2019m staying; if you try to convince me life would be better elsewhere, you\u2019re wasting your time.\nI\u2019m Jewish-ish. I go to temple more than most of my friends who claim to be more Jewish, and if it\u2019s because one or other of my kids has been singing in the children\u2019s choir for the past fourteen years and I want to see them perform, who are you to tell me it doesn\u2019t count because I don\u2019t know all the prayers in Hebrew or didn\u2019t get bat mitzvah\u2019ed or in actuality am half-Jewish and half-not?\nI am so polite that even when my water broke in temple in a pew that has since been replaced by individual chairs (not because of me, I don\u2019t think), I stood up, walked to the back of the sanctuary and stood in my soaking wet skirt until the service was over to hightail it to the hospital.\nI have had three fathers. It\u2019s complicated: kind of funny, also painful and very confusing.\nMy mother didn\u2019t give me a middle name when I was born because she hated her own, so when I was in third grade I gave myself one: Beth. I then instructed everyone to call me Laura Beth from that point forward, until the mature fourth grader in me bristled, which didn\u2019t stop my father for the next thirty years.\nI am an excellent speller and made my way to the county championship in fifth grade, where I lost over the word septennial, mistaking it for centennial. My mother is still angry at the committee for giving me \u201csuch a stupid word.\u201d My parents enjoyed my spelling acumen so much that they constantly tested me. One time I spelled the word enzyme as \u201cenzime\u201d and my father proceeded to tease me for decades, even calling me by the nickname Enzyme until I finally told him I thought it was weird he was still making fun of me for a word I misspelled when I was ten.\nI had pretty bad acne as a teenager but never had braces and have never had a cavity; as a party trick I will open my mouth wide to let you see my unblemished teeth. Turns out my third father is a dentist, which has nothing to do with the health of my teeth but still, a funny coincidence, no?\nI loathe overused ways of expressing love and birthday wishes: I love you to the moon and back; and just like that, she\u2019s 18; you are my sun, my moon and my stars; here\u2019s to another trip around the sun. If you really love me, find a new way to say it, or just say I love you, simple and true.\nI am in a committed but non-monogamous relationship. I wouldn\u2019t call it open; I\u2019m not into key parties or swinging. I like to know that should a one-night stand become an opportunity in which I want to partake, I can act on it without dishonesty or guilt. I was with my husband for 27 years and now I\u2019m single, and I intend to define that however I want.\nI only had sex with two men before meeting and marrying my husband, so I made up for lost time in the year after our separation when I was 47. I eventually wore myself out and also got attached to a really nice guy, but those sexual adventures are catalogued in my book.\nI was a stay-home mom for twenty years and loved it\u2026running PTAs, manning the cash register at book fairs, lying next to doughy three-year olds when they went down for naps, making friends with the other moms who patiently sat in sandboxes, scooping up sand and trying to toss anything that looked like rat droppings.\nI am now divorced and 51 and need a career ASAP. Husbands love their wives to stay home and keep the machine running smoothly; ex-husbands love ex-wives to earn their keep.\nI am always cold. I grew up in a drafty house where heat was sparingly doled out by my parents, who shouted at me to put on another sweater even when I was so bundled in wool that I could barely lift my arm to do homework. Eventually my mother remedied this by closing the kitchen doors and turning on all the gas burners, and somehow we are all still alive to tell the tale.\nI grew up with pets, but my kids only had a pet that one time I let them keep a Madagascar hissing cockroach their homeschooled babysitter brought over until I saw what I believed to be a sac of eggs in the tank and panicked and wrapped the cage in ten plastic bags and threw it away, traumatizing my kids when they woke up and asked where Lucky was.\nI have a serious mouse phobia and it\u2019s worse than yours. I regularly have nightmares about mice and if I see a bit of black debris on the ground I will pick it up and examine it to verify it\u2019s not a dropping. Once, a mouse drowned in a bottle of olive oil in my country house, which I discovered when I held the dark green bottle up to the light. I announced, \u201cthis house is dead to me\u201d and shortly thereafter, we moved out.\nIt was only after I had all three of my kids that I realized I could and should wear a bikini and I\u2019ve never gone back.\nI am a list-maker. My favorite is one that\u2019s been ongoing for over twenty years with my friend Jessica, called The Depressing List. It\u2019s full of things that we find depressingly funny or, sometimes, just depressing. Another favorite is The Sorry List.\nI love to travel but I hate planning trips and packing gives me actual nightmares. My favorite trip ever was to Peru, the last one my family took together before falling apart.\nI am just as likely to buy myself earrings from Claire\u2019s as I am from a vintage market. I have a little jar filled with my Tiffany wedding bands (my ex liked fancy), of which there are admittedly quite a few because I kept having allergic reactions (prescient, I know). It pains me to look at them, but I can\u2019t bear to sell them or make them into something new.\nI will never walk by a flower stand and not pause. The smell of hyacinths reminds me of setting the table for Passover as a child, and the sight of hydrangeas fills me with longing for the tiny bush I planted at our first country house that grew into an impressive display of purple and pink blossoms. I would have stayed in that house in devotion to my hydrangeas, but then that mouse drowned in the olive oil and well, you know the rest.\nI am like an idiot savant with people\u2019s names. If you tell me your sister\u2019s friend\u2019s daughter\u2019s best friend\u2019s name, I will probably be able to recall it ten years from now.\nI always believed myself to be a terrible artist, but my daughter and I drew so many holiday-themed pictures for our door that I discovered I wasn\u2019t so bad after all. Every morning I draw elaborate notes to tuck into my daughter\u2019s lunch box, and I\u2019m almost always absurdly impressed with the results.\nI loathe museums. When my ex and I were married, I had so many meltdowns in museums that we agreed I would spend one hour with him, and then find a bench and read my book. When friends suggest art exhibits to me or even talk about art, I feel like I\u2019m going to crawl out of my skin. I have passed this along to my children, so our travel plans never include museums; once we bent that rule for the Peggy Guggenheim Museum in Venice, and let\u2019s just say it was a powerful reminder for us all.\nI love watching musicals and listening to musical soundtracks. My son went to a performing arts high school and we have seen so many musicals together that he made me a musical playlist and it\u2019s what I listen to when I need to calm down.\nIf you offer me a chocolate ganache cake from a patisserie or a box of Entenmann\u2019s Devil\u2019s Food Cake, I will always take the Entenmann\u2019s. Or a Yodel, Ring Ding, Devil Dog, or Twinkie. Same with your fancy ice cream. I\u2019ll take Breyer\u2019s.\nI am skeptical of people who use unscented laundry detergent. What is the point of doing laundry if not to inhale each warm item as it emerges from the dryer with the lingering scent of Tide?\nI wear my weekly contact lenses for, I don\u2019t know, maybe months? I do not remember to change them until I can\u2019t see how many fingers I\u2019m holding up in front of my face and realize it\u2019s maybe been a while.\nI am amongst the top 30% of savers at CVS and I\u2019m really proud of it.\nI am a huge fan of karaoke. I have a terrible voice and am not afraid to use it.\nI am religious about not eating mayonnaise and it\u2019s not allowed in my house. If you lie to me that something doesn\u2019t have mayo and it does, I will not forgive you (this includes my mother, who for years put it in her famous whitefish salad promising me it was yogurt).\nI love folding laundry, washing dishes, cleaning floors, have a dustbusting obsession, and holding a Magic Eraser makes me feel like the world is a safe place, but please don\u2019t make me unload the dishwasher.\nI enjoy doing TikTok dances with my daughters but find them shockingly difficult. Forget that my daughter just got into top notch graduate programs and has an almost perfect GPA, it\u2019s her ability to master TikTok dance moves so gracefully that really gets me.\nI have an unhealthy fear of technology. My mom is an award-winning computer scientist in the field of Medical Informatics (don\u2019t ask me what that is); when I went to college I refused to use a computer so she bought me a word processor that became a typewriter with the switch of a button and made me swear never to tell any of her colleagues.\nMy second father was in the Peace Corps in Iran in the 1960s and was thereafter obsessed with Iran \u2014 he spoke fluent Farsi, celebrated the Persian New Year, and watched, read, and ate anything that originated in or featured Iran. Two years ago, I got one of the shocks of my lifetime when I discovered that my birth father was actually Iranian (not just pretending to be one).\nI do not like to swim and actually, I don\u2019t like to be wet. I shower every day but it\u2019s hard for me to get excited about it the way I see other people get.\nI have long curly hair that I rarely wear straight because I want to set a good example for my curly-haired daughters. I keep it as long as possible because my mother had her hairdresser chop my hair off when I was eight saying \u201cI don\u2019t know how to take care of this mop\u201d and I am still upset about it.\nI always have a lot to say and I speak more quickly than most people can follow.

It was January, but the men wore summer colors and jade necklaces. Some had medals but most were dressed as if they were Rotary Club members rather than the Navajo Code Talkers.\nThe year was 1993, a decade before Americans began thanking everyone in uniform \u201cfor your service.\u201d And here were heroes who had come home anonymous, unnoticed, who had to be coaxed into an interview. And here I was, holding a notebook, camera, and fears of saying something wrong and silencing the talkers now so reluctant to talk.\nThey gave names. Albert Smith. Keith Little. James Nakhai. George Kirk. Then we sat and began our journey back fifty years.\n\nI had read of their exploits. How they transcended the bitterness of the forced relocation the Navajo call the Long Walk, and enlisted. How they turned Navajo into a code, naming airplanes for birds, ships for fish. How, as one officer recalled, \u201cwithout the Navajos the Marines would never have taken Iwo Jima.\u201d What I did not know was how Navajo tradition discourages talk of military glory. I learned that on the job.\nThe Navajo code, never broken, was only declassified in 1968, when Vietnam left America in no mood to celebrate soldiers. President Reagan honored the Code Talkers but a decade later, they were scarcely household words. When I pitched their story to Smithsonian, no one at the magazine had heard of them.\n\u201cWhere did you learn about these guys?\u201d an editor asked me.\n\u201cWell,\u201d I said, \u201cI was in a Burger King in Chinle, Arizona. . .\u201d Heading for Colorado, we had stopped in Chinle, in the Navajo Nation. Burger King displayed a local newspaper article. End of story. Get to work.\n\nReaching across cultures and borders, I began searching for Code Talkers to talk in person. E-mail was rare back then, so I wrote to the Navajo Code Talkers Association in Gallup, New Mexico. And waited. And waited. Six weeks later, I began calling, leaving messages, calling again. When I had almost given up, a grizzled voice was on the line.\nAlbert Smith was president of the Code Talkers Association. Well, I don\u2019t know. . . The men didn\u2019t like to brag. . . Well, I don\u2019t know. But maybe if I could get out there in January, he could round up a few.\nTwo weeks later, I was driving on I-40 out of Flagstaff, eastbound. Skirting the Painted Desert, glazed with snow in January, I crossed the New Mexico line and found the address. Led in by a secretary, I met the men. We spoke about my trip. Easy drive. Thanks so much for \u2014\nKeith Little, a hulking man with a soft voice, interrupted. He wanted me to know why it had been so hard to get anyone to talk. Returning from combat, he said, all Navajo had gone through a ceremony called the \u201cEnemy Way,\u201d designed to heal embattled spirits. To speak again was to relive the horrors and to defy a warrior\u2019s tradition of silence. A few men, however, couldn\u2019t resist \u201cspouting off.\u201d Whenever anything appeared in the press, it caused dissention.\nI said I hoped my article wouldn\u2019t cause dissention\n\u201cIt will,\u201d Little said bluntly. But we pressed on. And then, as if borders had opened, they began to talk. Little spoke of a boarding school in Ganado, Arizona, December 7, 1941. . .\n\n\u201cMe and a bunch of guys were out hunting rabbits with a .22. We had a rabbit cooking down in the wash, and somebody went to the dorm, came back and said, \u2018Hey, Pearl Harbor was bombed!\u2019\u201d\nAfter one boy explained where Pearl Harbor was, another asked, \u201cWho did it?\u201d\n\u201cJapan.\u201d\n\u201cWhy\u2019d they do it?\u201d\n\u201cThey hate Americans.\u201d\n\u201cUs, too?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, us too.\u201d\n\u201cThen and there,\u201d Little told me, \u201cwe all made a promise. We promised each other we\u2019d go after the Japanese instead of hunting rabbits.\u201d\n\nOn the stories went. Of why they fought for a nation that had all but erased their nation. \u201cWhat happened to the Navajo were social conflicts,\u201d Albert Smith said. \u201cBut this conflict involved Mother Earth being dominated by foreign countries. It was our responsibility to defend her.\u201d\nThey spoke of seeing bodies wash ashore \u2014 on Guadalcanal, Saipan, Guam, Iwo. James Nakhai told me of a Code Talker captured and tortured by the Japanese. George Kirk showed me a photo of himself, baby-faced, holding a helmet with a hole clean through. \u201cShrapnel,\u201d he said. He didn\u2019t say more.\nThey sat for a picture, old men refusing to fade away as Douglas MacArthur said of old soldiers. I said I\u2019d send them the article, but they didn\u2019t seem to care. They wished me a safe trip home.\nA light snow fell as I bid goodbye. The men melted into the New Mexico desert and I headed to Window Rock, capital of the Navajo Nation. At an elementary school students told me about the Code Talkers.\n\u201cAre they heroes?\u201d teacher Isidore Begay asked his fourth-graders.\nHeads nodded. \u201cWe could have lost the war. Then we\u2019d be slaves to Japan.\u201d\n\nMy article came out that August. I sent copies to the Navajo Code Talkers Association, but I never heard a word. In the decade that followed, the Code Talkers were portrayed in a Hollywood movie, their story told on PBS and the History Channel. Each Code Talker\u2019s death made news. They were honored by presidents, the Pentagon, and in a dozen books.\nThe last original Code Talker died in 2014, but ceremonies continue. Whenever I see more celebration, I remember something Keith Little told me. \u201cMost of us are common men. We don\u2019t get in the front line and wave our arms. We know what we did and can tell it as it was without having to wave it on a TV screen.\u201d\nFROM \u201cTHE ATTIC\u201d \u2014 TRUE STORIES FOR A KINDER, COOLER AMERICA", "comment_count": 1, "like_count": 55, "created_time": 1527353900192, "comment": [{"user_id": "13a56032068c", "comment_time": 1527353900192, "comment": "Thank you for sharing!"}, {"user_id": "e7026133bb87", "comment_time": 1556565503460, "comment": "The necklaces are turquoise, not jade.

Bearded. Long haired. Burning draft cards. Then one afternoon at her son\u2019s first birthday party, Barbara Avedon began to worry.\n\nLook at her little son and his friends. Were they destined to shoulder a gun? Was there no end to war? Over balloons and birthday cake, Avedon, a TV sitcom writer, shared her concerns with other mothers. All agreed. They had to do. . . something.\n\n\n\u201cWe were not \u2018bearded, sandaled youths,\u2019 \u2018wild-eyed radicals,\u2019 or dyed in the wool \u2018old line freedom fighters\u2019,\u201d Avedon remembered. \u201cAnd we wanted Congress to know that they were dealing with an awakening and enraged middle class.\u201d\n\nMother\u2019s Day was approaching. Why not send cards to Congress? The mothers found a graphic artist who sketched a childlike daisy as a logo. Inside the cards mothers wrote:\nFor my Mother\u2019s Day gift this year,\n I don\u2019t want candy or flowers.\n I want an end to killing.\nWe who have given life\n must be dedicated to preserving it.\nPlease talk peace.\nA thousand cards sold out. More were printed, and more. On Mother\u2019s Day, 200,000 cards inundated Congress. At Christmas, 300,000 more cards went out. Another Mother for Peace was born.\n\nAmerica has been called \u201ca country made by war.\u201d Pentagon budgets and military families present a proud, strident face to the world. The eagle on our Great Seal holds arrows in one claw, but in the other claw the eagle clasps an olive branch. And peace has a long legion of American die-hards.\n\nOur Peacemakers range from children drawing doves to grannies on the march. From \u201cradical priests\u201d pouring blood on draft records to grizzled veterans tossing their medals back. From the comfortable signing petitions to the embattled sitting on railroad tracks to block arms shipments. America\u2019s Peacemakers have been mocked and spat on, denounced as traitors, arrested, tortured, killed. But few have been stopped.\n\nThe most prominent have earned peace\u2019s highest honor, the Nobel Prize. Twenty Americans have been peace laureates. The list includes four presidents (Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Jimmy Carter, Barack Obama) and seven diplomats. But nine American peace laureates were ordinary citizens who, defying the drone of guns and drums, took action on their own. And shook things up a bit.\n\nIndividual dedication is inspiring, but war remains a daunting target. War\u2019s relentless march explains why the history of American peacemakers is tied mostly to peace groups. These date to the War of 1812, a short war but a bloody one. In its wake, the New York Peace Society and the Massachusetts Peace Society began speaking out, writing, pamphleting. The two soon merged into the American Peace Society and, other than backing the Civil War, the group has promoted peace ever since.\n\nThroughout the 1800s, peacework remained on the fringes, but come history\u2019s bloodiest century, peace groups sprouted like daisies. Such groups ranged from the Catholic Worker Movement and the Women\u2019s International League for Peace and Freedom to the American Friends Service Committee and the War Resister\u2019s League\nWorld War II, the \u201cgood war,\u201d silenced most pacifists but peace groups emerged in full stride to oppose the nuclear arms race and Vietnam.\n\nSurging during the Eighties when a million Americans gathered one day in Central Park to support a Nuclear Freeze, groups have since splintered, only coalescing during another war, another \u201cmilitary action.\u201d Yet for all their marching, pamphleting, protesting, peace remains elusive and we spend billions each day to prepare for war. Still, the Peacemakers hold onto hope.\n\nTo some, peace seems a universal good, yet the appeal of war goes well beyond guns and drums. Another American pacifist, philosopher William James, understood why. \u201cThe war against war is going to be no holiday excursion or camping party,\u201d James declared at the dedication of a Civil War memorial. The horrors of war \u201cmake the fascination. War is the strong life; it is life in extremis.. . . The popular imagination fairly fattens on the thought of wars. Let public opinion once reach a certain fighting pitch, and no ruler can withstand it.\u201d\n\nGiven the heroism and honor in fighting for your country, it takes a special person to work for peace. Peacemakers are free not just of the martial spirit but free from fear of standing alone, standing on principle no matter what the cost. War after war, such people emerge, olive branches in hand.\n\nSince 2000, America\u2019s peace groups have multiplied and diversified. Today, among more than 100 such groups are CODE PINK: Women for Peace, the Granny Peace Brigade, the Peace Crane Project, the Campus Anti-War Network, and Another Mother For Peace, revived in 2003 by Joshua Avedon, whose birthday party jumpstarted the group in 1967.\n\nThe Peacemakers, William James noted, are easy to dismiss. Sentimental softies promoting \u201ca world of clerks and teachers.\u201d How dare they deny a nation\u2019s legitimate defense? Will \u201cGive Peace a Chance\u201d protect us against the Hitlers, the Stalins, the Putins. Sure, we\u2019re all against war but sometimes. . .\n\nThe Peacemakers know these arguments all too well. Their answers are complex, nuanced, but can be summed up in a single word \u2014 enough. Enough of the killing, the slaughter. Enough of the billions spent to prepare for war. Enough of raising children to be soldiers.\nThe peacemakers are not blessed to all, but in defiance of history and hubris, they march on. This month, we\u2019ll meet some of the blessed.\n", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 0, "created_time": 1651515705432, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["Peace", "Pacifism", "Anti War Movement", "Peacebuilding", "Activism"]}, {"author": "The Attic", "post_id": "1f05037462a9", "user_id": "13a56032068c", "title": "THE NEWS IN WHITE AND BLACK", "content": "THE NEWS IN WHITE AND BLACK\nFrom The Attic \u2014 for a Kinder, Cooler America\nCHICAGO, FEBRUARY 1916 \u2014 On a frigid and windblown day, a small item appeared in a Chicago newspaper. Several hundred black families had quietly left Selma, Alabama, heading north. Their treatment in the South, one refugee told the paper, \u201cdoesn\u2019t warrant staying.\u201d\n\nThe 1910s marked the peak of American newspapers. More than a thousand nationwide, several in each major city, printed news in black and white. Yet no other newspaper tracked this all-black story, just the Chicago Defender.\n\nBlack newspapers had come and gone, none attracting more than a thousand readers. But the Defender, born in the darkest days of Jim Crow, became a voice of freedom, of justice, of hope. The flagship of the black press, the Defender was as proud and determined its founder.\n\nRaised in a mixed-race family, with a German step-father and black mother, Robert Sengstacke Abbott hated the words \u201cNegro\u201d and \u201cblack.\u201d During his 35 years at the helm of the Defender, the newspaper never used either. African-Americans were simply \u201cthe Race.\u201d\n\nAbbott came by his pride the usual way \u2014 through insult. After studying printing at the Hampton Institute, he earned a law degree in Chicago. But practicing law in Gary, Indiana and Topeka, Kansas, he met bigotry face-to-face. Who in the age of Plessy v. Ferguson, of \u201cseparate but equal,\u201d would hire a black lawyer?\nOutraged, Abbott returned to Chicago. Then in 1905, he saw that the growing Chicago neighborhood locals called \u201cBronzeville\u201d needed its own newspaper. Nothing blacks did, other than crime, ever made the conservative Chicago Tribune. Why not a separate but equal paper to cover \u201cthe Race?\u201d\n\nAbbott printed the first edition in the kitchen of his boarding house. He distributed 300 copies door-to-door. He sold ads. He set type. He wrote and wrote. And circulation grew. In 1910, he hired his first editor, a man schooled in the tabloid tactics of the Hearst Press. With full page photo spreads and bold headlines, many printed in red, the Defender claimed its place in Chicago. The Trib called itself \u201cThe World\u2019s Greatest Newspaper.\u201d Not to be outdone, Abbott called the Defender \u201cThe World\u2019s Greatest Weekly.\u201d\n\nCirculation rose, by 1916, to 50,000. That year, the migration began, thousands, then tens of thousands of African-Americans began fleeing the South, seeking \u201cthe warmth of other suns.\u201d The Defender would be their cheerleader and guiding light.\n\nOn May 15, 1917, Abbott proclaimed a \u201cGreat Migration Day.\u201d Calling for an epic \u201cFlight out of Egypt,\u201d the Defender offered a discount \u2014 three bucks for a train ticket to Chicago. When some 2,000 blacks a day began arriving, The Trib headlined \u201cHALF A MILLION DARKIES FROM DIXIE SWARM TO THE NORTH. . .\u201d But the Defender met the arrivals at the train station with banners reading \u201cSAVED FROM THE SOUTH.\u201d\n\nOnce blacks began streaming into Detroit, New York, Philadelphia, smaller black newspapers flourished. The Pittsburgh Courier. The St. Louis Argus. Too many in Harlem to name. But the Defender remained the black newspaper of record.\n\nAs circulation approached 200,000, only a third of Defender readers lived in Chicago. Abbott had arranged for black Pullman porters working on southbound trains to spread the paper and its promise. The Defender listed Chicago jobs, housing, train schedules, and touted the open atmosphere of the North. When some Southern states banned the Defender, porters smuggled it, dumping bundles of papers at secret locations where they were picked up and passed out to be read aloud in homes, churches, and barber shops.\n\nAnd more came north. And more.\nAlong with daily news, the Defender had a list of causes, the Defender\u2019s Bible. Demands included anti-lynching laws, the hiring of black bus drivers, railroad engineers, and conductors, full voting rights, and the destruction of all \u201cAmerican race prejudice.\u201d\n\nReaders relished the Defender\u2019s commitment, but they also turned to it for news more black than white. When race riots scarred Chicago in 1919, the Trib denounced \u201ca crowd of howling Negroes\u201d and printed a casualty list that was 3/4 white. The Defender, however, saw the savage truth historians later confirmed: a black teenager\u2019s innocent drift onto a Whites Only beach had unleashed white mobs \u2014 \u201ca certain madness distinctly indicated in reports of shootings, stabbings and burning of buildings. . . \u201d Two-thirds of the casualties, the Defender noted, were black.\n\nAbbott died in 1940, leaving the paper to his nephew. John H. Sengstacke made the Defender a daily in 1955, offering full coverage of the Emmett Till lynching, the rise of Martin Luther King, and marches across the South. Noted writers, including Langston Hughes, Richard Wright, and Gwendolyn Brooks wrote for the Chicago Defender.\n\nAs some of its Bible became law, the Defender lost readers. Black reporters began working for major papers, even the Trib. Circulation dropped as TV news surged. The Defender pressed on into the new century, becoming a weekly again in 2008, then closing its print edition in 2019. But you can still read the flagship of the black press online.\n\nThe Chicago Defender, Langston Hughes wrote, was \u201cthe journalistic voice of a largely voiceless people.\u201d But although Hughes was the great American dream poet, the news offered a nearer dreamworld. \u201cIf all of their dream does not come true,\u201d the Defender wrote of the Great Migration, \u201cenough will come to pass to justify their actions.\u201d\n", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 58, "created_time": 1645039650684, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["African American", "American History", "Black History Month", "Chicago"]}, {"author": "The Attic", "post_id": "e24e850234e4", "user_id": "13a56032068c", "title": "LINCOLN AND THE \u2018MOBOCRATIC SPIRIT\u2019", "content": "LINCOLN AND THE \u2018MOBOCRATIC SPIRIT\u2019\nFrom The Attic \u2014 for a kinder, cooler America\n\nALTON, IL \u2014 1837 \u2014 As darkness falls, as the river flows, hundreds of howling men, torches ablaze, surround a warehouse in this small town along the Mississippi. Inside sits their target \u2014 a printing press.\nThis is not Elijah Lovejoy\u2019s first encounter with a mob. Three times his presses, guilty only of printing attacks on slavery, have been thrown into the Mississippi. Now another mob. . .\n\nSomeone puts a ladder up. A boy climbs to set the warehouse roof on fire. Lovejoy emerges, topples the ladder, retreats. But when the ladder goes up again, he steps into the crossfire. The murder, says John Quincy Adams, \u201dis a shock as of an earthquake to this country.\u201d\nWeeks later, on a wintry Saturday evening, a tall, skinny man rises to speak before the Springfield Lyceum. The Lyceum has one rule for speakers \u2014 no politics. But mobs, regardless of their cause, are not \u201cpolitics by other means.\u201d Mobs, the speaker knows, are the opposite of politics. His topic: \u201cThe Perpetuation of our Political Institutions.\u201d\n\nFew in the audience know him. A recent arrival in Springfield, he is a \u201cprairie lawyer,\u201d riding horseback to try cases throughout central Illinois. Awkward and ungainly, he also has, a friend says, \u201ca gloomy and melancholy face,\u201d a face etched with loss. At 28, he has already buried his mother, infant brother, sister, and first love. His name is Lincoln.\n\n\u201cIn the great journal of things happening under the sun, we, the American People. . . find ourselves in the peaceful possession of the fairest portion of the earth.\u201d We did not earn this blessing, Lincoln continues. Our democracy is an inheritance, and our task is preservation.\n\u201cHow then shall we perform it? At what point shall we expect the approach of danger? By what means shall we fortify against it? Shall we expect some transatlantic military giant to step the ocean and crush us at a blow? Never! All the armies of Europe, Asia, and Africa combined, with all the treasure of the earth in their military chest, with a Bonaparte for a commander, could not by force, take a drink from the Ohio, or make a track on the Blue Ridge in a trial of a thousand years.\u201d\n\nWhat, then, threatens democracy?\n\u201cIf destruction be our lot we must ourselves be its author and finisher.\u201c\nNow the lean lawyer pauses. He hopes he is being \u201cover wary,\u201d yet he sees \u201csomething of ill-omen amongst us.\u201d Mobs are unleashing \u201cwild and furious passions, in lieu of the sober judgment of courts.\u201d He cites examples. A freed slave lynched. An editor gunned down. And from Mississippi, where he rode flatboats along the river, Lincoln recalls the strange fruit he saw, bodies white and black \u201cdangling from the boughs of trees upon every road side; and in numbers almost sufficient to rival the native Spanish moss of the country, as a drapery of the forest.\u201d\n\nSo who cares, he asks. When a crime is committed, who cares if justice comes from a mob or a court? You do, because. . .\n\u201cWhenever the vicious portion of population shall be permitted to gather in bands of hundreds and thousands, and burn churches, ravage and rob provision-stores, throw printing presses into rivers, shoot editors, and hang and burn obnoxious persons at pleasure, and with impunity, depend on it \u2014 this government cannot last.\u201d\n\nLincoln goes on to warn against tyrants. Will America be spared the ambition of a Caesar or Napoleon? An American tyrant will come, Lincoln says, \u201cand when such a one does, it will require the people to be united with each other, attached to the government and laws, and generally intelligent, to successfully frustrate his designs.\u201d Even if such a tyrant begins with good intentions, \u201cthat opportunity being past, and nothing left to be done in the way of building up, he would set boldly to the task of pulling down.\u201d\n\nLincoln\u2019s Lyceum Address did not put him on the road to the White House. Two decades of political and personal loss followed. As North and South careened toward civil war, mobs raged again and again. But perhaps Lincoln wasn\u2019t speaking to the America of his time. Perhaps he was speaking to America for all times.\n\nLast January 7, Illinois\u2019 governor activated the National Guard. Until Inauguration Day, guardsmen protected the capitol a few blocks from where Lincoln spoke. Similar sights \u2014 armed guardsmen outside other state capitols and the nation\u2019s capital \u2014 shook the certainty of democracy. But no government \u201cof the people, by the people\u201d can be held together by guardsmen or police. As Lincoln taught us, the sole guardian of democracy is \u201cthe people\u201d themselves.\n\nBack at the podium, he rises to his finish. Faced with \u201cthe mobocratic spirit. . . the question recurs, \u2018How shall we fortify against it?\u2019 The answer is simple. Let reverence for the laws be breathed by every American mother to the lisping babe that prattles on her lap. Let it be taught in schools, in seminaries, and in colleges; let it be written in primers, spelling books, and in almanacs; let it be preached from the pulpit, proclaimed in legislative halls, and enforced in courts of justice.\u201d Let the law, Lincoln says, \u201cbecome the political religion of the nation.\u201d\nThe river flows on.\n", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 0, "created_time": 1641328296435, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["January 6 2021", "January 6 Insurrection", "Abraham Lincoln", "Mob Violence", "Democracy"]}, {"author": "Tim Wise", "post_id": "485afc77cf47", "user_id": "de76cf9829db", "title": "13 Questions for Those Who Want to Ban \u201cCritical Race Theory\u201d", "content": "13 Questions for Those Who Want to Ban \u201cCritical Race Theory\u201d\nThey won\u2019t answer them though. Because if they did, they would sound ridiculous.\nImage: Luis Molinaro, Shutterstock, standard license, purchased by author\nFor the past year, conservatives have been waging war on what they call \u201ccritical race theory\u201d in schools, but which often amounts to nothing more than an honest accounting of racism in American history.\nFrom attempts at book banning to shutting down teacher trainings on the Civil Rights Movement to complaining about Black History Month, white conservatives are insisting that schools stop making their kids feel bad by talking about racial injustice.\nThe goal, it appears, is to prohibit any analysis of our country\u2019s history that might detract from an entirely uncritical nationalism.\nDozens of states have introduced or passed legislation restricting how racial subjects can be addressed in classrooms. Already, books are being yanked from school libraries to be reviewed by lawmakers and parents\u2019 groups for any \u201cinappropriate\u201d content.\nThese efforts raise several questions. And in the interest of transparency \u2014 the buzzword conservatives use to justify opening curriculum to parental scrutiny \u2014 it seems only fair that they should be expected to respond to them.\nThe legislation proposed or passed thus far prohibits material intended to make students feel \u201cguilt, shame, or discomfort\u201d because of their race. While all agree that no one should seek to make another person feel bad because of their racial identity, how will the intent of such material and the teachers who teach it be determined? If the material presents factual information or an analysis of historical events for consideration, but happens to make students or parents feel bad, should it be disallowed?\nThe legislation also seeks to prohibit materials that suggest America is an \u201cinherently racist\u201d nation. But what does that mean? For instance, enslavement was embedded in the U.S. at its inception, and was rooted in white supremacy. So, would teaching those facts amount to calling the country \u201cinherently racist?\u201d If so, how can we teach about enslavement? If teachers mention that the founders believed citizenship should be limited to whites \u2014 they said as much in the Naturalization Act of 1790 \u2014 would they be guilty of calling the U.S. \u201cinherently racist?\u201d\nSeveral states have proposed giving parents the right to sue teachers and schools that violate the new rules or teach \u201cdivisive subjects.\u201d But since divisiveness is subjective and a parent might overreact (by thinking material is meant to make their child feel guilt, even when it isn\u2019t), might the fear of being sued intimidate teachers and dissuade them from discussing anything about racism in history, or any possibly controversial issue? If so, doesn\u2019t that hamper the cause of learning? And if teachers avoid such topics for fear of white parents suing, wouldn\u2019t that disrespect people of color by ignoring issues that are important to them? If so, could they sue schools for not talking about these subjects? If not, why not?\nIn teaching the Civil War, Southern states have long downplayed the central role of slavery and white supremacy in the decision to secede. Texas only started telling the truth about this matter in 2019. Teaching that white supremacy was the \u201ccornerstone\u201d of the Confederacy (according to their own Vice-President) might cause some white parents to think teachers were trying to make them feel shame because their families fought for the Confederacy. If so, should teachers no longer tell the truth about why those states seceded? Must we teach the pro-Confederate position so as to be \u201cbalanced?\u201d If so, since the Confederacy was created to defend slavery and white supremacy, how could that perspective be taught without making Black students feel discomfort because of their race?\nOne of the groups leading the charge against anti-racist curriculum is Moms for Liberty. On their website, they have recommended the historical work of W. Cleon Skousen. Among other things, Skousen believed white enslavers were \u201cthe worst victims\u201d of the system of enslavement, that enslaved Black folks (whom he called \u201cpickaninnies\u201d) were \u201ccheerful\u201d despite their bondage, and that the Civil Rights Movement \u201cwas being manipulated from Moscow with the goal of creating a \u2018Soviet Negro Republic\u2019 in the Southern United States.\u201d Do you agree? If not, why are you allying with a group that recommends this material, even as it seeks to remove children\u2019s books about Martin Luther King Jr. from classrooms?\nIf material about white privilege or systemic racism can be prohibited because it offends white people, should we ban material celebrating founding fathers who owned human beings or westward expansion, which might make Black or Indigenous persons equally uncomfortable? If not, why the difference? Are you saying that white students can\u2019t be made uncomfortable, but non-white students can be?\nIn teaching about World War Two, should Japanese American parents be able to veto teaching about the attack on Pearl Harbor since it might lead to hostility against their kids because of their familial origins? Should Muslim and Arab American parents be able to veto material about 9/11 for fear it might provoke animosity towards their children or instill guilt for the actions of others of their faith or ethnicity? If not, why the difference? Is veto power only enjoyed by whites and Christians?\nIf systemic racism can\u2019t be discussed as a reason for ongoing racial inequities in the U.S. \u2014 because this might cast aspersions on America as a \u201cracist nation\u201d \u2014 what explanations for inequality will be allowed in classroom discussions?\nIf you answer (as many conservatives would) that teachers could discuss things like \u201cout of wedlock childbirth\u201d or a lack of \u201cpersonal responsibility\u201d as reasons for ongoing disparities in economic well-being, what if these explanations offend Black students or parents because they stigmatize Black people, culture, and communities? Should those theories also be banned? If not, why the difference?\nYou say we should focus less on the history of racism in America and more on the nation\u2019s progress. But how can one appreciate progress without a clear sense of how deeply embedded white supremacy and racism were and how awful things were for non-white persons for most of our history?\nYou quote Martin Luther King Jr. a lot \u2014 at least that one line about judging people by the \u201ccontent of their character\u201d rather than the color of skin. Since you like King so much (ignoring for a second that some folks on your side are trying to ban books about him), have you read any of his writings? If so, name them (no Googling allowed).\nHere are two more things King said. The first is from his last essay, which was published after his assassination, and the second is from a speech to the American Psychological Association in September 1967. Can teachers teach this part of King\u2019s thinking, or would they be limited to the things King said with which you agree? First:\n\u201c\u2026the largest part of white America is still poisoned by racism, which is as native to our soil as pine trees, sagebrush, and buffalo grass.\u201d\nand then:\n\u201cthe philosophy and morals of the dominant white society are not holy or sacred but in all too many respects are degenerate and profane.\u201d\nOh, and here\u2019s a bonus question.\nIn his last book, Where Do We Go From Here? Dr. King wrote the following:\n\u201cIt is an aspect of their sense of superiority that the white people of America believe they have so little to learn.\u201d\nSo, thinking about that statement, this last question is really easy:\n13.

Wade Is Really About", "content": "Here\u2019s What the Reversal of Roe v. Wade Is Really About\nIt\u2019s not state\u2019s rights or even abortion \u2014 it\u2019s the control of women and the imposition of Christian authoritarianism\nJustice Samuel Alito, Image: DonkeyHotey, Flickr, Creative Commons, Attribution 2.0 Generic (CC BY 2.0)\nYou can tell a lot about a person by the company they keep.\nWhether it\u2019s their close friends or the ideological company with which they cavort.\nOr those whom they favorably quote.\nConsider Justice Samuel Alito, who, in his recently leaked draft opinion overturning Roe v. Wade, made it clear whose authority he believes we should rely upon for assessing the legitimacy of abortion.\nThat authority?\nSir Matthew Hale, a 17th-century English Judge.\nIn his decision \u2014 in which he says the Court misinterpreted history when they legalized abortion in 1973 \u2014 Alito references Hale, who insisted that abortion was a \u201cgreat crime.\u201d\nEven though Hale wasn\u2019t an American judge whose meanderings might be seen as a matter of national importance, Alito insists his views are relevant.\nWhy? Because they speak to the common law tradition to which we should be largely bound and from which he believes Roe grievously deviated.\nAnd he says this even though no state outlawed abortion for the first century of the nation\u2019s existence, despite that common law history.\nIn other words, the founders didn\u2019t give a rip about Judge Hale.\nBut according to Alito, Hale is the authority to whom we should look for guidance here.\nWhich tells us a lot about Samuel Alito and the thinking of the anti-abortion right-wing.\nBecause Sir Matthew Hale wasn\u2019t merely a jurist who viewed abortion as a horrible offense.\nHe was also one who imposed death sentences on women for witchcraft and devised the theory that a husband couldn\u2019t be guilty of raping his wife because:\n\u2026the husband cannot be guilty of rape\u2026upon his lawful wife, for by their mutual matrimonial consent and contract the wife hath given herself up to this kind unto her husband which she cannot retract.\nLovely.\nThis is the individual to whom we should listen.\nA man who murdered women under cover of law and justified their rape under the same.\nHe, and not our own notions of right and wrong, should guide us.\nHe, and not women themselves, should be the arbiter of how their pregnancies progress, or if they do.\nThis is what the right has always believed: that the thinking of long-dead men (especially white men and Christians) should take priority over modern notions of justice and equality.\nEspecially when those modern notions might have been influenced by those who would have been previously forced into silence.\nThis was never about \u201cstate\u2019s rights\u201d or even abortion, per se\nAnyone who believes the fight to overturn Roe has been about abortion alone hasn\u2019t been paying attention.\nIt was never that simple.\nNor was it about returning these matters to the states.\nOh sure, some conservatives would insist that was their only purpose.\nThey would say things like, \u201cNine judges in DC shouldn\u2019t tell people in Alabama or Nebraska how to think about the sanctity of human life.\u201d\nIn other words, states should be free to live by their own moral convictions on such matters.\nIf Mississippi wants to outlaw abortion, it should be allowed to. If California wishes to keep it legal, so be it.\nBut they never meant any of that.\nNow that Roe is to be overturned, those who fought to make that happen have revealed their true selves.\nThey now admit their desire to obtain a nationwide ban on abortion if Republicans reclaim control of both houses of Congress.\nWhich shouldn\u2019t be surprising.\nAfter all, if you believe abortion is murder and that embryonic and fetal life is morally equal to the woman carrying it, it stands to reason you wouldn\u2019t be satisfied with banning abortion in 26 states.\nOnce one decides a woman has no right to bodily autonomy and that she can be forced to sacrifice that body to another being against her will, federalism becomes a trifle.\nBut not only that.\nFar more than abortion is at risk.\nBy ruling that the legal basis for Roe was faulty \u2014 that an implicit right to privacy exists in the Constitution \u2014 the Court has thrown down the gauntlet against the last half-century of jurisprudence regarding sex and gender.\nPrivacy was the basis for the Griswold v. Connecticut decision, which struck down state laws against contraception.\nIf there is no right to privacy, there is no right to control one\u2019s reproduction even before becoming pregnant.\nThough no state would outlaw all forms of contraception, it is certainly conceivable that several might seek to ban birth control pills, which some believe (falsely) to be abortifacients.\nBeyond matters of reproduction, Lawrence v. Texas, the decision striking down so-called sodomy laws \u2014 really, the outlawing of homosexuality \u2014 relied upon the principle of privacy now put in the wood chipper by the highest Court.\nAnd since Alito\u2019s opinion insists rights aren\u2019t real if they haven\u2019t stood the test of time over many generations, it seems almost certain that he and his reactionary colleagues would find overturning Lawrence and once again outlawing LGBTQ folks acceptable.\nAs well as marriage equality.\nAlthough Obergefell v. Hodges rested upon more than an implied privacy right \u2014 it also turned on notions of equal protection \u2014 there is little doubt that Alito would apply his anti-Roe logic to that decision.\nIndeed, he already did in his dissent to Obergefell: an opinion for which he didn\u2019t have a majority then \u2014 but likely would now.\nThe real goal is domination and control \u2014 the restoration of traditional hierarchy\nIt is time to face the facts.\nFirst, those who still say \u201cthere\u2019s no real difference between Democrats and Republicans\u201d are unworthy of being listened to about anything beyond restaurant Yelp reviews at this point.\nIf you\u2019re one of those who thought it would be no big deal if Trump won, or if some Republican Senator in your state did \u2014 so you sat out the elections or voted for some third party candidate so you could feel pure \u2014 seriously, fuck you very much.\nSecond, know this: the war on Roe was never about abortion so much as restoring traditional hierarchy and authority.\nOutlawing abortion and limiting, if not banning, certain types of birth control strips women of sexual autonomy and restores hegemonic sexual power to men.\nWhich is precisely the point.\nThey aren\u2019t principally concerned about fetuses and embryos, let alone \u201cbabies.\u201d\nAs Margaret Renkl noted in her recent New York Times piece, if they were, they would support policies that would bring down abortion rates dramatically by reducing the number of unplanned pregnancies.\nThey would want expanded access to birth control and more comprehensive sex education, which actually works, unlike the abstinence version.\nBut they have supported neither of these.\nWhy? Because their desire to limit abortion and save fetal life was always less important to them than restricting sexual activity outside of marriage or sex for pleasure without the possibility of procreation.\nAdditionally, as Renkl notes, if they\u2019d been concerned with reducing abortions, they would have supported expanded social safety nets for families and children \u2014 affordable child care, paid family leave, and more comprehensive health care coverage \u2014 rather than seeking to slash these.\nBut in each case, they took the position that would make it more difficult for parents to raise children, increasing the likelihood that a pregnancy would end in abortion.\nBecause this was never about saving babies.\nIt was about controlling women and maintaining traditional hierarchy, which, in the economic sense, would be challenged by larger safety nets.\nIf that doesn\u2019t convince you, there is one final proof that the right cares only about controlling women and nothing for \u201csaving babies.\u201d\nNamely, the way conservatives address in vitro fertilization.\nJessica Valenti has pointed out that if fertilized eggs are \u201cpersons\u201d in the womb, they must also be persons when waiting to be implanted in a woman who has stored them for later usage.\nBut if so, why do abortion opponents not seek to prohibit the discarding of such \u201cpersons,\u201d which occurs all the time, usually after successful implantation and once a couple (or single woman) decides they don\u2019t want more kids?\nWhy don\u2019t pro-lifers seek to prosecute couples who discard their \u201cextra babies\u201d or the labs who do?\nWhen Alabama State Senator Clyde Chambliss was asked this a few years ago, he gave the revealing answer, noting that \u201cthe egg in the lab doesn\u2019t apply. It\u2019s not in a woman. She\u2019s not pregnant.\u201d\nRight, because abortion restrictions are not about saving human life, they are about restricting the rights and autonomy of women.\nThe right-wing is solely about domination and subordination.\nIt is all they have ever been about.\nThe Republican Party and its ideological leaders are the enemies of women\u2019s liberty.\nThey must be defeated, finally and forever.\nNot compromised with.\nNot understood or brought into some broader bipartisan coalition.\nCrushed.", "comment_count": 9, "like_count": 619, "created_time": 1651585268883, "comment": [{"user_id": "de76cf9829db", "comment_time": 1651585268883, "comment": "Thank you for sharing!"}, {"user_id": "20f8e2a63e8e", "comment_time": 1651687352939, "comment": "Oh what a wicked web we weave, when we practice to deceive!

So was his daddy, who groomed him.\nAnd Pat Robertson is a groomer so committed to his craft that even though he\u2019s roughly 137 years old and looks like he died a decade ago, he\u2019d rather stay on Earth grooming than go and actually meet Jesus.\nThat\u2019s commitment.\nThese guys are definitely groomers (again, in the spiritual sense). Oh, and creepy as hell.\nImage: gredelkhan, Flickr, Creative Commons license, Attribution 2.0 Generic (CC BY 2.0)\nThose folks in that recent viral video who thought it was cool to sing about Jesus to a captive audience on a commercial flight at 30,000 feet?\nGroomers.\nOh, and people who should be on the no-fly list for the next forever years.\nIn case you missed their display of arrogant Christian privilege and entitlement, here it is:\nVideo: Twitter, @davenewworld_2, 4/16/22\nHere\u2019s another guy from a different flight, dispensing with the guitar and cheesy sing-a-long and just getting right to the altar call.

Despite how hateful and grotesque such a God would be, the groomers persist, recruiting more members to their cult of the perpetually-abusive father.\nBecause they think God instructed them to do this \u2014 to evangelize the world as part of the so-called \u201cGreat Commission.\u201d\nOf course, the Bible also instructs them that praying in public and making a spectacle of their faith is what hypocrites do.\nIt\u2019s the signature move of people more interested in performative piety than righteousness.\nAnd so, in the book of Matthew (Chapter 6, verses 5\u20136), believers are told to pray in their closets.\nBut Christian groomers don\u2019t like to be in the closet.\nThey insist on coming out of the closet, despite God\u2019s clearly stated preferences.\nMy middle school principal was a groomer, as were most of the teachers there.\nWhen that principal forced all the students into the auditorium for a mandatory Young Life meeting, he was grooming us and delivering us into the hands of still more groomers who spent a half-hour testifying about the Lord.\nIn a public school.\nThe only reason he didn\u2019t do it again was because, sensing the evangelical stranger danger, I walked out and threatened to sue him.\nI was 12. But even then, I was groomer-proof.\nMy parents had made sure of that. As a Jewish kid in the Nashville public schools of the 1970s and early \u201880s, I had the ACLU number memorized.\nLater, my high school psychology teacher distributed pamphlets in class explaining the Biblical case against abortion. He then insisted it was OK for husbands to force sex on their wives because \u201cthe Bible says the marriage bed is not defiled.\u201d\nAnd so, once again, I was forced to explain the Constitution (and how incredibly easy it is to lose one\u2019s job) to an adult.\nHe stopped with the pamphlets and the \u201cJesus-is-cool-with-wife-rape\u201d stuff.\nAt least for a while.\nBut after I graduated, he was back to his old ways because evangelical groomers have a hard time breaking free from their compulsions.\nAs the basketball and golf coach, he was now trying to force anyone who played a team sport to join the Fellowship of Christian Athletes.\nAgain, this was a public school.\nBut groomers don\u2019t care about the rules.\nThey are unable to resist the lure of new recruits.\nThey are insatiable.\nTheir soul lust is all-consuming.\nSo yet another family had to threaten him. This time, he learned his lesson and how to keep his faith hole zipped up from 7\u20132, Mondays through Fridays.\nAs he should have been forced to do from the start.\nI\u2019m guessing my description here of evangelical Christians will make many readers uncomfortable.\nPerhaps you\u2019re worried that my words besmirch the larger body of Christendom.\nBut nothing could be further from the truth.\nMost Christians are not like this. My wife, a Christian, is not. My mother, a Christian, is not. My best friend, a Christian, is not.\nEven among evangelicals, there are some who are not as I\u2019ve described here.\nJim Wallis, a moral giant of the modern era, is an evangelical, and I revere him. Because the only grooming he\u2019s doing involves recruiting people to live and act as Jesus did.\nHe doesn\u2019t spend his time getting people to profess his particular faith and threatening those who don\u2019t with fire and brimstone. He speaks against injustice and in favor of love.\nHe is evangelical, but an evangelical of deeds, not words \u2014 of brave example, not cowardly ultimatums.\nSadly, we have too few Jim Wallises and too many groomers.\nAnd if what I\u2019ve said here makes you squirm, ask yourself, why?\nIs it because it challenges beliefs that you were groomed to accept?\nIs it because you\u2019re afraid that if you laugh at the funny parts or agree with any portion of it, you might anger God, who will strike you down for your apostasy?\nIs it because you think that if the lake of fire and Jesus-is-the-only-way stuff aren\u2019t true, there is no purpose to human existence?\nIf the answer to any of these is yes, perhaps it\u2019s time to accept the truth: evangelical Christian groomers have abused you, damaged us all, and made our country and the world less pluralistic and accepting.\nAnd if my words make you uncomfortable because, as an evangelical, you find them offensive, well\u2026\n\u2026OK, Groomer.", "comment_count": 30, "like_count": 2155, "created_time": 1650588861829, "comment": [{"user_id": "de76cf9829db", "comment_time": 1650588861829, "comment": "Thank you for sharing!"}, {"user_id": "7236fd6fdf5c", "comment_time": 1651154455976, "comment": "Fabulous and well written article!

But this is a monstrous standard that would turn notions of right and wrong into perpetual moving targets\nAfter all, during the periods in which the lynching of Black people was common, it was \u201cacceptable\u201d to many.\nThat\u2019s why participants in this barbarism and the crowds who gathered to watch the spectacle were never prosecuted.\nBecause it was \u201cOK back then.\u201d\nBut so what?\nIf you would minimize the depravity of racist murder simply because it was once common (thus, socially acceptable in certain quarters), you\u2019re no different than the monsters who gathered beneath the swinging bodies and laughed as Black people were tortured, mutilated, and killed.\nThey were, to a person, awful human beings \u2014 all of them. No exceptions.\nIf those crowds included members of your family, then your family members were awful human beings, whether or not you choose to face that fact.\nThat\u2019s not a judgment rooted in modern \u201cwokeness.\u201d\nIt\u2019s one grounded firmly in basic human decency and immutable truth.\nBeyond the hypocrisy and the moral repugnance of the argument, it\u2019s also a stunningly ignorant position unbecoming of someone with even a seventh-grader\u2019s reasoning ability.\nThe behavior that some now rationalize \u2014 based on how \u201caccepted\u201d it was in previous periods \u2014 often violated moral standards that existed even then.\nSure, many people violated those moral standards, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that those standards existed.\nFor instance, however \u201caccepted\u201d enslavement was for many generations, it violated at least two ancient moral standards enshrined in The Ten Commandments: the admonitions against stealing and killing.\nEnslavement involved the theft of bodies and labor power, and it was known that many would die as a result of their captivity before reaching their destinations.\nThat enslavers rationalized these deaths and the stealing of people and labor \u2014 somehow squaring them with the moral standards they claimed to follow on Sundays \u2014 doesn\u2019t make their rationalizations valid.\nThe moral basis for rejecting such treatment of others was always there. They simply chose to ignore it.\nIt\u2019s not as if the human brain couldn\u2019t conceive of freedom. Most had no problem conceiving of it for themselves.\nIn the case of enslavers and their enablers, they simply ignored what their Scriptures were telling them or chose to interpret them in ways that made their evil acceptable.\nThomas Jefferson made clear that he knew well the moral standard he and his fellow enslavers were violating when he remarked, writing of slavery:\nI tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just (and) that his justice cannot sleep forever\u2026\nJefferson knew, but he did evil anyway. If he judged himself and his nation, then we surely can.\nSecond, the behavior in question, which some would now rationalize, was only \u201cacceptable\u201d back then because those in power could make it so.\nIt wasn\u2019t because there was some universally different morality in existence at that time.\nAmerican enslavement was \u201cacceptable\u201d because most whites deemed it such.\nSame with segregation.\nBut these things were never acceptable to their victims.\nLikewise, marital rape was \u201cacceptable\u201d until recently in most states. Indeed, it wasn\u2019t even considered rape.\nMen could force their wives into sex without concern for being prosecuted.\nBut is that because of a previously different morality or because men had the power to impose that system?\nTo ask the question is to answer it.\nWomen never thought it was OK to be raped. But they didn\u2019t have the power to illegalize the practice.\nIn other words, husbands who raped their wives were always monsters.\nThey deserve to be thought of as such, because rape was always wrong.\nWhether or not the men in question understood that, the women they violated did.\nThe capacity for understanding was always there, however much it was smothered under layers of rationalization by evil people intent on doing evil things.\nThird, even in those eras when certain things we now condemn were widely practiced, plenty objected, even among the dominant group.\nDuring the days of enslavement, not only Black people but also white abolitionists saw the system\u2019s iniquity.\nDuring segregation, many whites opposed racial discrimination \u2014 not as many as should have, but more than a few, to be sure.\nEven among the rationalizing group, some saw the moral truth clearly.\nAgain, this means anyone could have.\nAs such, we can and should judge persons in past eras not merely by today\u2019s standards but by the standards that some were willing to follow, even at the time in question.\nShorter version: Most of our forebears sucked even by standards that existed in their own time.\nYour ancestors were assholes. Deal with it.\nIn fact, to deny this point would require one to take an incredibly irrational position regarding the abolitionist and civil rights movements.\nSo, for instance, we know that those movements were challenging the social norms of their day \u2014 slavery and Jim Crow \u2014 to create new standards of greater equality and freedom.\n\u2026we can and should judge persons in past eras not merely by today\u2019s standards but by the standards that some were willing to follow, even at the time in question\nWe also know they were movements involving a minority of the population fighting against more powerful majorities. Thankfully, they won important victories and did force changes in American society.\nBut if we accept the notion that people \u201cin those days\u201d shouldn\u2019t be judged retroactively by today\u2019s standards, how do we make sense of these movements that were judging them at the time?\nWas Dr. King irrational for calling out segregation and racism in 1963 just because \u201cit was accepted\u201d by most white people?\nWas Frederick Douglass wrong for doing the same with enslavement?\nTo the extent no one (other than an overt racist) would say yes to these questions, how can anyone suggest that we today shouldn\u2019t judge enslavers and segregationists?\nIf it was acceptable and laudable to challenge those behaviors and attitudes at the time, as these brave voices did, why would it be unacceptable now?\nIt wouldn\u2019t be.\nAnyone who suggests otherwise is simply too addled by blind patriotism or devotion to their own shitty families to hold either their nation or ancestors to a consistent ethical standard.\nAnd if you think rehabilitating your country\u2019s reputation or that of your great-grandparents is more important than moral truth, you aren\u2019t someone who can be trusted to make political decisions in the present.\nWe need to face the facts.\nAs scholar, activist (and old friend of mine), Lance Hill puts it: America is a crime scene where white people constantly tamper with the evidence.\nIt\u2019s time to stop and simply go where the evidence leads us.", "comment_count": 46, "like_count": 1602, "created_time": 1650230037635, "comment": [{"user_id": "de76cf9829db", "comment_time": 1650230037635, "comment": "Thank you for sharing!"}, {"user_id": "83b7e4a6606b", "comment_time": 1650506869699, "comment": "I think this article conflates \u201cmoral relativism\u201d with character judgement.

If you didn\u2019t engage them, they wouldn\u2019t keep talking to you.\u201d\nIt is nighttime and it is bitterly cold and I\u2019m at a bus stop with my then-boyfriend. We\u2019ve just left a performance of some sort and are trying to get home but our evening has been interrupted and it is, apparently, my fault.\nAn intoxicated man stands about two feet away, swaying like a thin tree in the wind, staring at me with a fixed gaze. He appears to be living in extreme poverty, most likely sleeping outside tonight, and, just moments ago, I was worrying about how he\u2019d stay warm.\nI\u2019m still worried, but now I am also annoyed, mostly on behalf of my boyfriend, who is visibly upset by the encounter.\nThe man\u2019s knuckles are wrapped around a garbage can and his other hand is beckoning me with one finger. He has already spoken to me, too close and smelling like hard liquor, about my body and my appearance. He keeps pinballing from his garbage can to me and back again, prompting me to talk to him. This goes on for at least 10 minutes, during which I am courteous and my boyfriend grows more and more anxious.\nThe sexual harassment isn\u2019t what irritates me. For me, this isn\u2019t frightening or even that uncomfortable. This is every single day. I leave the house. Men talk to me. I hold my breath and I am polite and I am unshakable and then I get home. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat.\nWhat annoys me is the fact that I am being blamed for this moment in time, for this interaction. While this isn\u2019t new to me\u2014this is the price of living my life, of going to things\u2014it is new for him. And he doesn\u2019t enjoy it.\n\u201cJust don\u2019t talk to him. He\u2019ll go away,\u201d my boyfriend tells me again. His face is pale and he is clearly nervous and perhaps downright afraid of what the man will do to us \u2014 to him \u2014 next.\nI\u2019m not afraid, because I\u2019m doing what I have learned to do to keep us both safe. The exact thing that my boyfriend thinks is causing this interaction is the thing that I know will ensure it is over more promptly and without incident.\nI remain courteous as we wait.\nSometimes when I get home, I tell my boyfriend about the persistence of interactions like this, the pervasiveness of it. He seems aghast, but I get the feeling that he, like of a lot of men, think I\u2019m exaggerating.\nI can\u2019t entirely blame him; most people have a hard time grasping the gravitas of a situation until they, themselves, have experienced it. He\u2019s never seen this happen in public. He\u2019s never had it happen to him.\nAnd, of course, he has told me to just ignore it because that seems like the most logical approach. When you ignore things, they go away, right?\nThis time, though, he bears witness. His presence at my side does nothing to dissuade the drunk man because, as much as men like to think that just being there is enough to protect women from other men, that is rarely the case.\nExample: The time a man on a Greyhound bus put his hand on my leg and physically blocked my path as I tried to wriggle away while the man on his side, someone\u2019s white-collar business dad lured in by the promise of nicer seats and outlets on the bus, looked worried but said nothing.\nExample: The time a customer cornered me in the alley outside of the restaurant where I worked during a cigarette break and two college men lingered with a concerned air, but ultimately decided to keep walking.\nExample: The time a man who was visibly having a psychotic break swung a padlock at me and threatened to \u201csmash your face, bitch\u201d despite the company of an extremely nervous male friend who was very graciously walking me home \u201cfor safety.\u201d He asks after the fact how I could remain so calm and I just shrug.\nExample: The time when, walking with my current partner, a drunk man stumbled from a bar and waved a golf club in our direction and it was me that he locked his eyes upon, but my partner who was the most upset. I oblige the imposition just long enough to steer us into a bodega until the man leaves.\nIt\u2019s hard to even be disturbed by an occurrence that happens so often because if I were to allow myself to feel it every time, I would never be able to leave the house again \u2014 something I\u2019m reminded of whenever a man is present for an incident like this and is so very visibly shaken and at a loss for what to do or how to react.\nSeeing it happen this time, though, doesn\u2019t seem to breed empathy in my boyfriend. Instead, it confirms everything that he believes. I didn\u2019t ignore the man, and now he\u2019s here, in our presence, in our life, wicking up our time and attention like water. I smiled and I was polite and that is why he talked to me \u2014 though of course, I was paying exactly no attention to him before he began to demand mine. I was doing exactly nothing to invite this man\u2019s leering and sexually aggressive language, except for existing as a woman, which for many men is more than enough.\n\u201cSeriously, stop being nice to him. You\u2019re making it worse.\u201d\nThis conclusion exhausts me because we have been over this and he should know better and I am tired of holding the hands of men in my life while also keeping my fists clenched as men I don\u2019t know penetrate my space and expect my time.\nIt\u2019s also decidedly untrue. He doesn\u2019t know what makes it worse, because he hasn\u2019t lived it every day. He has gathered much less anecdotal data than I have.\nHe is a man who is, for all intents and purposes, considered one of the \u201cgood ones.\u201d He participated in Walk a Mile in Her Shoes. He has seen the Vagina Monologues. He has read Judith Butler and bell hooks and he knows about the male gaze and the Bechdel Test. He would never harass a woman on the street. He would never blame the victim.\nExcept right now and every time it happens to me. This is still my fault. I did this. That man is making my boyfriend uncomfortable because of me.\nThis is the thing about being an ally \u2014 it requires very little nuance of understand. Catching the sexism in a beer commercial? You\u2019re an ally. Lamenting the gender wage gap? You\u2019re an ally.\nBlaming women for the behavior of men in everyday occurences of sexual harassment? Well\u2026\nIt is one of the few times in life when actions are relatively silent, but words are cacophonous.\nThe men who yell repulsive things about me from their cars or on the street. The men who follow me home. The men whose hands slip up the back of my skirt as I squeeze by for a seat on the bus. The men who wave their limp, rubbery genitalia at me in broad daylight. The men who have said they loved me and also raised a hand to me.\nThey do it, the world still seems to think (despite so. many. articles. like this.) not because we have told them all their lives that my body is their property and my attention their right, but because I have smiled or dressed or walked or existed in a way that gave them the green light.\nNevermind the fact that talking, smiling, and existing in a passive, polite, and permissive way has actually saved me.\nNevermind all of the times when a man has turned quickly, like flipping over a playing card, from seemingly warm and charming to frightful and alarming when I even implied that I didn\u2019t want to talk.\nNevermind the fact that one time a man at a bar whose advances had just become too much to stomach literally spat in my face when I told him I was really just trying to read alone.\nNevermind the fact that telling a lecherous man on the corner not to fucking talk to me one day when I was just so tired of being treated as a consumable good prompted him to show me his knife and tell me to be grateful for his \u201ccompliments, fat bitch.\u201d\nNevermind the assumptions that come from a simple no:\nYou think you\u2019re too good for me? or What, so you\u2019re a lesbian. or Didn\u2019t anyone ever teach you it\u2019s not polite to ignore people?\nFunnily, no, and in fact, people keep telling me to do the exact opposite.\nAnd then there\u2019s that question \u2014 shouldn\u2019t you be grateful? Doesn\u2019t it feel good to have so many people interrupting your day just to show their interest? Wouldn\u2019t anyone love to be showered with compliments at unexpected moments?\nBut of course the answer is no, because the majority of the words that I hear are not meant to be kind. They are meant to be corrosive.\nMany men go through the world feeling invisible, which is the fault of toxic masculinity and also the fault of their fellow men. When your ears are, as a woman, full of \u201ccompliments\u201d that sound more like threats, every advance becomes just noise, every encounter a potentially dangerous or uncomfortable situation.\nWe are told to ignore sexual harassment\u2026unless it\u2019s from a nice guy. We are expected to know the difference immediately and react appropriately. We often get it wrong because there is no right answer.\nAnd yet, it\u2019s men who tell us how best to handle these situations. When in fact, it is we, the victims, who know best.\nIn my life, it has become abundantly clear to me that there is no way for me to end the constant barrage of unwanted conversation and touching and sexualization of my body. There is nothing that I can do to stop giving tiny pieces of myself and my time on this earth to the men who demand it because there is nothing that I can do to stop the demand. That\u2019s not on me.\nIt happens regardless of what I\u2019m wearing, regardless of how I feel, regardless of how I move through the world. It\u2019s not what I do and it\u2019s not how I act. It is my presence \u2014 and just that!\nSometimes it\u2019s with good intentions. Sometimes it\u2019s not. Sometimes it\u2019s with no intention at all other than to interrupt and interject \u2014 someone just has something they want to say or do to me and they can see exactly no reason not to say it or do it.\nIt\u2019s not a question of if it will happen, but when and how often. How many times today. How many times for the rest of my life. How many will go sour. How many will end with me in danger.\nI can\u2019t make it stop and I can\u2019t reduce the volume. What I can do is ensure that it\u2019s not worse.\nAnd so I smile. And I make conversation. And I am charming and sweet and I even swallow hot stomach acid to choke out the words \u201cthank you,\u201d because these are the actions that, it has been proven to me over and over by trial and error, work best.\nA small smile heads off the rage. A wave back keeps the situation civil. A forced laugh keeps the man outside of the drugstore from following me any further. A full-fledged conversation when I am trapped in line helps me suss out whether or not this person is violent, or just overly-friendly.\nIt\u2019s tiresome and it\u2019s not ideal. It leaves me wary and makes me guarded. It prompts me to consider every single interaction I have in public.\nThere\u2019s an innate unfairness to this; for the men who harass me, who invade my space and demand my time and attention, who grant themselves permission to touch me, this is a pleasant experience. They feel listened to and visible and valued and validated.\nIt has the opposite effect on me.\nAnd yes, I know that in doing this \u2014 in using courtesy as a weapon of self defense \u2014 that I am also actively enabling the behavior and I am encouraging it further and I am part of the problem.\nBut my body is not the battleground for this fight and my personal safety is not a currency I am willing to exchange for ending it because even if I cash it in it will persist.\nI would rather get home safe at night than take up the charge of ending male entitlement when it stumbles my way because the truth is, my compliance doesn\u2019t cause male entitlement and my lack of compliance isn\u2019t enough to make it stop.\nIf I stop using politeness as my armor, I won\u2019t correct centuries of conditioning and acceptance and even encouragement. I won\u2019t make a man who thinks my body is his for the taking to reconsider a lifetime of training that tells him that\u2019s the case.\nI won\u2019t end anything except, potentially, my own life.\nIf I stop complying, the most likely outcome is that I will harmed. The most likely outcome is that nothing will change except instead of being irritated by harassment, I will go back to being actively afraid or, you know, worse.\nFor this reason, each day, I decide to be temporarily ok being part of the problem because I know that my part is the absolute smallest part. I also decide to be part of the problem because the alternative \u2014 \u201djust ignoring it\u201d \u2014 is part of the problem.\nOf course, telling women to \u201cjust ignore it\u201d is another way of telling women to be quiet. If we\u2019re quiet, we\u2019ll be safe. If we\u2019re quiet, they\u2019ll go away.\nIf we\u2019re quiet, all of the men who don\u2019t harass women, who don\u2019t help themselves to our bodies, can feel better about their own silence.\nOn this exact night, with this exact man who should know better because he prides himself on understanding and hearing women, the tiredness overwhelms me and I can\u2019t be part of it anymore.\n\u201cNo, actually, he won\u2019t. He won\u2019t go away and he won\u2019t leave us alone and actually \u2018engaging\u2019 is one of the best ways I know how to keep myself safe.\u201d\nAnd we\u2019re off.\nFor the entire bus ride home (the bus finally comes) I unload all of little scraps of indignity that I have packed around with me for all of these years. And I don\u2019t care if he hears it or learns a goddamn thing because mostly I just need to say these things. These things that I have said above and many more.\nThings like \u201charassment is not the same as giving a compliment\u201d and \u201ctelling women to be silent does nothing to solve the problem\u201d and \u201csaying that my actions cause this is exactly what we mean when we say \u2018victim-blaming.\u2019\u201d\nIn the years since that night, I have told this exact story many times, to many men, in large part because being silent \u2014 just ignoring it \u2014 doesn\u2019t make women safer and I need you to know that.\nI just need you to know that.\nWhen men are quick to remind us that not all men harass women, I\u2019m quicker to remind them that all women (really, all) have experienced this at least once, but more likely, they have experienced it many, many more times than that.\nAnd as many times as we\u2019ve been party to this \u2014 as many times as someone has touched us, yelled at us, hit on us, hit us, raped us , spat on us, stalked us, threatened us, propositioned us \u2014 we\u2019ve also been told to just ignore it.\nThe truth is, we don\u2019t have the luxury to ignore harassment. We engage, we\u2019re kind, because that is what keeps us safe.\nAnd now it\u2019s time for everyone to engage.\nIf you\u2019re tired of hearing about women being harassed, tired of us sharing our stories about it, maybe that\u2019s because you\u2019ve been ignoring it, and we don\u2019t believe that you should have that luxury anymore, either.", "comment_count": 220, "like_count": 8495, "created_time": 1456164985449, "comment": [{"user_id": "9d884bfe6887", "comment_time": 1456164985449, "comment": "Thank you for sharing!"}, {"user_id": "1a4b5b06d10", "comment_time": 1456269393124, "comment": "Your story put me in mind of an encounter of my own as a bystander to harassment.

Not twice. Thrice.\nThis is an excerpt from my Substack, which is called Crazy/Old. I started it because I wanted a different site (sorry Medium) to explore topics of mental health and the history of care. You can read way more on the site and also you can subscribe to see all of the content for a meager amount of money that will help me keep doing this kind of odd stuff.\nThe mysterious all-purpose soap with the lengthy label has been a staple in crunchy households for ages. Where I grew up, in Eugene, Oregon, it\u2019s common for people to bathe their babies with it, only to turn around and wash dishes with it. Dr. Bronner\u2019s All-One Castile Soap \u2014 which is made to be heavily diluted, making it both eco-and wallet-friendly \u2014 can be used on your face or the floor, your linens or your labradoodle. Seriously, if you\u2019re unfamiliar, it\u2019s time to get right with whichever savior you belong to and ask \u201chow did you not put this into my path yet?\u201d\nAlso, if you\u2019re unfamiliar, you may never have pondered over the absolutely bonkers label that wraps around this big cylindrical bottle.\nYou know the one.\nI could not, having grown up seeing these bottles at the local natural food store (shout out to Sundance), have been less shocked that the titular Dr. Bronner was not only institutionalized, but escaped.\nThe wild story of \u201cDr.\u201d Bronner\nAccording to the company website, the Heilbronners have been making soap for close to 200 years. But it was Emanuel Bronner \u201ca third- generation master soapmaker from a German-Jewish soapmaking family,\u201d who created the company we know today. Born in 1908, he seems to have a been a deeply religious and ideologically-driven individual almost from the jump. He emigrated to the United States when, led by his \u201cpowerful personality, Zionist ideals and ideas for modern soapmaking\u201d created tension with his father and uncles. Once in the U.S., he adopted the title of \u201cDoctor\u201d and no one questioned that. He was not, in fact, a doctor. He dropped the \u201cHeil\u201d from his name for, uh, obvious reasons.\n\nIn the 1940s, Bronner created a kind of philosophical manifesto. A lot of writing about Bronner talks about his ideologies and religious beliefs, but it\u2019s kind of impossible to talk about this soap crusader without mentioning the unfathomable history of trauma in his past. Both of his parents \u2014 from whom he was estranged \u2014 were murdered during the Holocaust. He was in a new county, alone, facing discrimination for his accent and his name and his faith. This dude must have felt profoundly lonesome. Which kind of explains why his writings about the collective nature of humanity were so\u2026.thorough.\nBronner\u2019s Moral ABC \u2014 the contents of the bottle label, which was published back in 2015 in a very cute little book \u2014 was his attempt at \u201ctrying at once unite the whole human race in one God faith,\u201d he said in an archival interview.\nThe messaging actually sounds pretty solid by today\u2019s standards. Espousing collective wellbeing, empathy, and caring (the label on the bottle encourages people to \u201cbe generous, fair & loving to Spaceship Earth and all its inhabitants. For we\u2019re ALL-ONE OR NONE! ALL-ONE!\u201d) as well as sustainability, the Moral ABC would fit right in on any Neo-hippie Instagram page. But in 1946, that message \u2014 or maybe the messenger \u2014 led Bronner to be institutionalized in the Elgin State Insane Asylum.\n\nA story from 1999 in the Chicago Tribute gives the best breakdown of what happened, so I\u2019m not going to try to paraphrase:\nAfter an incident in which Bronner created a disturbance in the dean\u2019s office at the University of Chicago, he was jailed. A week later, his sister signed the necessary papers, and he was taken to Elgin State Mental Hospital\u2026\n\u2026Emanuel was in Elgin for six months. On his third try, he escaped. He had no money except for $20 stolen from a purse, but he found a classified ad seeking a companion to share the drive to Los Angeles. That would be good, he thought. No one knew him there. By the time they got to Las Vegas, Bronner figured he and his companion had become friendly enough that he could reveal the fact that he was an escaped mental patient.\nAs Bronner watched the car drive off, he wondered if the roulette wheel at a nearby casino might turn what was left of the $20 into enough cash to get to Los Angeles. He was lucky, got to L.A., spent his nights sleeping on the roof of a YMCA and his days fighting forest fires for pay. Thus Dr. Bronner \u2014 the doctorate was self-awarded in honor of his deep knowledge of soapmaking \u2014 began his climb to become what later media reports would often term him, the Pope of Soap.\nYup. He spent six months in the bin (instead of doing more jail time) and tried to escape three times. What a life!\nRead the rest of this story (this one\u2019s on me!) over at my Substack.

He was a big soccer fan \u2014 which was weird in my working-class neighborhood, where the only Real Sports were football and baseball. And he used a card system, not unlike soccer referees do, to help us learn about boundaries, directions, and acceptable behavior.\nEvery student had a pocket on the wall with their name on it. In each pocket were four laminated cards: Green, yellow, red, and black.\nEveryone started with the green card in the front. If you talked out of turn, swore, neglected to pay attention, or committed any other disciplinary infraction, my teacher would flip the green card to the back, revealing the yellow card. If the bad behavior continued, he would give them a red card. You get the idea.\nSome kids \u2014 the bad kids \u2014 got a yellow or even red card every day. Most kids got a yellow card at least a couple of times each year. It was, my teacher would say, a warning.\nI got a yellow card one single time and it nearly wrecked me.\nThe crushing perfectionism of being an ADHD girl\nFrom a young age, I was wracked with anxiety about being bad. My parents were strict in a very specific, somewhat-new-age-y kind of way that included next to zero rules about cleanliness or personal hygiene, but very high expectations for critical thinking and academic success.\nWe had unruly hair, mismatched, third-hand clothes, and perfect attendance from kindergarten onward. The only day of school I missed in the entirety of elementary and middle school was when I had acute bronchitis at age 5 and had to be kept home for one day.\nWe may have looked feral, but it was very important to my parents that we were good children.\nThis was easy for my brother. It was less easy for me, and probably the hardest for my younger sister.\nFor me, appearing to be a good girl meant overcompensating for the disorganization in my head. It meant being meticulous in my outfits, often looking to whatever catalogs came in the mail for inspiration. It meant being on time or early to class, completing projects early and with exact attention to instruction, and always volunteering to help my teachers.\nIf I was assigned to read a chapter of a book and it really engrossed me, I would read the entire book in one night, sleeping little. It meant creating all kinds of mnemonic devices, shortcuts, and memorization tactics to get good grades and give the illusion that I was doing well.\nMeanwhile, the inside of my desk looked like a Staples store after a hurricane. My backpack was a disorganized mess of half-eaten snacks, papers, and books that I was too embarrassed to use in class because I\u2019d spilled juice on them.\nThe worst part of every day was when we would take a timed math test. It would be impossible for me to hide the fact that I really didn\u2019t understand the higher levels of the times table.\nAnd then there was that yellow card, which left me feeling so exposed and bare. I had gotten it for talking to a friend. We\u2019d been chatting when the teacher called the class to attention and I, deep in a child\u2019s thought, had to \u2014 had to \u2014 finish it before I turned around and paid attention. But it took just slightly too long to get the thought out and, before I could wrap it up, my teacher was saying my name and pinching the green card in my pocket.\nIt felt like the worst thing that had ever happened to me.\nDespite all of my hiding of my most unflattering qualities \u2014 needing a slower and more visual example of the math concepts, inability to listen to a lesson if it wasn\u2019t perfectly holding my attention, sensory overload when my clothes were too scratchy or hot or otherwise uncomfortable, and a motivation to get things done so that they could just be done, which often amounted to sloppy work that I would have to redo three times to make perfect \u2014 there they were, on display. I was the kind of kid who got warned.\nI was a bad kid now. Just like all the other bad ones.\nThis should have been a signal flare to the adults around me. Every single issue I was dealing with is practically textbook for childhood ADHD, especially in girls. But in the early \u201990s \u2014 and even today \u2014 the ways that girls present with ADHD are just not as easily or as quickly identified as they are in their young male counterparts.\nIn a 2014 paper published in the Primary Care Companion for CNS Disorders, researchers note a \u201clow index of clinical suspicion\u201d for girls. That\u2019s because girls are less likely than boys to have hyperactivity/impulsivity as a symptom. They mostly have inattentiveness.\nAnother common symptom in girls with ADHD is hyperfocus. They\u2019ll zoom in and lose themselves in something they find interesting, often getting fixated on an idea. This can create relatively good homework outcomes, or make a person look like a very diligent worker.\nIt can also make inattention simply look like carelessness, rather than a cognitive barrier. Hyperfocus can be used as a way to overshadow the impacts of distractibility. Girls can get really good at hiding their symptoms of inattention by hyperfixating, often weaponizing it into a tight grip on the steering wheel of their own realities.\nThis came up in the report, too. \u201cFemales with ADHD may develop better coping strategies than males to mask their symptoms.\u201d (These strategies may also mask comorbidities like anxiety and depression, which the researchers said \u201ccan lead to missed or misdiagnosis.\u201d)\nFor example, girls with ADHD may be disorganized, but it\u2019s rarely in a visible way \u2014 after all, girls are socialized to be tidy, not messy. But this creates a gripping fear of being found out. Of being exposed.\nBoys with ADHD tend to express it in ways that are disruptive in class but generally socially acceptable \u2014 hyperactivity, fidgeting, loud conversations at inappropriate times. But with girls, it\u2019s usually less noticeable and more inward-facing, like biting their nails or braiding their hair. A girl with ADHD who is withdrawn because she is often lost in thought is viewed as shy, but not unusual.\nIn many ways, the things that girls are socialized to do are perfect at masking ADHD symptoms. Unfortunately, that\u2019s created the problem we have today, where lack of understanding and diagnosis has created a vacuum of assistance.\nCloaking myself in the appearance of goodness\nFor me, this attitude persisted well into college. While I transmitted my hyperfixation into a nearly all-consuming eating disorder, I was so desperate to continue keep my grades high that I would record myself reading flash cards to listen to on a Walkman on the elliptical machine. I would conjugate verbs while I ran.\nThis, too, should have been a sign. My roommate would close herself in our dorm for hours just reading a textbook in silence. I loved to learn. But I didn\u2019t love to learn like that. All of my best studying was done in movement. In lectures, I took frantic notes because the act of writing something down again and again helped me remember it, even when my mind was wandering. I needed to be doing something.\nYears and years later, I realized that I could learn anything from an audiobook or podcast, so long as I was able to also do something, like walk or unload the dishwasher. But sitting down with a book (unless it was a very, very good book) would never be the best way for me to take in new information. This has been a game-changer for me \u2014 but it wasn\u2019t available when I was younger.\nMy fear of being perceived as bad \u2014 or lazy, or unintelligent \u2014 pushed me to be good. But it was my ADHD and the behaviors that come with it that gave me the solid jolt into perfectionism. I had no idea that all of the things I was fighting against had a name or research or a treatment. I just knew that being the kind of girl I was when unchecked \u2014 a little wild, a little spacey, but a lot interested in learning \u2014 was bad. And I would have done just about anything to hide it.\n", "comment_count": 5, "like_count": 391, "created_time": 1649698554023, "comment": [{"user_id": "9d884bfe6887", "comment_time": 1649698554023, "comment": "Thank you for sharing!"}, {"user_id": "f6e32f81cdbf", "comment_time": 1651457377712, "comment": "I know a few women with ADHD IRL and we all had similar experiences.

Hint: It\u2019s Both", "content": "Do we really want women self-diagnosing ADHD through TikTok?\n\nI\u2019m not a heavy user of TikTok for many reasons, but mostly because I\u2019m in my 30s and too far gone to learn a new social media platform. In the last year or so, though, I\u2019ve been seeing more and more TikTok videos appear in my other feeds \u2014 and I\u2019ve been noticing an interesting trend.\nOf course, my friends and family often send me TikTok videos of things they know I\u2019ll enjoy \u2014 gardening ideas, cleaning hacks, snarky commentary about influencer culture. But this is different. This is a very specific, popular, and potentially dangerous genre of TikTok that can only be described as \u201cADHD Explainers Designed for Clarity but Probably Ending in Self-Diagnosis.\u201d\nI want to be clear: There\u2019s no shame in finding solace online, especially if you live with a neurodivergence (either suspected or diagnosed) that can make day-to-day life overwhelming or isolating. Many, many users have discovered a community they didn\u2019t realize they needed in online spaces. These communities can be massively educational, comforting, and validating.\n#ADHDTok, though, does present possible risks \u2014 and it highlights some of the most glaring issues with American health care.\nWhat is #ADHDTok?\nTikTok videos about ADHD are plentiful and, like all user-created content, run the gamut of quality and factuality. In general, though, they tend to follow one of a handful of formulas and are typically meant to highlight or illustrate a lesser-known ADHD symptom or behavior. Issues like hyperfocus, anecdotal communication, and time blindness are popular fodder under the widely used hashtag #ADHDTok.\nUsers may explain what the media gets wrong about ADHD, describe uncommon symptoms a person might experience, or present humorous reenactments of how their ADHD brain functions (or doesn\u2019t). Some do important work of destigmatizing ADHD while breaking down the why behind the behavior. Others are just meant to show what life is like with ADHD. And of course, the more users click and watch, the more TikTok will serve up. Soon, a frequent #ADHDTok visitor might find their home feed flooded with more of this kind of content.\nAnd while most of the content creators would urge that these videos are not meant to diagnose anyone, fans frequently comment that learning about these facets of ADHD has convinced them that they do, in fact, have this condition.\n\u201cAs I delved deeper into the rabbit hole of ADHD content, I came across more and more specific symptoms \u2014 perfectionism, disordered auditory processing, and skewed circadian rhythm \u2014 that, until watching these videos, I didn\u2019t even realize were signs of ADHD,\u201d wrote Charlotte Columbo for Insider. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether stumbling across it was fate or TikTok\u2019s scarily accurate algorithm, but it came when I needed it the most.\u201d\nColumbus Monthly\u2019s Emma Frankart Henterly shared a similar light bulb moment.\n\u201cWhat I\u2019d previously thought were quirks of my personality \u2014 perfectionism, impulsivity, emotional outbursts, an always-messy desk or room or car, constantly misplacing things and running into furniture or doorways, a tendency to start talking mid-thought or out of turn, fidgeting, procrastination, forgetting common words midsentence \u2014 all of these\u2026were manifestations of untreated ADHD.\u201d\n\nFor these women \u2014 and it is most often women who are diagnosed late in life \u2014 finding ADHD content on TikTok was a kind of salvation, helping them finally put together the messy pieces of their lives and minds.\nPotential pitfalls of #ADHDTok\nThese videos aren\u2019t inherently harmful. A lot of people find comfort in them and feel seen or understood when they watch others act out familiar scenarios. But TikTok videos are, by their nature, not ideal for conversations around mental illness. They necessarily lack nuance and are entirely one-sided \u2014 one person talking at another, not with, as a therapist might do.\nIn spite of their shortcomings, these videos are exceptionally popular \u2014 there are billions of views on tags like #ADHD and #ADHDTok. People, and especially women in their 20s and 30s, are finding these videos and, in turn, finding themselves. Even if they\u2019ve never been able to go to a therapist or ask a psychiatrist, they\u2019re finding themselves exposed to the language of these spaces, the symptoms of various conditions, and, perhaps the most important, a community among a theorized diagnosis.\nA self-diagnosis of ADHD may not be serious. At its most harmless, it may encourage some soul-searching or research. But it can also lead to problems like drug-seeking behavior. More than 10 years ago, researchers found that as many as a quarter of patients could be feigning ADHD symptoms in an attempt to get prescriptions for the controlled stimulants used to treat the condition.\nIt can also lead to misdiagnosis or missed diagnosis of mental illness. An article in ADDitude noted that \u201ccertain symptoms such as fatigue, difficulty concentrating, and under-stimulation are common attributes of both depression and ADHD. Similarly, sleep problems, hyperfocus, impulsivity and emotional dysregulation overlap with mania symptoms in bipolar disorder. Thus it\u2019s common for ADHD to be misdiagnosed as a mood disorder, and vice versa.\u201d\nThat means that just walking in with a pre-established diagnosis (\u201cI have ADHD, TikTok told me so!\u201d) could actually make it harder to get an accurate professional diagnosis.\nThose who skip the diagnosis altogether are also at risk. Medications like Adderall and Ritalin have long been used recreationally by students looking to cram or employees trying to get the job done. The first time I ever tried this was at work in a coffee shop when a co-worker offered me a tab so that we could clean quickly and clock off early.\nWhy do folks need to self-diagnose, anyway?\nThat Americans turn to alternatives to traditional medicine \u2014 looking to everything from essential oils to YouTube yoga \u2014 is completely predictable. Health care costs in the United States have continued to skyrocket. We\u2019re not getting more for our money, though. A shortage of medical professionals means longer and longer waits for care and fewer options for lower-income folks. Mental health care isn\u2019t even covered under many insurance packages, putting it out of reach for many Americans.\nSo it\u2019s absolutely unsurprising that users have turned to TikTok \u2014 a free platform that\u2019s already right there in their phone \u2014 to find information, confirmation, and even diagnosis. It\u2019s become a compelling space for medical and therapeutic information. And, with advertisers capitalizing on it, it\u2019s likely to increase.\nMany adults get diagnosed with ADHD late in life, or self-diagnosed on social media, because their schools didn\u2019t have enough mental health or psychological support for their students. Instead of allowing girls to slip through the cracks, labeled as \u201cperfectionists\u201d or \u201cnervous,\u201d our public schools could circumvent the need for this level of self-diagnosis.\nWhich is to say, in a nation where there was ample, affordable mental health care, these TikTok videos might not be so critical in diagnosis.\nThat is not our universe, though. And it means that we all have to pay special attention when we\u2019re scrolling. Users need to be extra-careful to take the content that they see on TikTok (or anywhere online, even here!) as the personal experience of one person, not as a sweeping statement about all people with ADHD.", "comment_count": 1, "like_count": 132, "created_time": 1645753990544, "comment": [{"user_id": "9d884bfe6887", "comment_time": 1645753990544, "comment": "Thank you for sharing!"}, {"user_id": "67f8ab83fd3e", "comment_time": 1648947535841, "comment": "As a clinician it seems that the primary missing ingredient in self diagnosis is the big picture of human functioning you get from studying clinical psychology.

Finding Meaningful Work Is\nThe motivation behind the great resignation\nPhoto: Valeria Boltneva/Pexels\nIt\u2019s been three months since I\u2019d quit my nursing job.\nA year ago, I was dreaming of this life, one of waking up, working my own hours, and doing anything else I felt like.\nI admit I didn\u2019t want to quit my job. I was forced to due to certain circumstances. I felt extremely burnt out as an Emergency nurse caring for patients who didn\u2019t care about themselves. So in the past couple of months, I\u2019ve been contemplating why I quit my job. Was it because I hated the job? Or was it because I wanted to do something else? Or was it both?\nOr maybe I was influenced by what I saw on social media. On every platform you go to, someone is telling us how they quit their job, and it\u2019s been the best decision they\u2019ve ever had in their lives. There\u2019s a whole subreddit (/antiwork) on it.\nBut for me, it was different. I loved caring for my patients. And it made me think, maybe the goal of the great resignation or antiwork isn\u2019t to quit your job.\nMaybe it\u2019s to find or create meaningful work for yourself.\nDefining meaningful work\nBeing an Emergency nurse was meaningful for me.\nEven though 80% of my tasks weren\u2019t related to caring for a true Emergency (think: the person\u2019s airway, breathing, or circulation is compromised), 20% of what I did as a nurse was meaningful.\nFor instance, giving someone a pain medication was meaningful for me. While I don\u2019t know what others\u2019 pain feels like, I know what pain feels. And having the power to remove or reduce their feeling of someone\u2019s pain feels rewarding.\nAnd when there\u2019s a true emergency, resuscitating someone is even more meaningful.\nWhat\u2019s not meaningful is the B.S. that comes with the job. There are some patients who feel entitled and abuse the workers and the system. And to add insult to the injury, governments cap the nurses\u2019 pay both in U.S. and Canada.\nSo even though part of your work is meaningful, the 80% that causes stress, anxiety, and depression causes you to leave.\nWhy is it so difficult to find meaningful work?\nWhether it\u2019s our society, our parents, or the media, we\u2019ve been influenced by our definitions of success. Growing up in a third-world country, I worked hard to graduate from university and land a good-paying job. But it turns out our dream jobs don\u2019t necessarily equate to what we (as individuals) may believe is meaningful.\nWe believe that having a prestigious job title or having the big five company name on our resume is what it\u2019s going to make work meaningful. But it\u2019s not.\nYou realize that there is so much more to life than spending 30% of your waking life at work.\nAnd because you had a societal expectation, you didn\u2019t learn to question the people around you. You didn\u2019t question your parents about the way they lived. You didn\u2019t question the tasks that you had to do. You did them because you were asked to. And you were afraid of speaking up because of being reprimanded. Or maybe you did, and the answer they gave you was, \u201cbecause that\u2019s the way we\u2019ve always done it.\u201d\nUntil you\u2019ve had enough.\nAfter experiencing mundane, boring, and soul-sucking jobs, you slowly search for meaningful work, which can include:\nThe freedom to work anywhere in the world (hello, remote work)\nThe ability to spend more time with friends and families\nThe ability to not work on a Wednesday\nThe people who\u2019ve quit their 100K to 500K salaried jobs to design their life teach us that money can\u2019t buy happiness.\nThe search for meaningful work\nAccording to the Census Bureau, the number of businesses registered in the U.S. raised 24% during the pandemic.\nPeople don\u2019t come to entrepreneurship because they think it\u2019s cool. At least, I hope not. But, entrepreneurship paves the way for meaningful work. It gives people the meaning of purpose.\nFor instance, I quit my nursing job because I learned how to write. I took an online writing course that sped up my knowledge about writing. In less than six months, I landed my first client as a freelance writer. And it snowballed to other clients.\nNow, I want to share how I got to a point where I did not know how to write to writing for a living.\nAnd if I can help one other person do that, wouldn\u2019t that be meaningful?\nI know what it feels like to feel stuck in a job you hate. I know what it feels like not to have an option. So by sharing my knowledge through social media, I\u2019m doing work that feels meaningful to me.\nThere\u2019s a point to what I\u2019m doing.\nEven though sharing my knowledge doesn\u2019t directly bring me money, it gives me a sense of purpose.\nAnd for me, that\u2019s enough.\nSo, what truly creates meaningful work?\nMeaningful work creates a positive change \u2014 whether it\u2019s a change in thinking, perspective, or experience of the person.\nIn one episode of a Netflix show called \u201cSweet Magnolia,\u201d there\u2019s a character who\u2019s a chef. This chef is quite successful but unhappy. She felt lost about who she was and felt like she pushed everyone away who wanted her best.\nShe went to talk to a pastor, where the chef was asked, \u201cWhat makes you happy?\u201d\nHer answer was so simple yet so profound.\n\u201cI love cooking. I love it when my food makes me happy. And people gather around my food.\u201d\nAnd that line truly hit me. Cooking for people doesn\u2019t give me the same feeling as that character, but I know when your work is appreciated.\nI love it when people message me, letting me know that my work has impacted them somehow.\nIt might be worth thinking that a job and meaningful can be mutually exclusive.\nAnd maybe a better way to approach life is to find a job that pays the bills, in my case, freelance writing, and do meaningful work on the side (i.e., create YouTube videos) until one day, they intersect.\nWhat about you?

You Want to Be Creative\n\u201cDon\u2019t taint something you love with the need to make money from it\u201d\nPhoto by Anna Shvets from Pexels\nI thought quitting my job was the answer to what I sought called freedom.\nLike every other millennial out there, I was one of those who wanted to make a living doing \u201cwhat they love.\u201d So I worked for more than a year to do it. On my days off as an Emergency nurse during the pandemic, I wrote until I managed to turn it into a profitable writing business.\nThere was only one problem.\nAfter six months of doing it, I started to resent writing.\nI didn\u2019t like writing for others, and it didn\u2019t bring me more joy than when I gave pain medications to patients who needed them.\nSo, that begs the question, did I really want to become an entrepreneur, or was I just influenced by what I saw on social media?\nAnd maybe you\u2019ve experienced this too.\nThe desire to become an entrepreneur\nWhen I was a kid, I grew up surrounded by my family starting businesses.\nThey started businesses but were never successful in the long run. My parents had a computer shop where people paid to use desktop computers. Laptops weren\u2019t a thing then, only desktops in your house or computer caf\u00e9s. My grandpa tried to open up a small Japanese-themed restaurant in the Philippines.\nTo this day, my dad has tried over ten different business ideas, and none of them truly took off.\nI had this desire to be the person that finally did it.\nTo finally be the one to start a business and be successful doing it so that I can provide back to my family.\nSo during the pandemic, I tried different side hustles to escape my nursing job \u2014 from coaching, paid community memberships, and freelance writing.\nI thought freelance writing would be the thing that I was going to be successful at.\nBut it turns out I enjoyed writing as a hobby more than monetizing it and making it my primary main source of income.\nWhat entrepreneurship means to me\nFreelancing isn\u2019t entrepreneurship, but it is a way to get there.\nFreelancing is when you directly serve your clients as if you have multiple employers all at once. But to get paid, you\u2019re still exchanging your time for money. And now, you\u2019re putting away your pension, taxes, and other stuff by yourself.\nAs an entrepreneur, you are the visionary of your business, and you delegate most of your tasks away so that the business can exist without you.\nIn my freelancing business, I enjoyed the writing part, so I couldn\u2019t possibly outsource that. But I also had to look for my clients, send out my pitches, collect payment and do it again and again.\nI wanted the freedom to write from wherever whenever I wanted.\nWhen I was in my nursing job, I had one of those two. I wrote about whatever I wanted, and I was the happiest.\nBut when I had the freedom to write from where I wanted, I lost my ability to write whatever I wanted. Whenever I wrote for clients, I lost the energy to write for myself.\nI wanted to put my best foot forward. After all, I was getting paid for it.\nBut it defeated the purpose of starting a side hustle while I was doing nursing.\nI created a new job that I wanted to escape from.\nMaybe I don\u2019t want to become an entrepreneur, maybe I just want to be a creative\nSocial media has made it seem like everyone needs to be an entrepreneur.\nIf you\u2019re not, you have this gut-wrenching feeling like, \u201cwhat are you doing with your life?\u201d But going through the ups and downs of freelancing made me realize that maybe I just want to write for fun.\nI want to keep my writing passion for myself and help others without expecting monetary returns from it.\nAfter all, I was the happiest when I wrote on my days off as a nurse.\nLike right now, I\u2019m in a coffee shop, and I\u2019m on my day off as a travel nurse. I don\u2019t have to worry about the money. I don\u2019t have to worry about how I will get paid.\nIn Derek Siver\u2019s book, Hell Yeah or No, he talked about how he often gets asked how to make money doing what you love, to which he answers,\n\u201cDon\u2019t expect your job to fulfill your emotional needs. Don\u2019t taint something you love with the need to make money from it.\nDon\u2019t try to make your job your whole life. Don\u2019t try to make your art your sole income.

The extensive libraries and multi-platform support allow you to modify, modularize, and iterate quickly. One handy technique that can save you headaches and make your systems more secure is using command-line arguments (CLAs). Often we only consider using these after the application reaches a certain level of complexity or requires a UI for release, but implementing them early can actually help you write better code and close up security holes. Let\u2019s look at a few reasons why, and then demo some code (scroll on down to section 4 if you just want to see the \u2018how\u2019).\n1. Better Design from the Beginning\nIf we\u2019re just building some quick automation, or prototyping an in-house application, it\u2019s often tempting to just hard-code parameters and resist abstraction to save time in the short-term. But time invested in design and modularity often pays huge dividends, whether you find yourself needing to refactor frequently to incorporate changes, or the time is lost to debugging as the program grows. A solid foundation always saves time.\nCommand line arguments are a great way to force yourself to consider what parameters you might want to specify at runtime/deployment, which is also a great starting point for making your code modular, i.e. reusable and flexible (not to mention easier to debug). Using well-named variables for these will increase the code\u2019s readability, and allow you to iterate more quickly with less errors. Plus, even if you don\u2019t need them at first, it\u2019s often much more annoying and time-consuming to go back later and modify the code.\nOne common example is processing files. Python is great for data analysis applications like logfile parsing, text filtering, scientific simulations, etc: if you\u2019re going to download anything or use a local file, just go ahead and make that filename or URL a command-line argument. It speeds up early testing, and the associated infrastructure makes it both more portable and easily extensible (if you later need to process multiple files or a directory for example).\n2. More Flexibility = Less Time Wasted\nA huge benefit to command-line arguments is the efficient flexibility they allow. It\u2019s not always easy to anticipate your own future use-cases, but you\u2019ll develop that intuition with experience\u2026and adding some CLA infrastructure in early will nearly always help. \nA commonly-seen example is the use of boolean \u201cflag\u201d arguments to turn features on (or off), e.g. verbose output or error logging. Using \u2018option\u2019 arguments lets you specify a string for input during invocation (which you can interpret as an integer in Python if you like). Familiar uses here include specifying a file or folder name for reading or writing, or how many lines of a file to display.\nSometimes CLA\u2019s can even be worth it just for debugging purposes as well- maybe you don\u2019t intend to change the URL for API calls after deployment, but you\u2019d like to test several different ones in a dev environment first. Allowing your program to read this in could save you from re-deploying the code each time just to make the URL changes- and it could help you automate the testing, as you could wrap test code around the script, and programmatically invoke it with each URL as an argument (e.g. using a library like subprocess).\n3. Best Practices for Security\nIf your script or app uses credentials (e.g. username/password, an API key, etc) to interact with other systems, or maybe has private internal URIs, it\u2019s best not to hardcode any of these. It\u2019s too easy to forget and upload them to a public Github repository or have an unaware colleague deploy the code to an unsecured server, not knowing there\u2019s sensitive info in the source itself. \nSetting these options at runtime is generally more efficient anyway, as credentials can change, API keys can expire, or custom endpoints can be updated, all of which would force a full redeployment of the code instead of just restarting the program and passing in the new information.\nIf you have multiple environment variables (i.e. other than credentials) that\u2019d you like to set in this way, sometimes using a \u2018config\u2019 file is a better option. You can load the necessary info into a simple text file, and then pass the name (and path) of that file into your script with just one argument. Just don\u2019t upload this config file to your github, or leave it unsecured!\n4. Okay, I\u2019m Convinced: Let\u2019s See Some Code\nThe simplest way to do this is pretty straightforward: with just the sys module, we can get direct access to an array that contains all the arguments provided. Just like in C code, the first argument is the name of the program itself, and the subsequent elements in the list are any arguments that were provided. So, it would look like this-\nimport sys\nprogram_name = sys.argv[0]\nfirst_argument = sys.argv[1]\nsecond_argument = sys.argv[2]\nthird_argument = sys.argv[3]\n\u2026etc. \nThis is a good method for small scripts with maybe one or two arguments that you\u2019ll just use personally, or maybe with close friends and family, but you\u2019ll probably want some better features if it\u2019s any more complex or you plan to release it for general use- as you can see, this method does not provide any features for labeling or naming arguments (e.g. \u2014- option or -f ).\nYou could certainly use this array access to write your own handlers, but there\u2019s another great library that can do this for us: argparse. It includes infrastructure to parse labeled arguments, display help messages if improper input is provided, and set default values if you wish to make user-provided arguments optional. The official documentation is pretty great, but we\u2019ll provide an example or two here as quick-start reference.\nUsing Argparse\nThere are two main types of arguments we can work with when using argparse: optional and positional. Optional arguments are specified with a label preceded by two dashes, and followed by the user input,\n e.g.--filename myfile.txt They can be placed in any order. Positional arguments do not require any labels, but must be in the expected order to be parsed correctly. For example, if your program takes input and output filenames as command-line arguments, you could set the first argument to be the input file, and the second the output file- python my_program.py input.txt output.txt . But if you switch the order of the file names, the output file would be parsed as the input file and vice-versa.\nFirst, an example using optional arguments. \nimport argparse\nparser = argparse.ArgumentParser()\nparser.add_argument(\u2018--firstarg\u2019, help=\u2019explanatory help text here\u2019)\nparser.add_argument(\u2018--secondarg\u2019, help=\u2019explanatory help text here\u2019)\nargs = parser.parse_args()\nand to use the argument data, you can access it as member of the args object:\nfirst_arg = args.firstarg\nsecond_arg = args.secondard\nSo with the above syntax, we could invoke the program like this- \npython my_program.py --firstarg hello --secondarg world \nor like this:\npython my_progam.py --secondarg world --firstarg hello \nand the behavior would be same.\nNow, if we wanted to use positional arguments, we would just omit the double dash when we call add_argument(), and the arguments will be parsed according to their order on invocation:\nparser.add_argument(\u2018firstarg\u2019, help=\u2019explanatory help text here\u2019)\nparser.add_argument(\u2018secondarg\u2019, help=\u2019explanatory help text here\u2019)\nThis would be invoked like so:\npython my_program.py hello world \nbut if you reversed the order of the arguments, you would get \u201chello\u201d as args.secondarg .\nTwo more useful features we\u2019ll touch on briefly are specifying data types and setting defaults. \nSetting a data type can be helpful in recognizing and handling incorrect input, and also make your code a little cleaner. If you know that a certain option should always be parsed as an int, you can force that:\nparser.add_argument(\u2018--firstarg\u2019, type=int, help=\u2019explanatory help text here\u2019)\n You could also specify a string or float; see the full list of options here.\nSetting defaults can be very handy as well, and is just a straightforward:\nparser.add_argument(\u2018--firstarg\u2019, default='hello', help=\u2019explanatory help text here\u2019)\nDefault values are helpful in simplifying the user experience if input is only necessary in certain modes or circumstances- rather than requiring a large list of arguments for every invocation, the user will only need to supply the minimum input necessary. They can also be helpful in avoiding or handling error \u2014 e.g. rather than throwing a Value Error and terminating if certain input was not supplied, you might choose to give the user a second chance to enter data, or proceed under default behavior.\nConclusion\nThanks for reading!

Rules like \u201cPasswords must include a capital letter and a number\u201d or those little \u201cstrength meters\u201d that give you the reassuring green checkmark that your password is impenetrable are dangerously misleading and incomplete. Some of the reasons are mathematical, but a lot of it has to do with human behavior as well. Let\u2019s take a look at the math behind the curtain, and why an understanding of human habits can defeat the most powerful algorithms.\nPart 1: How do passwords work?\nWhen you type your password and press enter to log in to an account, your web-browser runs code that hashes your password, converting it into a long string of seemingly random letters, numbers, and symbols- from which it is impossible to tell what the original input was. This hash is stored on the server, so each time you log in, the hashes are compared- not your plain password. This way, only you know your password- not even system administrators can see it, and if the server is breached by hackers, they will only see the garbled-looking hash.\nThe crux of this process is the hash function \u2014the specific mathematical operations that change your password into this gibberish. Hash functions can be quite complex, but the basic idea is something pretty familiar. Let\u2019s say our function is just simple addition, and our input is 2 integers as the \u2018password\u2019. You set a \u2018password\u2019 of 3 and 4. This is \u2018hashed\u2019 to 7 (3 +4 =7). Only this 7 is stored on the server. If a hacker gains access to the server and finds this \u2018hash\u2019, he has no way of knowing whether your \u2018password\u2019 is 3 and 4, or 1 and 6, or 5 and 2. This is a crucial point: you cannot conclusively determine the original input from the output. Hash functions are one-way. (This is different than encryption, where you can easily regain the original input). Now, this example of addition as a hash function is incomplete- if the server just knows your numbers should equal 7, then any 2 numbers that sum to 7 will work to guess your \u2018password.\u2019 This is called having many collisions- when two or more inputs result in the same hashed output. So, we need to add some transformation that results in as few collisions as possible, but still avoid any reversible operations. Let\u2019s try concatenating the original digits, and multiplying the resulting number by our sum. So for 3 and 4, we\u2019d have 3 + 4 = 7, then 7 * 34 = 238. For 5 and 2, we\u2019d have 5 + 2 = 7, then 7 * 52 = 364. \nRemember, any guess that we make has to be in the form of 2 numbers, so we\u2019d have to calculate the entire answer for each set of 2 numbers we want to guess. So what two numbers give us the output 1305?\nYou could probably figure it out eventually with a calculator, or faster by writing a program to guess and check, but it would take some work. This is basically the idea behind modern password hashing. Modern hash functions are highly complex, and take a computer a relatively large amount of energy to calculate. So even when we know what the formula is and what the output hash is, we have to invest such a large amount of computational time to guess that it becomes prohibitive to try. As we\u2019ll explore below, it could take a computer easily thousands of years to guess a password. In fact, it\u2019s been shown that with certain hash functions, the heat-death of the universe would occur before we could calculate all possible hashes with current global computing power.\nPart 2: Hash Cracking: It\u2019s all Guess-and-Check\nThe only way to \u201ccrack\u201d a password is to calculate the hash for a given input, and see if it matches the hash you\u2019re trying to crack- i.e. guess and check. So for example, say the hash function called MD5 takes 3000 CPU cycles to calculate (the actual number varies by formula and computer system), and maybe it takes 10 cycles to compare and see if the hashes are the same\u2026 so 3010 cycles to check one hash. If you have a 10 character password, there\u2019s 72\u00b9\u2070 possible permutations of lowercase letters, capital letters, digits, and symbols (possibly more depending on what symbols are allow as input)- about 3.75 quintillion possibilities. So with one core of a typical 3GHz CPU and about 3000 cycles per hash, we have 3 billion cycles per second divided by 3000 cycles per hash = 1 million hashes per second. One quintillion is a thousand billion millions, so 3.75 trillion seconds to calculate all possible combinations\u2026which is about 118,833 years of constant CPU time at 1 million hashes per second. We\u2019ll come back to this in a moment.\n\nIt might help to understand exactly what happens in a hash formula, and why that takes CPU cycles. The short answer is, it\u2019s just a bunch of math operations. In a modern PC CPU, you have registers which hold 64 bit binary numbers, and the CPU can perform basic logic operations on those, like AND-ing two numbers together, or comparing them for equality. To do that, enough electricity has to be run through the transistors that make up the CPU to cause the electrons to move a \u201cstep forward\u201d through the logic gates- similar to how a certain amount of electricity is required to make an electric motor revolve one time. So, a hash formula typically involves doing enough math to require at least a few thousand of these operations.\nMost real hash functions are quite intensive, and guarantee unique outputs for each input, etc. But modern CPUs have many cores, and you can also leverage the cloud\u2026.so say we have a bunch of cloud servers that totals 100 cores at 3GHz- using our example above of 118,833 years of single-core CPU, that would get us down to 1188 years\u2026.say we have a giant server farm with ten-thousand cores, we can get it down to 0.1188 years (about 6 weeks). That\u2019s for every possible hash, of course- i.e. we would have cracked every single possible password. If we were just trying to find a single hash, we might get lucky and crack it in perhaps a measly couple decades.\nPart 3: How to Crack a Password\nIn reality, we don\u2019t need to guess all the possibilities. Most people use combinations of letters and numbers that relate to their lives- e.g. English words and numbers from their birthdate- so we can vastly reduce the amount of guesses we need to take. For example, we could feed a list of every word in the English language into the popular cracking program Hashcat, and instruct it to calculate hashes for each word followed by the numbers 0 to 999. So rounding up to 200,000 words in English, plus 1000 following numbers for each one is 200,000 *1000 = 200 million possibilities, which would take 200 seconds at 1 million hashes/second. Not too bad.\nOf course, most sites have \u201cstrength\u201d requirements, like \u201cyour password must include at least one number, one capital letter, and one symbol.\u201d Mathematically this is a great idea, but it doesn\u2019t take into account what people actually do, and consequently these \u201cstrength\u201d rules play right into hackers\u2019 hands. A rule like this makes it harder for people to make a password they can remember, so we tend to head straight for common patterns and sequences. Most people will just capitalize the first letter of a word, put a common number like 123, 456, or a recent year, on the end, then a symbol that is easy to reach while holding the shift key- typically an exclamation point, at-sign, pound-sign, or asterisk (Yes, the keyboard layout affects how people choose passwords- \u201casdf\u201d and \u201cqwerty\u201d are some recognizable common patterns). So in practice, these requirements actually make passwords LESS safe- sure, they prevent absolutely terrible passwords like \u201cpassword\u201d, but overall they make even complex passwords much easier to guess.\n\nWe also know that everyone reuses passwords- not just their own, but we tend to come up with the same passwords as other people. Even when we think we\u2019re coming with a \u201crandom\u201d sequence, or something highly personal and original, it has usually been used by other people. We\u2019re just not that different. Even when we create things that are \u201crandom,\u201d we tend to pick sequences that are easier to type, or that are pronounceable in our native language. Cybersecurity researchers estimate that only about 7 billion distinct passwords are in use currently. In our earlier example of 1 million hashes/second, calculating 7 billion hashes would take 116 minutes. And modern GPUs and distributed systems can easily do billions per second.\nSo when trying to crack a password, or a whole stolen database of hashes, we want to take all these things into account and compile a list of possibilities that is most likely to crack the most hashes:\nWords found in the most-spoken languages\n2. Common numbers, such as sequences, birthdates, recent years.\n3. Passwords that have been used before- large lists of these, known as \u201ccracking dictionaries,\u201d are publicly available.\n4. Symbols and capital letters in common places \u2014 first and last characters, easy to reach from the shift key, etc.\n5. Small phrases like \u201ciloveyou\u201d or \u201cdonthackme\u201d\n6. If targeting a specific website, statistically many passwords will contain the name of the site, e.g. \u201cfacebook123\u201d\nDepending on what other information is available about the target users, it may be possible to further refine the list (e.g. names, nationalities, etc). \nWe know that this is actually how threat actors operate. Cybersecurity research has observed \u201ccredential stuffing\u201d bots in the wild communicating with command-and-control (C2) servers that provide them with parameters (i.e. guessing rules) to target victims based on heuristics very similar to those described in the list above. Cracking websites and programs like Hashcat have evolved to make developing and applying these rules easier and faster. So how do we fight back?\nPart 4: How to Make Your Password Strong\nWell, in theory this is easy- just don\u2019t act like a human. But as we all know, that\u2019s easier said than done. So let a computer do it for you, and use a strong password generator. This ensures that your password is not only mathematically robust, but that it is safe from behavior-based guessing. Of course, there is no 100% guarantee that even a random string of characters can\u2019t be guessed (or that you won\u2019t get malware that logs your keystrokes, or steals the passwords saved in your browser), so it\u2019s also a good idea to have different random passwords for every account. Even remembering one long random string is hard, so the best way to implement this is with the help of a password manager like LastPass.\nChanging habits is hard, however, and it\u2019s better to improve than do nothing, so if you must continue devising your own passwords, try doing the opposite of what a human would do:\nuse words to make nonsensical phrases (\u201cparkinglot-bathtub-arboretum\u201d)\nplace capital letters at random or in the middle of a phrase (\u201cparkingLot-bathtub-ARBORetum\u201d)\nuse non-sequential numbers and a wide array of symbols (\u201cparkingLot%bath395tub@@&ARBORetum\u201d)\ndon\u2019t use any identifying information about you or the site/service.\nmake sure your password is not already in a cracking dictionary.\nIf you\u2019re a sysadmin or software developer, consider using credential screening services that check all your users against known compromised accounts and passwords, and continuously update their databases as more passwords are cracked or leaked in data exposures.", "comment_count": 4, "like_count": 145, "created_time": 1642367100504, "comment": [{"user_id": "3c56044aa79f", "comment_time": 1642367100504, "comment": "Thank you for sharing!"}, {"user_id": "584d02d4807a", "comment_time": 1649107421428, "comment": "I got the best help with www.cyber-prime.com, i lost some money in a shady investment.

If you are the root user of your AWS account, you can find instructions on getting the access key ID and secret here; or ask your cloud sysadmin to get you credentials for programmatic access. \nIf you haven\u2019t already installed the AWS command-line interface (CLI), do that first (see the guide here). Then you can run aws configure to set up your credentials locally. \nNote: You can pass the credentials directly to the boto.client() function or when creating a boto Session() object in your script, but hard-coding any credentials is NOT recommended. Unless you have an advanced use-case, I would avoid this. (If you wanted to pass the credentials in as command-line arguments when running your script, that would be okay, but that\u2019s likely to just be more work. The major advantages would be script portability and easy swapping of AWS accounts.)\nIf you are using an EC2 instance (or Lambda) to run your script, you have the option of using IAM roles instead of credentials. This mode is less flexible, in that you must assign an IAM role with the necessary S3 permissions when you create the instance. So if you need to switch machines or AWS accounts, you\u2019ll be stuck re-creating your instance. However, this method is more secure since there are no credentials to be stolen or exposed. And, if you have a well-established service, you can save your instance configuration and easily redeploy or scale as necessary. Boto3 support for native IAM roles is pretty smooth as well, so if you are deploying to prod on AWS servers, this is the way to go. Setting up the IAM roles is a bit outside the scope of this article, but we will cover how to handle the use of this method in your script.\n*There are various services that are essentially cloud re-sellers, or cloud management providers that may run on top of the AWS cloud, and though not strictly AWS, can offer native IAM integration.\nWriting the Code\nOkay, so you\u2019ve got your authentication figured out, and you\u2019re ready to get things running. First, make sure you make the library accessible:import boto3. Side note- I like to wrap any AWS operations in their own function- e.g. upload_to_s3(file_path, destination) or download_from_s3(bucket, file_name) or list_s3_directory(directory) , etc. Not only does it make your code more reusable and save you the time of rewriting the same procedures, but it can make your script more human-readable and debugging easier.\nNow, the S3 API has a full list of the available functions, but the general approach will be the same for each one with regard to execution. We\u2019ll use uploading a file as an example.\nUsing Credential Authentication:\nFirst we\u2019ll create the boto3 session, which lets us specify which AWS profile we\u2019d like to use- important if you keep your dev and prod access separate (good practice). \nsession = boto3.Session(profile_name=\u2019dev\u2019)\nYou can just call the function with no arguments to use your default profile; I recommend being explicit so that there\u2019s no confusion or accidental permissions mistakes if the default profile is changed in the future, or the script is run on a different machine. You can also pass the credentials in directly as strings to authenticate the session without establishing a profile, but, again, avoid doing this unless absolutely necessary. \nNext we\u2019ll establish a client for the S3 service itself-\ndev_s3_client = session.resource(\u2018s3\u2019)\nNow we\u2019re ready to use any of the exposed S3 functions; for example, to upload a file we\u2019ll need the local path, the name of the S3 bucket, and any S3 subdirectory information as a separate string to specify the destination:\ndev_s3_client.meta.client.upload_file(file_name, \u2018my-s3-bucket\u2019, \u2018my-files/uploads/file_name\u2019)\nI usually just create a string for the destination argument by specifying the subdirectories and concatenating with the file name- if you're creating automation or will be uploading files where the names are determined at run time, you'll need some way to handle it dynamically- destination = \u201cmy-files/uploaded/\u201d + file_name \nWith your session active, you can perform whatever other functions you\u2019d like. If you wrap your code in a function, the session will end when the function it was created in returns. \nUsing IAM Roles\nIf you set up an IAM role with appropriate permissions, you don\u2019t even need to create a Session as described above- just go ahead and create the resource client:\ndev_s3_client = boto3.resource(\u2018s3\u2019)\nand upload your file:\ndev_s3_client.meta.client.upload_file(file_name, \u2018my-s3-bucket\u2019, \u2018my-files/uploads/file_name\u2019)\nand you\u2019re good to go!", "comment_count": 0, "like_count": 5, "created_time": 1636608572410, "comment": [], "post_tag": ["AWS", "Python", "Programming", "Data", "Cloud Computing"]}]
